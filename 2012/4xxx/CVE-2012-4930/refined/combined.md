An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

dropdown menu can be used for URL spoofing, other evil
Firefox 10.0.1 : Navigation away from a page with
multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*
CVE-2012-3995: Out of bounds read in
IsCSSWordSpacingSpace
\*
CVE-2012-4179: Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn
\*

nsTextEditRules::WillInsert
\*
CVE-2012-4183: Heap-use-after-free in
DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures
\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-4185: Global-buffer-overflow in
nsCharTraits::length
\*
CVE-2012-4186: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData
\*
CVE-2012-4187: Crash with ASSERTION: insPos too small
\*
CVE-2012-4188: Heap-buffer-overflow in Convolve3x3
\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

Researchers have identified a security weakness that allows them to hijack web browser sessions even when they're protected by the HTTPS encryption that banks and e-commerce sites use to prevent snooping on sensitive transactions.

The technique exploits web sessions protected by the Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols when they use one of two data-compression schemes designed to reduce network congestion or the time it takes for webpages to load. Short for Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy, CRIME works only when both the browser and server support [TLS compression](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3749.txt) or [SPDY](http://www.chromium.org/spdy), an open networking protocol used by both Google and Twitter. Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox browsers are all believed to be immune to the attack, but at time of writing smartphone browsers and a myriad of other applications that rely on TLS are believed to remain vulnerable.

CRIME is the latest black eye for the widely used encryption protocols, which act as the Internet's foundation of trust by encrypting traffic that flows over open networks and cryptographically proving websites such as [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) are really operated by Google rather than criminal hackers or state-sponsored spies. The specter of a new attack that could subvert one of the only widely available protections preventing the interception of sensitive e-mails and web transactions, follows revelations that both Iran and China have actively worked to defeat it so they could spy on its citizens.

"The CRIME attack is the nation-state attack," Matthew Green, a professor specializing in cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, told Ars. "It's not something that some hackers are going to do when you're sitting in Starbucks. It's really something that Iran is going to do to try to find dissidents or China is going to do for the same reason. And it's a big deal because of that, especially if Google and Twitter are the ones who are vulnerable."

Representatives from Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft said their companies' browsers are no longer vulnerable to CRIME attacks. Both Chrome and Firefox were susceptible until recently. Google and Mozilla released patches after the weaknesses were privately reported by Juliano Rizzo ([@julianor](https://twitter.com/julianor)) and Thai Duong, the researchers who devised the CRIME exploits. Internet Explorer was never vulnerable because it never supported SPDY (pronounced "speedy") or the TLS compression scheme known as Deflate.

That still leaves open the possibility that a raft of smaller browsers are susceptible. [This webpage](http://caniuse.com/spdy) maintained by self-described "Web tinkerer" and Adobe employee Alexis Deveria says that SPDY is supported in beta versions of Opera and production versions of both Firefox and Chrome for Android, as well as the Android browser.

Apple's Safari browser doesn't support SPDY, but its use of compression is unknown. A representative of Opera said there's no support for compression in the browser and SPDY is available only in beta versions. The status of TLS compression in smaller browsers also remained unknown at time of writing. Rizzo told Ars that encryption schemes used in a variety of chat applications, virtual private networks, and other software may also be vulnerable.

Even when a browser is vulnerable, an HTTPS session can only be hijacked when one of those browsers is used to connect to a site that supports SPDY or TLS compression. The [Qualys SSL Labs page](https://www.ssllabs.com/index.html), which tracks the quality of sites that offer HTTPS protection, shows that services offered by [Google](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.google.com&s=74.125.142.100) and [Twitter](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=twitter.com&s=199.59.150.39) support SPDY. Ivan Ristic, director of engineering at Qualys, told Ars that 42 percent of sites surveyed by his service support TLS compression. A demonstration video taken by Rizzo and Duong on Wednesday shows Github.com, Dropbox.com, and Stripe.com, when visited with a then-patched version of Chrome, succumbing to the CRIME attack, although all three of those sites had disabled compression at time of writing, meaning they are no longer vulnerable.

CRIME vs startups

Both the [GnuTLS](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/) and [OpenSSL](http://openssl.org/) TLS implementations for clients and servers respectively support TLS, making it easy for developers and engineers to fold it into web servers.

## The chosen one

Rizzo and Duong are the architects of a [separate attack from last year that also defeated TLS protection](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/19/beast_exploits_paypal_ssl/). It was dubbed BEAST and was short for Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS). Like that attack, compression-based exploits wield what cryptographers call a chosen plaintext attack on an encrypted session. The technique mixes clear-text data under the control of the attacker with the encrypted payload being targeted. By modifying the clear-text payload hundreds or thousands of times and watching how each one interacts with the encrypted data, an attacker can deduce its contents, usually character by character.

Such attacks can be particularly useful against SSL, since the beginning of each web HTML request contains an authentication cookie with a secret key (which may look something like XS8b1MWZ0QEKJtM1t+QCofRpCsT2u). In a CRIME attack, the encrypted message is combined with attacker-controlled JavaScript that, letter by letter, performs a brute-force attack on the secret key. When it guesses the letter X as the first character of the cookie secret, the encrypted message will appear differently than an encrypted message that uses W or Y. Once the first character is correctly guessed, the attack repeats the process again on the next character in the key until the remainder of the secret is deduced.

Once the session cookie is decrypted, hackers can exploit it to gain unauthorized access to the user account the session cookie is designed to authenticate. The process from start to finish takes "a few minutes," Rizzo said.

Data compression reduces the number of bytes contained in a file or data stream by removing redundant information. CRIME forces a web browser to compress and encrypt requests that contain attacker-controlled data that is combined with the cookie secret. If one of the requests produces fewer encrypted network packets, that's an indication there's more redundancy in the request, and hence the attacker data and the secret data have more information in common. CRIME algorithms decrypt the session cookies by guessing their contents byte by byte. The attacks don't require any browser plugins, and the use of JavaScript isn't necessary, although it does make the brute-force attack faster.

A side effect of compression, security experts have long known, is that it leaks clues about the encrypted contents. That means it provides a "side channel" to adversaries who have the ability to monitor the data. A [research paper published in 2002](http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/FSE/3091/3091.pdf) by John Kelsey looks eerily similar to CRIME, but only in retrospect.

"I don't think anyone realized that this enables an attack on HTTP over TLS, or that an attacker could learn the value of secret cookies sent over a TLS-encrypted connection," a participant in [this online discussion](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19911/crime-how-to-beat-the-beast-successor/19914#19914) observed. "The paper looks at attacks on compression mainly in the abstract, rather than in the specific context of the web, and is pretty theoretical. So, CRIME (or Thomas Pornin's attack) is still a significant novel extension of these ideas."

("Pornin's attack" is a reference to an exploit described in [this blog post](http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/), where the well-known cryptographer by that name correctly guessed how CRIME worked based on bare-bones clues offered in previous news coverage of the attack. Other speculation that proved to be correct is [here](http://blog.kotowicz.net/2012/09/if-its-crime-than-im-guilty.html).)

## Chain of fools

Last year's BEAST attack worked only against an encryption mode known as cipher block chaining. That limitation allowed engineers to block attacks by using encryption ~~algorithms~~ ciphers such as RC4, which don't rely on the mode. There is no such restriction with compression attacks, so the only known way to block them is to disable TLS compression or apply a SPDY patch that's comparable to the one [recently added to Chrome](https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10825183).

Rizzo and Duong are [scheduled to demonstrate CRIME](http://www.ekoparty.org/2012/juliano-rizzo.php) on September 21 at the Ekoparty security conference in Buenos Aires. Although the attack no longer works on the three most popular browsers to connect to HTTPS-protected websites, CRIME is a potent reminder of the fragility of the protection of encryption. But it likely won't be the last.

"It is easy to try the idea with a short script," Rizzo told Ars. "It's a practical attack against HTTPS and could be a starting point to attack other secure protocols. It's another powerful tool for attackers with access to your network."

*Story updated to add Safari, Opera details, make clear that both Chrome and Firefox were vulnerable until recently.*

More details have emerged of a new attack that allows hackers to hijack encrypted web traffic - such as online banking and shopping protected by HTTPS connections.

The so-called CRIME technique lures a vulnerable web browser into leaking an authentication cookie created when a user starts a secure session with a website. Once the cookie has been obtained, it can be used by hackers to login to the victim's account on the site.

The cookie is deduced by tricking the browser into sending compressed encrypted requests to a HTTPS website and exploiting information inadvertently leaked in the process. Each sent request contains the cookie and some extra data that is tweaked by malicious JavaScript code. The change in size of the sent compressed messages is measured to determine the cookie's contents character by character.

CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy) was created by security researchers Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong, who cooked up the [BEAST SSL exploit](https://www.theregister.com/2011/09/19/beast_exploits_paypal_ssl/) last year. CRIME works on any version of TLS, the underlying technology that protects HTTPS connections. The number of requests an attacker would need to make to pull off the hijack is fairly low - up to six requests per cookie byte. Unlike the BEAST attack, CRIME can't be defeated by configuring the web server to use a different encryption algorithm.

Punters using web browsers that implement either TLS or SPDY compression are potentially at risk - but the vulnerability only comes into play if the victim visits a website that accepts the affected protocols. Support is widespread but far from ubiquitous.

The researchers worked with Mozilla and Google to ensure that both Firefox and Chrome are protected. Microsoft's Internet Explorer is not vulnerable to the attack, and only beta versions of Opera support SPDY. Smartphone browsers and other applications that rely on TLS may be vulnerable, [according to Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/crime-hijacks-https-sessions).

"Basically, the attacker is running a script on Evil.com," Rizzo [explained to Kaspersky Labs' Threatpost](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/crime-attack-uses-compression-ratio-tls-requests-side-channel-hijack-secure-sessions-091312). "He forces the browser to open requests to Bank.com by, for example, adding <img alt=""> tags with the src pointing to Bank.com. Each of those requests contains data from mixed sources."

Each encrypted request includes an image file name - a constantly changing detail that is generated by the malicious script; the browser's identification headers, which don't change; and the login cookie, the target of the attack. When the file name matches part of the login cookie, the size of the message drops because the compression algorithm removes this redundancy.

"The problem is that compression combines all those sources together," Rizzo added. "The attacker can sniff the packets and get the size of the requests that are sent. By changing the [file name] path, he could attempt to minimise the request size, ie: when the file name matches the cookie."

This brute-force attack has been demonstrated against several sites including Dropbox, Github and Stripe. Affected organisations were notified by the pair, and the websites have reportedly suspended support for the leaky encryption compression protocols. Ivan Ristic, director of engineering at Qualys, estimates 42 percent of sites support TLS compression.

The researchers will present their work at the Ekoparty security conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina next week. In the meantime, Jeremiah Grossman, founder and chief technology officer of WhiteHat Security, has a detailed take on the attack [here](http://blog.whitehatsec.com/crime-mitm-and-xss/). ®

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=857737#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-16 16:44:28 UTC  ``` [CVE-2012-4930](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4930) was assigned to the following issue:  The SPDY protocol 3 and earlier, as used in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and other products, can perform TLS encryption of compressed data without properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers by observing length differences during a series of guesses in which a string in an HTTP request potentially matches an unknown string in an HTTP header, aka a "CRIME" attack.  References:  <http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/crime-hijacks-https-sessions/> <http://isecpartners.com/blog/2012/9/14/details-on-the-crime-attack.html> <http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/crime-attack-uses-compression-ratio-tls-requests-side-channel-hijack-secure-sessions-091312> <http://www.ekoparty.org/2012/thai-duong.php> <http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/paper.php?pubkey=3091> <http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/14/crime_tls_attack/> <https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2012/09/14/crime-information-leakage-attack-against-ssltls>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=857737#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-16 16:51:41 UTC  ``` Reporters of the CRIME attack have published two variants of the attack:  - SSL/TLS connection with zlib compression - that issue got [CVE-2012-4929](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4929) and is tracked via [bug 857051](show_bug.cgi?id=857051 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-4929 SSL/TLS CRIME attack against HTTPS") - SPDY protocol with header compression used over SSL/TLS connection without zlib compression, tracked via this bug  [Bug 857051](show_bug.cgi?id=857051 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-4929 SSL/TLS CRIME attack against HTTPS") already contains additional information and links regarding the CRIME attack.  It also notes (in [bug 857051, comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-4929 SSL/TLS CRIME attack against HTTPS")) that Mozilla Firefox versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 do not support SPDY protocol, and are therefore unaffected by the SPDY attack vector.  Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of Firefox as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did not include SPDY protocol support.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=857737#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-24 07:41:27 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 859827](show_bug.cgi?id=859827 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2012-3977 Mozilla: SPDY information disclosure (MFSA 2012-73)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=857737#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-24 16:25:24 UTC  ``` Adam Langley's (Google developer working on Chrome) blog post explaining some details of the attack, change that was applied to block SPDY attack variant (SPDY compression was disabled in Firefox 15 and Chrome 21), and some changes planned for future SPDY versions that would allow re-enabling header compression without re-introducing this problem.  <http://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/09/21/crime.html>   ``` |  |
