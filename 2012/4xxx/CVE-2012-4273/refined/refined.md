The provided content relates to CVE-2012-4273.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from a lack of sanitization of user-provided URLs used in the Xing and Pinterest sharing buttons within the "2-click-socialmedia-buttons" WordPress plugin. The plugin directly used the `$_REQUEST['xing-url']` and `$_REQUEST['pinterest-url']` parameters without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability was the potential for XSS attacks. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the `xing-url` or `pinterest-url` parameters, which would then be executed in the context of the user's browser when they interacted with the share button.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS attacks could allow an attacker to perform actions such as:
   - Stealing cookies and session data
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites
   - Defacing the website
   - Executing arbitrary code within the user's browser
   - Gaining unauthorized access to the user's account

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector was through crafted URLs within the `xing-url` or `pinterest-url` parameters when a user clicked on the share button.
- A malicious user could craft a link that, when shared using the plugin, would execute malicious code in the browser of anyone who viewed the shared link and then interacted with the Xing or Pinterest buttons.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the URL that is shared by the user.
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL and trick users into sharing it.
- The attacker could also post a link on a website that was configured with this plugin.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability included stripping HTML tags from the URL parameters using `strip_tags()` and using `esc_url()` to sanitize the URL for use in the `uri` parameter.
- This patch was released in version 0.34 of the plugin.
- The vulnerable code was present in `libs/pinterest.php` and `libs/xing.php`, specifically in how the URLs were handled in the share button links.
