And this is why I should probably be more aggressive about asking for
commits to be broken out by software version if multiple versions are
affected =).

Ok let's continue to use CVE-2012-4464 for the exc_to_s() and
name_err_to_s() issues which affect 1.9.3-p0 and newer.

For name_err_mesg_to_str() which affects both 1.9.3-p0 and newer and
1.8.x please use CVE-2012-4466.

# $SAFE escaping vulnerability about Exception#to\_s / NameError#to\_s (CVE-2012-4464, CVE-2012-4466)

Posted by usa on 12 Oct 2012

Vulnerabilities found for Exception#to\_s, NameError#to\_s, and
name\_err\_mesg\_to\_s() which is Ruby interpreter-internal API. A
malicious user code can bypass $SAFE check by utilizing one of those
security holes.

## Details

Ruby's $SAFE mechanism enables untrusted user codes to run in $SAFE
>= 4 mode. This is a kind of sandboxing so some operations are
restricted in that mode to protect other data outside the sandbox.

The problem found was around this mechanism. Exception#to\_s,
NameError#to\_s, and name\_err\_mesg\_to\_s() interpreter-internal API
was not correctly handling the $SAFE bits so a String object which is
not tainted can destructively be marked as tainted using them. By using
this an untrusted code in a sandbox can modify a formerly-untainted
string destructively.

Ruby 1.8 once had a [similar security issue](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2011/02/18/exception-methods-can-bypass-safe/). It fixed
Exception#to\_s and NameError#to\_s, but name\_err\_mesg\_to\_str()
issue survived previous security fix.

## Affected versions

* all Ruby 1.8.7 prior to patchlevel 371
* all Ruby 1.9.3 prior to patchlevel 286
* all development branches of Ruby 2.0 prior to revision r37068

## Solution

Upgrade to a latest version.

## Credit

This vulnerability was found by Tyler Hickes.

Subject: CVE Request: Ruby safe level bypasses

Hello - Upstream Ruby has fixed[1] exception methods that incorrectly
allowed safe level bypasses. These bypasses allowed untainted strings to
be modified by untrusted code in safe level 4.

Note that the changes to exc_to_s() and name_err_to_s(), in error.c, are
similar to the fix for CVE-2011-1005, but the Ruby advisory[2] made it
clear that Ruby 1.9.x was not affected by CVE-2011-1005. It turns out
that the vulnerability was later reintroduced to Ruby's trunk in
revision 29456. Ruby 1.9.3-p0 and later is affected.

While Shugo Maeda was fixing the issue above, he noticed that
name_err_mesg_to_str() had a similar flaw. Ruby 1.8.x, along with
1.9.3-p0 and later is affected.

I believe that these issues need two separate CVEs. Both issues are
fixed in the same upstream patch[1]. Could you please allocate ids?

Thanks,
Tyler

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=7769#c0)  David Walser    2012-10-11 15:24:44 CEST  ``` Ubuntu has issued an advisory on October 10: <http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1603-1/>  Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 1 and Mageia 2.  Advisory: ========================  Updated ruby packages fix security vulnerabilities:  Shugo Maedo and Vit Ondruch discovered that Ruby incorrectly allowed untainted strings to be modified in protective safe levels. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended access restrictions (CVE-2012-4466, CVE-2012-4481).
