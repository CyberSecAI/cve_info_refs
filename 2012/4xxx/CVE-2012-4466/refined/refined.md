Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4466:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `name_err_mesg_to_str()` method within the Ruby interpreter. This method incorrectly handles the `$SAFE` bits, leading to a bypass of the intended security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **$SAFE Level Bypass:** The core issue is that the `name_err_mesg_to_str()` method allows untrusted code in a safe level (specifically `$SAFE >= 4`) to modify previously untainted strings. The `$SAFE` mechanism in Ruby is meant to restrict operations in untrusted code, and this vulnerability allows that restriction to be circumvented.
- **Incorrect Tainting:**  The vulnerable method can mark a String object as tainted, even when it shouldn't be based on the `$SAFE` level, this is a destructive operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Modification of Untainted Strings:** A malicious actor can use the vulnerability to alter the content of strings that should be protected by the `$SAFE` level. This could lead to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or even further security breaches depending on how these modified strings are used.
- **Sandbox Escape:** By modifying untainted strings, attackers can potentially escape the sandboxed environment provided by safe levels.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Exploitation would involve invoking the vulnerable `name_err_mesg_to_str()` method within a Ruby program running under a specific safe level, crafted to cause a string to become tainted when it shouldn't be.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to execute Ruby code in a $SAFE >= 4 environment:** Attackers need to be able to run Ruby code that is subject to the `$SAFE` restrictions, to perform the attack, meaning it needs to be "untrusted code".
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** Attackers need to be aware of the `name_err_mesg_to_str()` flaw and how to trigger it.

**Affected Versions:**
- Ruby 1.8.x
- Ruby 1.9.3-p0 and later (prior to patchlevel 286)
- All development branches of Ruby 2.0 prior to revision r37068

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is similar to a previously fixed issue (CVE-2011-1005) related to `Exception#to_s` and `NameError#to_s`, but it affects a different method (`name_err_mesg_to_str()`) and also has different version impact.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in the same patch that addresses CVE-2012-4464.
- This issue was discovered by Shugo Maeda while addressing a similar issue, and a second report came in from Tyler Hicks.
