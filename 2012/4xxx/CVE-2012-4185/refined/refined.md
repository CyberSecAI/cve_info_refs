  "CVE-2012-4185": {
    "description": "Global-buffer-overflow in nsCharTraits::length",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs in the `nsCharTraits::length` function within the Mozilla networking library. The function incorrectly calculates the length of a string, leading to a buffer overflow when processing certain character sequences. Specifically, when `nsUTF16ToUnicodeBase::GetMaxLength` returns zero, but there is still data, `WriteSegmentFun` attempts to overwrite the buffer with a replacement character (0xFFFD) without correctly resizing the buffer, leading to writing past the end of the buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Global-buffer-overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution due to the overflow. The crash occurs when `nsCharTraits<unsigned short>::length` attempts to read past the end of the `gNullChar` variable.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a crafted character sequence during network operations that leads to the described scenario in `nsUnicharStreamLoader::DetermineCharset()` which then calls `WriteSegmentFun`. This is likely within CSS parsing.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to provide a specially crafted string to the vulnerable function. This is likely achieved by tricking a user into opening a malicious website or document. Additionally, they need to have knowledge of the vulnerable code path to trigger the overflow correctly."
  },
    "CVE-2012-4186": {
    "description": "Heap-buffer-overflow in nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData",
    "root_cause": "A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData` function. This occurs because of improper validation of the frame size in a WAVE file, which leads to an out-of-bounds read when decoding the audio data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
          "Improper input validation"
    ],
     "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a crash, and potentially arbitrary code execution due to the heap overflow, given it's a memory corruption issue. There is a possibility of exploitation via a malformed wave file.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to provide a specially crafted WAVE audio file. This could be achieved by tricking a user into opening a malicious website or document with the malformed file, or by injecting the file into the context.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted WAVE audio file, and have the system process it. User interaction is likely needed, such as visiting a malicious page. A vulnerable build of firefox is needed."
