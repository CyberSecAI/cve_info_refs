- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the way Google SketchUp parses specially crafted SKP files, leading to a read access violation and memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption due to improper parsing of SKP files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted SKP file. This could be achieved through social engineering tactics such as sending the malicious file via email, instant messaging, or hosting it on a website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted SKP file. They also need to convince the user to open the file using a vulnerable version of Google SketchUp. This typically involves social engineering techniques.
