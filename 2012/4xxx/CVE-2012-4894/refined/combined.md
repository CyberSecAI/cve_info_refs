## Memory Corruption in Google SketchUp Could Allow Arbitrary Code Execution

Published: September 18, 2012

**Version:** 1.0

### Overview

#### Executive Summary

Microsoft is providing notification of the discovery and remediation of a vulnerability affecting Google SketchUp software version 8.0.11752.0 and earlier. Microsoft discovered and disclosed the vulnerability under coordinated vulnerability disclosure to the affected vendor, Google. Google has remediated the vulnerability in their software.

A vulnerability exists in the way that SketchUp parses specially crafted SketchUp document (SKP) files resulting in memory corruption that could allow arbitrary code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported this issue to and coordinated with Google to ensure remediation of this issue. The vulnerability has been assigned the entry, CVE-2012-4894, in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information, see the [SketchUp Release Notes](https://support.google.com/sketchup/bin/static.py?hl=en&page=release_notes.cs).

#### Mitigating Factors

* This vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of this advisory?**

This advisory is part of a coordinated release with affected vendors to inform customers of a security issue that may affect their systems.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

No. This vulnerability has been fixed via an update from the affected third-party vendors. The update remediates the software listed in the table, **Affected Software**.

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by the way that SketchUp parses SKP files resulting in a read access violation.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted file with an affected version of SketchUp. Typically specially crafted files are delivered via social engineering techniques in email, instant messaging, or via download links on websites. This vulnerability cannot be exploited without user interaction.

## Suggested Actions

Update to the current version of Google SketchUp.
