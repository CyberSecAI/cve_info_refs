    "CVE-2012-4655": {
      "summary": "Cisco Secure Desktop contains an arbitrary code execution vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on systems that have received the ActiveX or Java components that perform the WebLaunch functionality for Cisco Secure Desktop. The attacker may supply vulnerable ActiveX or Java components for execution by an end-user. The affected ActiveX and Java components do not perform sufficient input validation and, as a result, may allow an attacker to deliver arbitrary code to an affected system and execute the code with the privileges of the user's web browser session.",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation in the ActiveX and Java components used for WebLaunch functionality.",
       "vulnerabilities": [
        "Arbitrary code execution"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the user's web browser session, leading to a complete compromise of the system.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker convinces a user to visit a malicious webpage and execute vulnerable ActiveX control or Java applet.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious web page with the vulnerable ActiveX or Java components and convince the user to visit this page. The user's browser configuration may require little or no interaction to execute the malicious components as they are signed by Cisco."
