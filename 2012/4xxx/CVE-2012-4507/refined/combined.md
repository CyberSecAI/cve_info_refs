[...]  Isn't it too extreme to track such a minor issue with a CVE id? There's only limited impact (and one can tell Claws Mail to not open/display a message automatically to prevent it from crashing). It's not much more dangerous compared with the user hitting an arbitrary other programming error in Claws Mail (or other applications) that crashes it suddenly. I would think differently if it were a vulnerability that could be exploited, e.g. as explained at <http://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html#a2>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=862578#c21)  Henri Salo    2012-10-10 17:31:32 UTC  ``` A controllable null-pointer dereference is usually bad enough situation to get CVE-identifier as it breaks security boundary.  Can random person email and crash claws-mail? Does this need changing of default settings? Does this affect lot of users or only couple?  Since this is now assigned I don't think we should request reject for [CVE-2012-4507](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4507) as this issue in my opinion (by reading this page. not testing code) goes to sector "security issue".  What I think we should do is: 1. Change priority and severity of this case accordingly 2. Add comment to changelog with CVE in the patch  Please contact me if you need help with this issue and I can try my best :)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=862578#c22)  Jérôme Benoit    2012-10-10 19:38:53 UTC  ``` It affect all claws-mail users with no special configuration tunables set.  It happen not only when you want to view a message, it can happen before the delivery to MH(s) folder when the email content processing code do something (and in a MUA, the content processing code can be invoked very often : viewing, filtering).   Plus, NULL pointer dereference have some exploits pattern (hard one, but not impossible one).   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=862578#c23)  Fedora Update System    2012-10-22 22:34:32 UTC  ``` claws-mail-3.8.1-3.fc18 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 18. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/claws-mail-3.8.1-3.fc18>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=862578#c24)  Fedora Update System    2012-10-22 22:34:43 UTC  ``` claws-mail-3.8.1-3.fc17 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 17. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/claws-mail-3.8.1-3.fc17>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=862578#c25)  Fedora Update System    2012-10-22 22:34:57 UTC  ``` claws-mail-3.8.1-3.fc16 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 16. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/claws-mail-3.8.1-3.fc16>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=862578#c26)  Fedora Update System    2012-10-23 06:44:45 UTC  ``` Package claws-mail-3.8.1-3.fc18: * should fix your issue, * was pushed to the Fedora 18 testing repository, * should be available at your local mirror within two days.
