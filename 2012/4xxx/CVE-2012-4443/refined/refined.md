Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Monkey webserver retains root privileges (RUID/RGID) even when executing CGI scripts. It does not drop these privileges before executing CGI scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper privilege dropping: The server fails to drop root privileges before executing CGI scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local root access: Any user with write access to a cgi-bin directory can gain root privileges by placing malicious CGI scripts in the directory.
- Remote root access: In combination with a CGI/PHP script that has any remote code execution bug, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code as root.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: A local user with write access to a cgi-bin directory can place malicious CGI scripts.
- Remote attack: A remote attacker can exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in a CGI/PHP script served by the Monkey server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local attacker: Requires write access to a cgi-bin directory on the server.
- Remote attacker: Requires the ability to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in a CGI/PHP script handled by the server.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by John Lightsey.
- The affected Debian version was 0.9.3-1.
- The issue was assigned CVE-2012-4443.
- The package `monkey` was removed from the Debian archive due to this and other issues (buggy, unmaintained, outdated).
