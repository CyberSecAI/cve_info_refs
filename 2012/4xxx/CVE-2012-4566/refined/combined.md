Subject: CVE request: radsecproxy incorrect x.509 certificate validation

Hi,

Ralf Paffrath discovered that radsecproxy may incorrectly accept a client
certificate if the certificates chain was validated with the CA settings of
one configuration block but the other certificate constraints failed, and the
certificate constraints of another configuration block passed (ignoring this
other config block's CA settings.)

This issue has been fixed in version 1.6.1. However, it introduces a minor
regression as it ignores some configuration blocks (see the references for
further details.)

Could a CVE id be assigned?

Thanks in advance.

### Description

Config:

    client wontmatch {

        host 0.0.0.0

        type tls

        tls demoCA

        certificatenamecheck off

        matchCertificateAttribute CN:/^nonexistent$/

    }

    client demo {

        host 0.0.0.0

        type tls

        tls someotherCA

        certificatenamecheck off

        matchCertificateAttribute CN:/^cli.\*$/

    }

Given the above configuration, a client presenting a demoCA cert with

CN=cli1 will be accepted. This is incorrect.

The reason is that the CA specified in the first matching client block

is the one being used for cert chain verification and once that's

done, verification based on certificate \_contents\_ is being performed

without regarding any other CA constraints in other client blocks.

The propsed fix for this is to stop considering client blocks with a

CA config (the 'tls' option) not identical to the first matching

client block.

This may make Radsecproxy reject clients that are currently

(erroneously) being accepted. The proposed solution for scenarios

which can no longer be realised by a single Radsecproxy instance is,

for now, to run multiple instances on separate addresses or ports.

Correct, different versions = different CVEs typically. Please use

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2573-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                             Luciano Bello

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : radsecproxy
Vulnerability  : SSL certificate verification weakness
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4523 CVE-2012-4566

Ralf Paffrath reported that Radsecproxy, a RADIUS protocol proxy, mixed up
pre- and post-handshake verification of clients. This vulnerability may
wrongly accept clients without checking their certificate chain under
certain configurations.

Raphael Geissert spotted that the fix for CVE-2012-4523 was incomplete,
giving origin to CVE-2012-4566. Both vulnerabilities are fixed with this
update.

Notice that this fix may make Radsecproxy reject some clients that are
currently (erroneously) being accepted.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your radsecproxy packages.
