Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-4886:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stack Buffer Overflow
*   **Affected Software:** WPS Office, specifically the `wpsio.dll` module.
*   **Root Cause:** A BSTR string from a file is copied to a stack buffer in `wpsio.dll` without proper length validation. This allows an attacker to write beyond the buffer's boundaries.
*   **Vulnerability Details:**
    *   The vulnerability occurs in the `sub_45E2CC84` function within `wpsio.dll`.
    *   A `memcpy` operation copies data from a file (poc.wps, offset 0x41d7) into a stack buffer (`var_210`, size 0x200 bytes).
    *   The code retrieves a string length but doesn't adequately check if the string will fit in the buffer. The code adds the length to itself `add eax, eax`. This resulting value is used as the size parameter for `memcpy`.
    *   A second `memcpy` copies the same string again after the first, further overflowing the buffer by 0x2e0 bytes.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious `.wps` file containing an overly long BSTR string.
    2.  When WPS Office opens the crafted file, the vulnerable code in `wpsio.dll` attempts to copy the string into the stack buffer.
    3.  Due to the missing length validation, the `memcpy` operation overflows the buffer, overwriting the return address and/or SEH record on the stack.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The stack buffer overflow can overwrite the SEH record or return address, allowing the attacker to control the execution flow (EIP).
    *   Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   The provided crash info shows an access violation, indicating a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious .wps file to the victim.
*   **Affected Version:** WPS2012.12012.exe
*   **File version of wpsio.dll:** 8.1.0.3238
