{
  "CVE-2012-4446": {
    "Root cause": "The Apache Qpid daemon (qpidd) incorrectly treated AMQP connections with the 'federation_tag' attribute set as broker-to-broker connections instead of client-to-server connections.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Incorrect handling of AMQP connection attributes"
    ],
    "Impact": "A client could bypass authentication and impersonate any user by setting the federation_tag attribute. In Condor environments, this allows users to submit jobs as any user (except root).",
    "Attack vectors": "Establishing an AMQP connection with a broker and setting the federation_tag attribute.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to establish an AMQP connection with the broker. Any authentication method including SASL ANONYMOUS would work. "
  },
  "CVE-2012-4458": {
    "Root cause": "The AMQP type decoder in qpidd allowed arbitrary data types in certain messages, specifically in the 'client-properties' map in a connection.start-ok message.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Denial of service vulnerability due to uncontrolled resource consumption",
        "Lack of proper input validation"
      ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could send a crafted message with excessively large amounts of data, causing qpidd to allocate excessive memory, which results in an out-of-memory denial-of-service condition.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted AMQP message with an overly large array of zero-width types in the client-properties map during connection establishment.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Qpid broker and send a malicious AMQP message."
   },
  "CVE-2012-4459": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the qpid::framing::Buffer::checkAvailable() function. The position + count calculation could result in a wraparound due to integer overflow, causing the check to be bypassed.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to out-of-bounds read.",
      "Lack of sufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker could send a crafted message that exploits the integer overflow, leading to a crash due to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted message to Qpid to trigger the integer overflow in the `checkAvailable()` function during the processing of a message.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send messages to the Qpid broker without authentication."
