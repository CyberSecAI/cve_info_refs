| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-23 22:08:23 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered that setting the federation_tag attribute in an AMQP connection would turn the connection into a broker-to-broker connection, rather than a client-to-server connection.  Because of this, incoming user IDs are not checked, so if a client were to set the federation_tag attribute when establishing a regular AMQP connection, Qpid would no longer check the user ID on AMQP messages submitted by the client.  The client can then supply any value and thus impersonate any user, since AMQP messages carry user information that identify the sender and message recipients, which use user names for authentication purposes.  The client does have to authenticate, but any authentication method, including SASL ANONYMOUS would work.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c3)  Ted Ross    2012-08-24 18:57:58 UTC  ``` I claim that this is not actually a flaw but a useful feature.  The behavior (as described above) is that a connection may be considered by the broker as a "federation link" as opposed to a client connection.  Federation links are permitted to proxy the authenticated-id in messages.  This is important as federated links carry messages from many other connections, each of which may be associated with different authenticated user ids.  In a federated environment, the ingress broker for a particular message is responsible for authenticating the user-id field in the message.  For proper security, there must then be established a chain of trust between interconnected brokers such that a downstream broker trusts the upstream broker to have done (or proxied) proper authentication.  The chain of trust is established by using an ACL policy to control access to the "auth-proxy" capability.  In other words, when a broker establishes a connection to another broker, the connecting broker must authenticate with an identity that has the right to create a proxying link.  A malicious attacker with a modified client that attempts to spoof a federation link must be able to authenticate as a trusted upstream broker.  It is actually a feature to be able to create proxying connections as a regular client (i.e. by providing the federation tag).  It may be desirable for a client (e.g. a web server) to proxy multiple user ids over a single connection.  Such a policy can be created as follows:    group proxies <id1> <id2> ...    acl allow    proxies create link   acl deny-log all     create link   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c4)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-24 21:19:42 UTC  ``` But from my understanding, this is not the case.  A client can connect to the broker as a federation link, rather than as a client, with no authentication and no restriction whatsoever.  I understand the need for federated links between brokers, but when Joe User can connect to the broker without authentication and execute jobs as any user, surely that means there needs to be something to restrict these federated links from being established (perhaps there is a policy on the broker already that says "accept only federated links from IP X" or something)?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c5)  Ted Ross    2012-08-27 14:11:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c4)) > But from my understanding, this is not the case.  A client can connect to > the broker as a federation link, rather than as a client, with no > authentication and no restriction whatsoever.  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c3) describes how to place a restriction on which users can create federation links.  >  > I understand the need for federated links between brokers, but when Joe User > can connect to the broker without authentication and execute jobs as any > user, surely that means there needs to be something to restrict these > federated links from being established (perhaps there is a policy on the > broker already that says "accept only federated links from IP X" or > something)?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c6)  Florian Weimer    2012-08-29 07:51:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 607797](attachment.cgi?id=607797&action=diff "qpid-fedlink-acl.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=607797&action=edit "qpid-fedlink-acl.patch") qpid-fedlink-acl.patch  This patch treats a missing ACL as a denial for federation links.  After this patch, users must configure an ACL which specify users which are permitted to establish federation links.  Curiously, the current behavior is alluded to in the manual, which suggests to prevent guest users from creating federation links:  """ Do not allow guest to access and log QMF management methods that could cause security breaches:  group allUsers guest@QPID .... acl deny-log allUsers create link acl deny-log allUsers access method name=connect acl deny-log allUsers access method name=echo acl allow all all """  <<http://qpid.apache.org/books/trunk/AMQP-Messaging-Broker-CPP-Book/html/chap-Messaging_User_Guide-Security.html#sect-Messaging_User_Guide-Authorization-Specifying_ACL_Permissions>>  However, this requirement is not reflected in our own manuals which describe how to configure authentication for products which use qpid-cpp-server.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c7)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-21 04:30:30 UTC  ``` Does the above mean that this is just a configuration issue (i.e. should we have the configuration set to default deny rather than default allow, more or less aligning the config with what our docs indicate)?  And if that is the case, does this patch just enforce a default deny (so that a default deny config isn't required)?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c8)  Florian Weimer    2012-09-21 11:50:30 UTC  ``` It is a configuration issue in the sense that it could be fixed with configuration (enable the ACL module, make sure that you have an ACL which does not allow link creation).  condor-qmf absolutely requires this, so we'd have to release some advisory for MRG.  (ACL usage with condor-qmf is very rare, so most installations are affected.)  It has the usual problem shared with all configuration-only security fixes: implementation in the field will be poor.  I'm also not sure if denying link creation is sufficient.  What happens if a user requests routing messages to a remote broker?  Would this expose messages the user would not otherwise have access to?  I can't find any separate ACL checks for route creation.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c9)  Ted Ross    2012-09-21 12:44:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c8))  > I'm also not sure if denying link creation is sufficient.  What happens if a > user requests routing messages to a remote broker?  Would this expose > messages the user would not otherwise have access to?  I can't find any > separate ACL checks for route creation.  Denying link creation is sufficient.  Routes are dependent on federation link creation.  If there are no federation links, there will be no operational routes.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c10)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-24 21:42:37 UTC  ``` I'm of the opinion that a hard-coded default is probably the best bet, from a security perspective.  I don't know, however, if it is best from an operational perspective (Matt or Ted would have to weigh in on that).  Based on the above comment, we could have ACLs/hard-coded default to deny link creation and that would solve the problem.  I guess the implementation of how to do that is the next question.  I'm giving this the name [CVE-2012-4446](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4446) as this is a flaw we will want to correct.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c11)  Florian Weimer    2012-09-26 15:15:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c9)) > Routes are dependent on federation link creation.  If there are no > federation links, there will be no operational routes.  What about push routes added with "qpid-route add route -s"?  The target broker would have to perform the check, and it could be under the control of the attacker.  This would not enable message spoofing, but could perhaps be used to get access to exchanges/queues to which the user would not normally have access to.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c12)  Matthew Farrellee    2012-09-26 16:03:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c10)) > I'm of the opinion that a hard-coded default is probably the best bet, from > a security perspective.

I'm pro hard-coded default deny, or an extensible configuration mechanism so we can deny without editing RPM owned /etc/qpidd.conf.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c13)  Justin Ross    2012-10-01 15:34:07 UTC  ``` A comment from Chuck Rolke (who can't access the BZ):  Broker ACL already has a fastpath detection flag for which it scans the ACL file for PUBLISH EXCHANGE rules. The flag represents the presence of a publish exchange rule.  I propose adding another flag that reflects the presence of CREATE LINK rules. This flag is tested in code just before the ACL authorize lookup. In pseudo code:  function brokerCreateLink()   if (aclLoaded)     if (acl->createLinkFlag)       if (acl->authorise(user, create, link, properties))         <create link allowed>       else         <create link denied - not authorized>       endif     else       <create link denied - acl did not specify a create link rule>     endif   else     <create link denied - acl module not loaded>   endif end function  Using release notes and decent log messages users whose link creation fails will be able to figure out what to do.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c15)  Justin Ross    2012-11-05 18:38:04 UTC  ``` Chuck, please evaluate Florian's patch and also address this question:  (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c11)) > (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c9)) > > Routes are dependent on federation link creation.

Our plan, once we have the go-ahead, is to introduce the hard-coded default on qpid trunk.  A shorter-term fix, one that introduces a default-shipped acl.conf, is being developed for downstream releases in the mean time.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c22)  Murray McAllister    2013-02-26 07:49:59 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-06 18:50:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2013:0562 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0562.html>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-06 18:51:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2013:0561 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0561.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c25)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 22:11:42 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4631>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c26)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 22:13:11 UTC  ``` Created qpid-cpp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 918804](show_bug.cgi?id=918804 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-4446 CVE-2012-4458 CVE-2012-4459 qpid-cpp various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

#### Description

This issue addresses CVE-2012-4446

Federated interbroker links may be opened by client programs and not just by brokers. By default the creation of these links is not protected any formal authorization.

Users concerned about this issue may immediately lock their systems down by creating ACL rules that allow links to be created only by authorized users. For instance the following ACL rules on each broker would provide the lockdown necessary:

group proxies <id1> <id2> ...

acl allow proxies create link

acl deny-log all create link

A better solution is for the ACL module to deny the creation of links unless ACL rules are specified to specifically allow them.

In pseudo code the solution is in two parts. Part one observes CREATE LINK rules in the acl file. Part two authorizes link creation only if ACL is loaded, CREATE LINK ACL rules are specified, and the specific user is authorized to create the link in question:

function readAclFile()

...

if (CREATE LINK rules are specified)

set acl->createLinkFlag

endif

...

end function

function brokerCreateLink()

if (aclLoaded)

if (acl->createLinkFlag)

if (acl->authorise(user, create, link, properties))

<create link allowed>

else

<create link denied - not authorized>

endif

else

<create link denied - acl did not specify a create link rule>

endif

else

<create link denied - acl module not loaded>

endif

end function

This Jira will track the implementation of this restriction.

This parameter is used to specify a file which contains the private key used to sign the certificate that identifies the tool's user with the broker. The bug was due to a coding problem that caused the QPID tool to ignore the value supplied to the '--ssl-key' parameter. Consequence The broker against which the tool was run would not be able to authenticate the user of the tool. This would cause the broker to reject the connection attempt, and the tool's operation would fail. Fix The code was corrected to use the value passed via the '--ssl-key' parameter when providing authentication criteria to the broker. Result The tool's user is authenticated by the broker, and the QPID tool's operation is permitted. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2013-03-06 18:53:16 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=895535#c0)  Petr Matousek    2013-01-15 13:34:56 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The certificate file (passed with 'ssl_certfile' connection option) may contain the private key. In some cases, you can store the private key separate from the certificate. In that case, you'd have to also specify 'ssl_key' connection option and pass the separate keyfile.  Providing the keyfile separately from the certificate file is not working, please see Steps to Reproduce and Additional info below.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): python-qpid-0.18-4.el5 qpid-tools-0.18-7.el5  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Setup SSL broker requiring client authentication 2. Export client's certificate from the nss db in PEM format (use -nokeys option of openssl pkcs12) 3. Export client's private key from the nss db in PEM format (use -nocerts option of openssl pkcs12) 4. Try to connects with python client (ie. qpid-stat), provide the file exported in step2 to  '--ssl-certificate' option and the file exported in step3 to '--ssl-key' option 5. Failed: ConnectError - SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file error    Actual results: Providing the keyfile separately from the certificate file is not working.  Expected results: Providing the keyfile separately from the certificate file is working as expected.

The underlying python SSL libraries have changed between the two.  -K   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=895535#c2)  Petr Matousek    2013-01-15 13:48:14 UTC  ``` No, the behaviour is the same on both RHEL 5 and RHEL 6.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=895535#c3)  Ken Giusti    2013-01-29 14:59:32 UTC  ``` I think I've found a simple coding error that is the cause of this bug:  The qpid tools are based on the qpid python client library.  This library exports a Connection object that the tools use to connect to the broker.  This connection object is supplied all SSL related configuration parameters for the connection.  Those tools which accept the separate SSL keyfile parameter are passing it in the wrong argument to Connection.  Connection accepts this argument using the name "ssl_keyfile".  The tools are incorrectly providing this parameter using the name "ssl_key".  Thus the connection never "sees" the keyfile.  A "grep" of "ssl_*" in qpid/tools:   find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -e grep -n -i "ssl_" ./src/py/qpid-route:141:    if opts.ssl_certificate: ./src/py/qpid-route:142:        config._conn_options['ssl_certfile'] = opts.ssl_certificate ./src/py/qpid-cluster:298:        if opts.ssl_certificate: ./src/py/qpid-cluster:299:            conn_options['ssl_certfile'] = opts.ssl_certificate ./src/py/qpid-tool:180:    self.broker = self.session.addBroker(self.url, ssl_certfile=cert) ./src/py/qpid-printevents:150:  if options.ssl_certificate: ./src/py/qpid-printevents:151:    conn_options['ssl_certfile'] = options.ssl_certificate ./src/py/qpid-printevents:152:  if options.ssl_key: ./src/py/qpid-printevents:153:    conn_options['ssl_key'] = options.ssl_key ./src/py/qpid-config:318:    if opts.ssl_certificate: ./src/py/qpid-config:319:        conn_options['ssl_certfile'] = opts.ssl_certificate ./src/py/qpid-config:320:    if opts.ssl_key: ./src/py/qpid-config:321:        conn_options['ssl_key'] = opts.ssl_key ./src/py/qpid-stat:108:    if opts.ssl_certificate: ./src/py/qpid-stat:109:        conn_options['ssl_certfile'] = opts.ssl_certificate ./src/py/qpid-stat:110:    if opts.ssl_key: ./src/py/qpid-stat:111:        conn_options['ssl_key'] = opts.ssl_key ./src/py/qpid-queue-stats:136:  if options.ssl_certificate: ./src/py/qpid-queue-stats:137:    conn_options['ssl_certfile'] = options.ssl_certificate ./src/py/qpid-ha:61:        if opts.ssl_certificate: ./src/py/qpid-ha:62:            conn_options['ssl_certfile'] = opts.ssl_certificate ./src/py/qpid-ha:63:        if opts.ssl_key: ./src/py/qpid-ha:64:            conn_options['ssl_key'] = opts.ssl_key  Note the use of 'ssl_key' as the options name - that should be 'ssl_keyfile'.  Not to mention the tools that don't even allow the keyfile to be specified - that's an additional problem.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=895535#c4)  Petr Matousek    2013-01-29 17:01:39 UTC  ``` Confirmed, when the client private key is provided to the Connection object separately using 'ssl_keyfile' argument instead of 'ssl_key' (as qpid-tools do), the connection is successful (the argument works as expected).  -> Changing component to qpid-tools.  I also believe that fix for this issue is easy and may be provided with 2.3 release, thus adding 2.3.0? and blocker?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=895535#c5)  Petr Matousek    2013-01-29 17:34:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=895535#c3)) > Not to mention the tools that don't even allow the keyfile to be specified - > that's an additional problem.

However all the qpid-tools were changed to support the correct connection option ('ssl_keyfile' instead of 'ssl_key'). It solves the issue on for qpid-config and qpid-stat.   The ssl-key option is still not working properly for the following management tools: qpid-route qpid-cluster qpid-queue-stats  * Note qpid-tool still do not support '--ssl-key' option, please see [Bug 895515](show_bug.cgi?id=895515 "CLOSED ERRATA - '--ssl-key' option missing in several management tools") for details.  I believe that this issue is caused by the fact that qpid-stat and qpid-config pass the ssl options to the connection object, ie. Connection.establish(self.url, **conn_options), this is working fine.  But when the options are passed to another object (what the other qpid-tools do), ie.: BrokerManager the options do not work.  How the qpid-tools pass the connection options:  /usr/bin/qmf-tool     self.connection = cqpid.Connection(self.url, **self.conn_options) /usr/bin/qpid-cluster     def __init__(self, config, conn_options):         self.broker = self.qmf.addBroker(brokerUrl, self.config._connTimeout, **self.conn_options)         bm = BrokerManager(config, conn_options) /usr/bin/qpid-cluster-store /usr/bin/qpid-config         self.conn = Connection.establish(self.url, **conn_options) /usr/bin/qpid-printevents         er = EventReceiver(printer, host, conn_options) /usr/bin/qpid-queue-stats   def __init__(self, host, conn_options):     self.broker  = self.session.addBroker(self.url, **conn_options)   bm = BrokerManager(host, conn_options) /usr/bin/qpid-route         self.broker = self.qmf.addBroker(localBroker, config._connTimeout, **config._conn_options) /usr/bin/qpid-stat         self.connection = Connection.establish(self.url, **conn_options)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=895535#c10)  Petr Matousek    2013-02-08 14:27:03 UTC  ``` test transcript:  <snip> qpid-config: CMD: qpid-config -b amqps://127.0.0.1:6667 --ssl-certificate guest_cert --ssl-key=guest_pkey Total Exchanges: 8           topic: 3         headers: 1          fanout: 1          direct: 3     Total Queues: 6         durable: 0     non-durable: 6 PASS qpid-stat: CMD: qpid-stat -q -b amqps://127.0.0.1:6667 --ssl-certificate guest_cert --ssl-key=guest_pkey Queues   queue                                     dur  autoDel  excl  msg   msgIn  msgOut  bytes  bytesIn  bytesOut  cons  bind   =========================================================================================================================   c22f2063-3c8e-4d47-af91-125131b1b35b:0.0       Y        Y        0     0      0       0      0        0         1     2   qpid-perftest0                                                   0    10     10       0   10.2k    10.2k        0     1   qpid-perftest_pub_done                                           0     1      1       0     16       16         0     1   qpid-perftest_pub_start                                          0     1      1       0      5        5         0     1   qpid-perftest_sub_done                                           0     1      1       0     17       17         0     1   qpid-perftest_sub_ready                                          0     1      1       0      5        5         0     1 PASS qpid-route: CMD: qpid-route route map amqps://127.0.0.1:6667 --ssl-certificate guest_cert --ssl-key=guest_pkey Failed: sslerror - SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file error FAIL qpid-cluster: CMD: qpid-cluster amqps://127.0.0.1:6667 --ssl-certificate guest_cert --ssl-key=guest_pkey Failed: sslerror - SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file error FAIL qpid-queue-stats: FAIL Queue Name                                     Sec       Depth     Enq Rate     Deq Rate ======================================================================================== *** Error: Exception during connection setup: sslerror - SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file error, retrying... qpid-printevents: PASS Fri Feb  8 10:41:10 2013 NOTIC qpid-printevents:brokerConnected broker=amqps://127.0.0.1:6667 Fri Feb  8 10:41:10 2013 org.apache.qpid.broker:bind exName=qmf.default.topic args={} qName=b313824d-1c21-6440-9cff-076c3caf8502:0.0 user=anonymous@QPID key=agent.ind.event.*.*.*.# rhost=127.0.0.1:6667-127.0.0.1:54273 </snip>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=895535#c19)  Petr Matousek    2013-02-14 14:55:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been fixed.

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0562)

## Topic

Updated Messaging component packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2.3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
vendors. MRG Messaging includes an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker; AMQP 0-10
client libraries for C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence
libraries and management tools.

It was found that the Apache Qpid daemon (qpidd) treated AMQP connections
with the federation\_tag attribute set as a broker-to-broker connection,
rather than a client-to-server connection. This resulted in the source user
ID of messages not being checked. A client that can establish an AMQP
connection with the broker could use this flaw to bypass intended
authentication. For Condor users, if condor-aviary is installed, this flaw
could be used to submit jobs that would run as any user (except root, as
Condor does not run jobs as root). (CVE-2012-4446)

It was found that the AMQP type decoder in qpidd allowed arbitrary data
types in certain messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
message containing an excessively large amount of data, causing qpidd to
allocate a large amount of memory. qpidd would then be killed by the Out of
Memory killer (denial of service). (CVE-2012-4458)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to an out-of-bounds read, was found in
the Qpid qpid::framing::Buffer::checkAvailable() function. An
unauthenticated, remote attacker could send a specially-crafted message to
Qpid, causing it to crash. (CVE-2012-4459)

The CVE-2012-4446, CVE-2012-4458, and CVE-2012-4459 issues were discovered
by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds enhancements. Documentation
for these changes will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
document linked to in the References section.

All users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are
advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues,
and fix the bugs and add the enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise
MRG 2 Technical Notes. After installing the updated packages, stop the
cluster by either running "service qpidd stop" on all nodes, or
"qpid-cluster --all-stop" on any one of the cluster nodes. Once stopped,
restart the cluster with "service qpidd start" on all nodes for the update
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-23 22:08:23 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered that setting the federation_tag attribute in an AMQP connection would turn the connection into a broker-to-broker connection, rather than a client-to-server connection.  Because of this, incoming user IDs are not checked, so if a client were to set the federation_tag attribute when establishing a regular AMQP connection, Qpid would no longer check the user ID on AMQP messages submitted by the client.  The client can then supply any value and thus impersonate any user, since AMQP messages carry user information that identify the sender and message recipients, which use user names for authentication purposes.  The client does have to authenticate, but any authentication method, including SASL ANONYMOUS would work.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c3)  Ted Ross    2012-08-24 18:57:58 UTC  ``` I claim that this is not actually a flaw but a useful feature.  The behavior (as described above) is that a connection may be considered by the broker as a "federation link" as opposed to a client connection.  Federation links are permitted to proxy the authenticated-id in messages.  This is important as federated links carry messages from many other connections, each of which may be associated with different authenticated user ids.  In a federated environment, the ingress broker for a particular message is responsible for authenticating the user-id field in the message.  For proper security, there must then be established a chain of trust between interconnected brokers such that a downstream broker trusts the upstream broker to have done (or proxied) proper authentication.  The chain of trust is established by using an ACL policy to control access to the "auth-proxy" capability.  In other words, when a broker establishes a connection to another broker, the connecting broker must authenticate with an identity that has the right to create a proxying link.  A malicious attacker with a modified client that attempts to spoof a federation link must be able to authenticate as a trusted upstream broker.  It is actually a feature to be able to create proxying connections as a regular client (i.e. by providing the federation tag).  It may be desirable for a client (e.g. a web server) to proxy multiple user ids over a single connection.  Such a policy can be created as follows:    group proxies <id1> <id2> ...    acl allow    proxies create link   acl deny-log all     create link   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c4)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-24 21:19:42 UTC  ``` But from my understanding, this is not the case.  A client can connect to the broker as a federation link, rather than as a client, with no authentication and no restriction whatsoever.  I understand the need for federated links between brokers, but when Joe User can connect to the broker without authentication and execute jobs as any user, surely that means there needs to be something to restrict these federated links from being established (perhaps there is a policy on the broker already that says "accept only federated links from IP X" or something)?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c5)  Ted Ross    2012-08-27 14:11:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c4)) > But from my understanding, this is not the case.

[Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c3) describes how to place a restriction on which users can create federation links.  >  > I understand the need for federated links between brokers, but when Joe User > can connect to the broker without authentication and execute jobs as any > user, surely that means there needs to be something to restrict these > federated links from being established (perhaps there is a policy on the > broker already that says "accept only federated links from IP X" or > something)?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c6)  Florian Weimer    2012-08-29 07:51:10 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 607797](attachment.cgi?id=607797&action=diff "qpid-fedlink-acl.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=607797&action=edit "qpid-fedlink-acl.patch") qpid-fedlink-acl.patch  This patch treats a missing ACL as a denial for federation links.  After this patch, users must configure an ACL which specify users which are permitted to establish federation links.  Curiously, the current behavior is alluded to in the manual, which suggests to prevent guest users from creating federation links:  """ Do not allow guest to access and log QMF management methods that could cause security breaches:  group allUsers guest@QPID .... acl deny-log allUsers create link acl deny-log allUsers access method name=connect acl deny-log allUsers access method name=echo acl allow all all """  <<http://qpid.apache.org/books/trunk/AMQP-Messaging-Broker-CPP-Book/html/chap-Messaging_User_Guide-Security.html#sect-Messaging_User_Guide-Authorization-Specifying_ACL_Permissions>>  However, this requirement is not reflected in our own manuals which describe how to configure authentication for products which use qpid-cpp-server.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c7)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-21 04:30:30 UTC  ``` Does the above mean that this is just a configuration issue (i.e. should we have the configuration set to default deny rather than default allow, more or less aligning the config with what our docs indicate)?  And if that is the case, does this patch just enforce a default deny (so that a default deny config isn't required)?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c8)  Florian Weimer    2012-09-21 11:50:30 UTC  ``` It is a configuration issue in the sense that it could be fixed with configuration (enable the ACL module, make sure that you have an ACL which does not allow link creation).  condor-qmf absolutely requires this, so we'd have to release some advisory for MRG.  (ACL usage with condor-qmf is very rare, so most installations are affected.)  It has the usual problem shared with all configuration-only security fixes: implementation in the field will be poor.  I'm also not sure if denying link creation is sufficient.  What happens if a user requests routing messages to a remote broker?  Would this expose messages the user would not otherwise have access to?  I can't find any separate ACL checks for route creation.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c9)  Ted Ross    2012-09-21 12:44:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c8))  > I'm also not sure if denying link creation is sufficient.

If there are no federation links, there will be no operational routes.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c10)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-24 21:42:37 UTC  ``` I'm of the opinion that a hard-coded default is probably the best bet, from a security perspective.  I don't know, however, if it is best from an operational perspective (Matt or Ted would have to weigh in on that).  Based on the above comment, we could have ACLs/hard-coded default to deny link creation and that would solve the problem.  I guess the implementation of how to do that is the next question.  I'm giving this the name [CVE-2012-4446](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4446) as this is a flaw we will want to correct.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c11)  Florian Weimer    2012-09-26 15:15:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c9)) > Routes are dependent on federation link creation.

The target broker would have to perform the check, and it could be under the control of the attacker.  This would not enable message spoofing, but could perhaps be used to get access to exchanges/queues to which the user would not normally have access to.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c12)  Matthew Farrellee    2012-09-26 16:03:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c10)) > I'm of the opinion that a hard-coded default is probably the best bet, from > a security perspective.

The flag represents the presence of a publish exchange rule.  I propose adding another flag that reflects the presence of CREATE LINK rules. This flag is tested in code just before the ACL authorize lookup. In pseudo code:  function brokerCreateLink()   if (aclLoaded)     if (acl->createLinkFlag)       if (acl->authorise(user, create, link, properties))         <create link allowed>       else         <create link denied - not authorized>       endif     else       <create link denied - acl did not specify a create link rule>     endif   else     <create link denied - acl module not loaded>   endif end function  Using release notes and decent log messages users whose link creation fails will be able to figure out what to do.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c15)  Justin Ross    2012-11-05 18:38:04 UTC  ``` Chuck, please evaluate Florian's patch and also address this question:  (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c11)) > (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c9)) > > Routes are dependent on federation link creation.

Our plan, once we have the go-ahead, is to introduce the hard-coded default on qpid trunk.  A shorter-term fix, one that introduces a default-shipped acl.conf, is being developed for downstream releases in the mean time.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c22)  Murray McAllister    2013-02-26 07:49:59 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-06 18:50:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2013:0562 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0562.html>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-06 18:51:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2013:0561 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0561.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c25)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 22:11:42 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4631>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=851355#c26)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 22:13:11 UTC  ``` Created qpid-cpp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 918804](show_bug.cgi?id=918804 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-4446 CVE-2012-4458 CVE-2012-4459 qpid-cpp various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Moderate: Red Hat Enterprise MRG Messaging 2.3 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0561)

## Topic

Updated Messaging component packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2.3 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
vendors. MRG Messaging includes an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker; AMQP 0-10
client libraries for C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence
libraries and management tools.

It was found that the Apache Qpid daemon (qpidd) treated AMQP connections
with the federation\_tag attribute set as a broker-to-broker connection,
rather than a client-to-server connection. This resulted in the source user
ID of messages not being checked. A client that can establish an AMQP
connection with the broker could use this flaw to bypass intended
authentication. For Condor users, if condor-aviary is installed, this flaw
could be used to submit jobs that would run as any user (except root, as
Condor does not run jobs as root). (CVE-2012-4446)

It was found that the AMQP type decoder in qpidd allowed arbitrary data
types in certain messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a
message containing an excessively large amount of data, causing qpidd to
allocate a large amount of memory. qpidd would then be killed by the Out of
Memory killer (denial of service). (CVE-2012-4458)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to an out-of-bounds read, was found in
the Qpid qpid::framing::Buffer::checkAvailable() function. An
unauthenticated, remote attacker could send a specially-crafted message to
Qpid, causing it to crash. (CVE-2012-4459)

The CVE-2012-4446, CVE-2012-4458, and CVE-2012-4459 issues were discovered
by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds enhancements. Documentation
for these changes will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
document linked to in the References section.

All users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG are
advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these issues,
and fix the bugs and add the enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise
MRG 2 Technical Notes. After installing the updated packages, stop the
cluster by either running "service qpidd stop" on all nodes, or
"qpid-cluster --all-stop" on any one of the cluster nodes. Once stopped,
restart the cluster with "service qpidd start" on all nodes for the update
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=861234#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-27 21:35:50 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the AMQP type decoder was exposed pre-authentication because it was possible to send arbitrary types in the client-properties map in a connection.start-ok message.  This is used to send an array with elements which are all of width zero and thus consume no space on the wire, but need storage after decoding by the server.  On some systems, a suitably chosen SIZE value triggers the OOM killer and terminates the server process permanently.   Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=861234#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 16:58:57 UTC  ``` This is corrected upstream:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1453031>   External References:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4629>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=861234#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-06 18:50:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2013:0562 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0562.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=861234#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-06 18:52:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2013:0561 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0561.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=861234#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 22:13:35 UTC  ``` Created qpid-cpp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 918804](show_bug.cgi?id=918804 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-4446 CVE-2012-4458 CVE-2012-4459 qpid-cpp various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=861241#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-27 21:59:48 UTC  ``` It was discovered that the qpid::framing::Buffer::checkAvailable() function could crash due to a wraparound.  The function looks like this:    void checkAvailable(uint32_t count)       { if (position + count > size) throw OutOfBounds(); }  where position + count can overflow, resulting in a value which is smaller than size.  The put*String() functions contain potential wraparounds in the argument to checkAvailable().   Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=861241#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 16:59:27 UTC  ``` This is corrected upstream:  <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1453031>   External References:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4629>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=861241#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-06 18:50:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2013:0562 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0562.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=861241#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-06 18:52:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2013:0561 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0561.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=861241#c6)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 22:13:57 UTC  ``` Created qpid-cpp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 918804](show_bug.cgi?id=918804 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-4446 CVE-2012-4458 CVE-2012-4459 qpid-cpp various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
