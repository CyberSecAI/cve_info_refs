Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-4301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the JavaFX component of the Oracle Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It's a flaw that allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions in JavaFX when processing untrusted applets, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Security Checks:** The JavaFX component lacks adequate checks on untrusted applets. This allows an attacker to elevate the privileges of the applet to gain full system access.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability can also lead to exploitable memory corruption, potentially affecting both applets and stand-alone Java applications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the Java application or applet.
- **Full System Compromise:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- **Data Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The attacker can access sensitive data, modify system files, and disrupt system operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Browser:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage hosting a compromised Java applet. This can be achieved via social engineering, or by compromising a legitimate website.
- **Java Web Start applications:** Untrusted Java Web Start applications can also be exploited to trigger this vulnerability.
- **Other Applications:** Other applications that embed a web browser (e.g., Microsoft Office or Windows Desktop Search) may be used as an attack vector by displaying a malicious webpage within their embedded browser components. Stand-alone Java applications can also be targeted, if they process untrusted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without requiring any prior authentication.
- **Malicious Applet:** The attacker needs to create or control a malicious Java applet, or supply a malicious Java archive.
- **Social Engineering or Compromised Website:** The attacker needs to lure the user into accessing the malicious applet, which can be through social engineering, or by compromising a legitimate web site.

**Additional Information:**
- This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed by the Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update in February 2013.
- The vulnerability was being actively exploited in the wild at the time of the patch release, hence the expedited release.
- The vulnerability affects a broad range of Java versions, including JavaFX 2.2.4 and earlier, as well as Java 7 Update 11 and earlier, Java 6 Update 38 and earlier.
-  US-CERT recommends disabling the Java plug-in in web browsers as a mitigation strategy, in addition to applying updates.
