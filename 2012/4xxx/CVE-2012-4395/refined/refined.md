Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `redirect_url` parameter not being properly sanitized in `index.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of sanitization of the `redirect_url` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML. This could lead to various malicious activities like:
    - Session hijacking, where an attacker can steal user's session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites, thus, conducting phishing attacks.
    - Defacing websites or displaying malicious content.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL containing a malicious payload in the `redirect_url` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes malicious JavaScript or HTML code in the `redirect_url` parameter. This URL would then need to be delivered to the victim, typically via email or other communication channels, or by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves sanitizing the `redirect_url` parameter using `strip_tags()`.
- The vulnerable code exists within the `index.php` file of the ownCloud application.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 4.0.3 of ownCloud.

In summary, CVE-2012-4395 is a reflected XSS vulnerability arising from improper handling of the `redirect_url` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary web script. The fix involves sanitizing this input.
