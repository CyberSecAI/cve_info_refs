    "related": true,
    "summary": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the .Net Framework validates permissions for objects involved with reflection.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is the result of the .Net Framework improperly validating permissions of objects involved with reflection.",
    "vulnerabilities": [

Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web browsing scenario: An attacker could host a specially crafted website containing a malicious XBAP (XAML browser application).",
      "Windows .NET applications attack scenario: This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET Framework applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious website or run a malicious Windows .NET application. A man-in-the-middle attack could also be used if the attacker can redirect traffic.",
