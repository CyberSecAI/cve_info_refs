Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Moodle handles file access within blog posts. Specifically, files embedded in blog entries were being served without properly verifying the publication state of the blog post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control checks when delivering files embedded in blog posts. This allowed users to potentially access files that were intended to be private or not yet published.
*   **Missing Publication State Check:** The system failed to check the `publishstate` parameter, which determines if a blog post is public or not, before providing access to the embedded files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to files that were intended to be private or not yet published, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Unauthorized users might be able to access sensitive files linked in unpublished blog posts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited by directly accessing the files embedded in blog posts.
*   Attackers could potentially manipulate requests to bypass the intended access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know the file location to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges to exploit this flaw if they know the location of the embedded file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 2.3 to 2.3.1+, 2.2 to 2.2.4+, and 2.1 to 2.1.7+.
*   The provided commit link shows the fix for this issue.
*   The severity of the risk was classified as "Minor".
