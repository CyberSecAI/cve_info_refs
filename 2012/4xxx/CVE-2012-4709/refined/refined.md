- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the parsing of XML external entities within Invensys Wonderware InTouch HMI. Specifically, the application allows access to local resources (files and internal resources) via unsafe parsing of XML external entities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from unsafe XML parsing. Specifically, the software does not properly validate user-controlled input when processing XML files, allowing for XML external entity injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of confidentiality and availability of the Invensys Wonderware InTouch HMI. This could involve an attacker exfiltrating local or remote resource content to a server under their control and/or causing denial of service of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted XML file to a user of the vulnerable application on the local machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have access to the local machine to provide the malformed XML file, and they require low skill to exploit this vulnerability. The exploit is only triggered when a local user runs the vulnerable application and loads the malicious XML file.
