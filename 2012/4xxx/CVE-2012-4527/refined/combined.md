Subject: CVE Request -- mcrypt: stack-based buffer overflow by encryption /
 decryption of overly long file names

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Attila Bogar reported a stack-based buffer overflow
in the way MCrypt, a crypt() package and crypt(1) command
replacement, used to encrypt / decrypt files with overly
long names (longer than 128 bytes). A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted file that, when processed
by the mcrypt too, would lead to mcrypt executable crash [*].

A different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4409:
[1] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4409>

Note: Using Red Hat bugzilla record for CVE-2012-4409 since
particular Mitre record is not described yet.

References:
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=867790>

Patch proposed by Attila:
[3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=867790#c0>

Reproducer:
To reproduce let mcrypt encrypt / decrypt file with name
longer ~128 bytes.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

[*] FORTIFY_SOURCE protection mechanism would mitigate this
deficiency to result into crash only. But on systems, without
FORTIFY_SOURCE protection being applied, the impact might be
higher.

P.S.: I am not sure about relation of this issue to the issue
      Raphael Geissert reported previously:
      [4] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/10/02/1>

      so CC-in him too, he to clarify if [2] == [4], or if
      they are yet different issues. Raphael, please clarify.
      Thanks, Jan.

If a user were tricked into attempting to encrypt/decrypt specially crafted long filename(s), this flaw would cause a stack-based buffer overflow that could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.  Note that this is caught by FORTIFY_SOURCE, which renders this to being a crash-only bug on Fedora.  There are currently no upstream patches for this flaw.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): mcrypt-2.6.8-9.el6 (possibly others too).  How reproducible: Run mcrypt with ~128 byte long file names.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=867790#c1)  Attila Bogar    2012-10-18 10:01:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 629286](attachment.cgi?id=629286 "new spec") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=629286&action=edit "new spec") new spec  spec file to build fixed rpms   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=867790#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-18 13:24:43 UTC  ``` Thank you for your report, Attila.

Memory impact should be acceptable. And this allow to show the end of the error message if a file were to contain a very long name.   I believe a proper fix should be changing all the err_crit like functions to use va_args.

I think you need to be proposing this to upstream mcrypt at this point, since the 80 char workaround is sufficient to prevent the overflow.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=867790#c16)  contact\_redhat    2012-11-04 00:25:43 UTC  ``` Just my two cents:  Forget about increasing the buffer size, if you like, ok.  But is weird to have a 128 bytes buffer and use only the 80 firsts bytes. WIDTH should be 128 to match tmperr buffer.  #define WIDTH 128 char tmperr[WIDTH];  is a better patch, in the sense that it keeps a coherent length where to write compared to the buffer. It make the code reading easier.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=867790#c17)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-14 18:27:15 UTC  ``` mcrypt-2.6.8-10.el6 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 stable repository.

Subject: Re: CVE Request -- mcrypt: stack-based buffer overflow
 by encryption / decryption of overly long file names

For my own clarification - where does this long file name come from?  If
it's only provided on the command line, then I don't see how this would be
a vulnerability, since the person executing mcrypt would only be attacking
themselves.  (CVE-2012-4409 is still OK since one wouldn't expect code
execution when decrypting the contents of a file.)

Thanks,
Steve

openSUSE Security Update:
mcrypt: Fixed some sprintf buffer overflows
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2012:1440-1
Rating: low
References: #786100
Cross-References: CVE-2012-4527
Affected Products:
openSUSE 12.2
openSUSE 12.1
openSUSE 11.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
Some potential mcrypt buffer overflows in the commandline
tool were fixed, which could lead to early aborts of
mcrypt. Due to FORTIFY\_SOURCE catching such cases, it would
have only aborted mcrypt with a buffer overflow backtrace.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 12.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2012-758
- openSUSE 12.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2012-758
- openSUSE 11.4:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2012-758
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".
Package List:
- openSUSE 12.2 (i586 x86\_64):
mcrypt-2.6.8-24.9.1
mcrypt-debuginfo-2.6.8-24.9.1
mcrypt-debugsource-2.6.8-24.9.1
- openSUSE 12.1 (i586 x86\_64):
mcrypt-2.6.8-19.9.1
mcrypt-debuginfo-2.6.8-19.9.1
mcrypt-debugsource-2.6.8-19.9.1
- openSUSE 11.4 (i586 x86\_64):
mcrypt-2.6.8-24.1
mcrypt-debuginfo-2.6.8-24.1
mcrypt-debugsource-2.6.8-24.1
