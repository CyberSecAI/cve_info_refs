| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

dropdown menu can be used for URL spoofing, other evil
Firefox 10.0.1 : Navigation away from a page with
multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*
CVE-2012-3995: Out of bounds read in
IsCSSWordSpacingSpace
\*
CVE-2012-4179: Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn
\*
CVE-2012-4180: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace
\*
CVE-2012-4181: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILAnimationController::DoSample
\*
CVE-2012-4182: Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditRules::WillInsert
\*
CVE-2012-4183: Heap-use-after-free in
DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures
\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-4185: Global-buffer-overflow in
nsCharTraits::length
\*
CVE-2012-4186: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData
\*
CVE-2012-4187: Crash with ASSERTION: insPos too small
\*
CVE-2012-4188: Heap-buffer-overflow in Convolve3x3
\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-89

## defaultValue security checks not applied

Announced
October 11, 2012
Reporter
moz\_bug\_r\_a4
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 16.0.1
* Firefox ESR 10.0.9
* SeaMonkey 2.13.1
* Thunderbird 16.0.1
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.9

### Description

Mozilla security researcher **moz\_bug\_r\_a4** reported a regression where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a security check in `defaultValue()`. This can allow for improper access to the `Location` object. In versions 15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the potential for arbitrary code execution.

Security researcher **Gareth Heyes** also [blogged](http://www.thespanner.co.uk/2012/10/10/firefox-knows-what-your-friends-did-last-summer/) about a Firefox 16 only symptom that is fixed in the updated versions.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=720619#c0)• 13 years ago |
|  | |

This is a regression between Firefox 6.0.2 and Firefox 7. This seems to be a regression from [bug 646129](/show_bug.cgi?id=646129 "RESOLVED FIXED - [[DefaultValue]] on Date objects is wrong when called with no hint"). It seems that we unwrap security wrappers without doing security check in defaultValue().
Security problems:
\* It's possible to get cross-origin window's location.href. (This is related to [bug 593602](/show_bug.cgi?id=593602 "RESOLVED FIXED - Problem with Location object's principal").)
\* If a target page has custom window.valueOf/toString methods, it's possible to call those methods.
\* It's possible to call valueOf/toString methods on a COW even if valueOf/toString are not readable.

By calling enter, we do any security checks/other required setup for the wrappers. Note that because some wrappers (i.e. COWs) don't throw on invalid property accesses but simply don't return the functions, we now have to throw ourselves if they don't successfully convert the object to a primitive value.
I'm not entirely sure about the JSDVG\_IGNORE\_STACK, should it be SEARCH\_STACK?Assignee: nobody → mrbkapStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Blake: would an alternative be to override SecurityWrapper::defaultValue? It makes me wonder, in general, if SecurityWrapper is really just an unnecessary alternative to CHECKED calls in Wrapper.

This stuff is not particularly my strong suit, as evidenced by this bug existing at all. But here goes.
I'm a bit confused why this method, being outside the wrapper's compartment, doesn't just naturally hit all the barriers that prevent access to these properties and all. Is there something we could do to make that happen?

ToPrimitive doesn't necessarily just use toString; it can also use valueOf as well. So this is at least insufficient.
It seems to me that perhaps there should be a new type of action for [[DefaultValue]], and enter() implementations should reject such actions unless they were written to handle them. The hook's not a property-get, a property-set, or a call; it's really (most likely) the union of two of those, isn't it?

Same here.

Instead of doing all of the work myself, I realized that DefaultValue is generic enough that it will work on a proxy without any additional coaxing.

Not going to make Fx10 next week, but we should get this into Fx11 even if it means landing early in Beta because it doesn't get Aurora approval before the merge.

This fixes all of the testcases here. It's basically the same as v2, except more. Basically, the regular DefaultValue implementation does the right thing for us (since toString and valueOf should work through wrappers, if they're even accessible).

I didn't have time to do a full browser build to test, but I bet <http://whereswalden.com/files/temp/date.html> also doesn't pass with this patch.
I'm pretty sure I wrote a shell test (shell-only, tho, since it uses newGlobal) which would have caught this -- ecma\_5/Date/defaultvalue.js. Did you run shell tests with this patch?

Feel free to add the webpage-based Date test I linked in the previous comment as well, if you want. Although I tend to think it's not necessary given the shell tests.
Do we have any shell-available security-wrapper functionality, so that there could be a shell test as well? Since this was a JS issue, it'd be better if the test were a regular JS test, as the ability to smoketest using JS tests only, usually with few false positives, is very helpful.

Hmm, so you're testing only when there are no properties exposed? For completeness, I think you should probably test the cases where toString only is exposed, valueOf only is exposed, neither is exposed, and both are exposed.

So how about covering all the bases and exercising ToPrimitive with hint Number? "v - 0" should do the trick, I think.

So, it turns out that this change kind of sucks. It broke 2 XPConnect mochitests, because you can no longer implicitly toString() chrome objects. But you \_can\_ call toString() on them. I'm not well-versed in the ways of ES5, but it seems like we could do better here. I'm going to push to try to run the full Mochitest suite, but I'm not optimistic about the result, given that 2 XPConnect tests alone were broken (and that's usually a reasonable benchmark).
What do you think, Blake?

I think I figured out the problem with Blake's fix. Assuming that a puncture is understood to be the forwarding of a trap on a wrapper to the corresponding trap on the wrapped object, Wrapper:defaultValue does indeed perform a puncture, \*except\* when the wrapped object uses JS\_ConvertStub as its defaultValue trap. In that case, ToPrimitive falls back to the DefaultValue function, which attempts to obtain a value using the toString/valueOf methods on the object.
In other words, I think we can make this work by only calling enter/leave for the defaultValue trap if the wrapped object does \*not\* use JS\_ConvertStub as its defaultValue trap.

Ok, so obviously this isn't smart enough. The entire tree still turns orange. I'd like to know \*why\* most of the tests are failing. Are they doing something they're not supposed to be doing? Or are we disallowing something we're supposed to allow?

The problem is that XPConnect installs a custom convert hook on all objects and location objects never permit PUNCTURE access, therefore the reduced testcase should be: |location + ''| (which shouldn't throw, but will).
bholley, do you see a solution here better than simply adding a new type of security flag CONVERT, as opposed to PUNCTURE, where we can do more correct checking for location objects?

I'd like to think about a solution as well. Where and why does xpconnect does this?

Oops, clearly you're allowed to answer my question :-)
See XPC\_WN\_{Shared,Helper}\_Convert in js/xpconnect/src/XPCWrappedNativeJSOps.cpp for the gory details. Basically, there's some ugly XPConnect stuff that needs to be handled in a couple of the cases, so XPConnect always overrides it. For the string case, XPConnect simply calls ToString on the underlying object.

That seems reasonable to me, though I've never really looked at the guts of the \_Convert hooks. Maybe eddy can come up with something more clever.
Our number of wrapper Actions is also becoming somewhat unwieldy. It would be nice to refactor that stuff somehow (even just using a switch statement with a default MOZ\_ASSERT to make sure we never miss handling one). Though really, we pretty much want the same Convert policy for any filtering wrapper AFAICT...

First of all, the reason why we have a PUNCTURE action is mainly for cloning. When cloning a wrapped object, the clone algorithm needs to asking permission for a PUNCTURE, which is essentially the same as asking for permission to unwrap the wrapped object.
To my knowledge, none of the convert hooks have any side effects, so from a security point of view, our only concern is that we might leak information about a wrapped object by getting its default value. In a sense, a CONVERT action is a weaker form of PUNCTURE; it doesn't allows us to obtain the wrapped object itself, but does allow us to obtain a string representation of it.
A major subtlety, however, is that we can also obtain a string representation of a wrapped object by calling its toString/valueOf method, and this fallback approach is used by the convert trap of Wrapper when the wrapped object doesn't has a convert trap it cannot forward to (i.e JS\_ConvertStub).
So, even if we use a separate action type, like CONVERT, to govern our policy for the convert trap, if the wrapped object is another Wrapper, we should only disallow calling the convert trap if we know that it is not going to use the above fallback approach. Otherwise, we would end up disallowing something that would be allowed had we just done a GET and CALL to invoke the toString/valueOf method directly.
This is what my patch was supposed to solve, but I'm afraid the situation is even more complicated than that. If I understood Blake correctly, the presence of JS\_ConvertStub alone is sufficient, but not necessary to imply that the fallback approach will be taken. Some wrappers in XPConnect implement a custom convert trap, that nevertheless ends up calling toString/valueOf in several cases. So neither CONVERT of PUNCTURE is an appropriate action in this case, and we cannot call toString/valueOf directly either, because the convert hook might do special stuff like maintaining object maps on top of these calls.
So what we really need, in my opinion, is a way to tell whether or not the convert trap will return a value that could not have been obtained by calling toString/valueOf directly.
For instance, we could change the convert hook's signature so that it can report whether it did anything special or not. In Wrapper::defaultValue, we would then call the convert hook first, and only check if the call was allowed \*afterwards\*. If it was not, and the wrapper did something special, do not allow the result of the call to escape the wrapper. Obviously, this is only safe if the convert hook doesn't have any side effects. Mainly for this reason, Blake didn't like this approach.
Alternatively, we could leave the signature of the convert hook unchanged, and compare the result of calling the convert hook with that of calling toString/valueOf. If the results differ, \*and\* the call to the convert hook was allowed, do not allow the result of the call to escape the wrapper. Again, this is only safe if the convert hooks don't have any side effects.
Another approach might be to call the convert hook twice (or split it into two functions). The first call would allow the wrapped object to report back what approach its convert hook will take, based on its current state, but would otherwise not have any side effects.
Based on the result of the first call, we would then decide whether to do an access check for the convert hook. If the convert hook simply calls toString/valueOf + some bookkeeping, we don't have to any access checks. In all other cases, we do. The second call would then perform the actual conversion. The main drawback here is that we would have to change the signature and behavior for every convert hook.
That's all I got so far. However, Ihave to say that if it turns out that the convert trap doesn't have any side effects, this whole bug seems like massive overkill to me. XPConnect already seems to handle stuff like illegal conversions and not leaking information via its custom convert traps, so the need for a policy based access mechanism for this hook is not clear to me. Maybe I'm wrong. If that's the case, please explain to me why :-)

It seems to me that if the problem is XPConnect's use of a custom convert stub, we should fix the problem by refactoring that code so that it can tell us what it's going to do. Then, when we get the CONVERT wrapper action in XPConnect, we check for the custom XPConnect convert stub, and if so, call into the relevant code to ask what it's about to do.

And how do you propose that we refactor the convert stub so that it can tell us what it is going to do before it is going to do it? I gave a couple of suggestions, but would like to hear your thoughts on the matter.

I'm not proposing changing the signature of JS\_ConvertStub (which was my interpretation of your suggestions in [comment 40](/show_bug.cgi?id=720619#c40 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of security check for [[DefaultValue]]")). I'm saying we specifically check if the stub is XPC\_WN\_Shared\_Convert in the policy trap. If it is, then we either verify that it has no side effects, or introduce a separate helper function that will tell us when XPC\_WN\_Shared\_Convert will and will not have side-effects.

It's a terrible hack, but I don't have any better solution. In my opinion, if this were an ideal world, XPConnect shouldn't override the DefaultValue trap to begin with, so this problem wouldn't even exist. But seeing how that's not realistic, I'd say that bholley's suggestion is probably the way to go.
I can push a patch with the proposed fix to try early next week.

Did some brainstorming with bholley today, and decided to try another approach.
The latest idea is to simply always forward the convert trap to toString/valueOf for wrappers. In theory, this should work for everything except the Date object, for which we can write some special case code. This isn't very neat, since, as I understand it, the Date object is the reason we have the defaultValue trap in the first place, but if it works, its at least cleaner than the previous proposal.
Also note that that the DefaultValue algorithm calls toString/valueOf on the wrappee, not on the wrapper. Either this has to be changed, or we need to roll our own.

Well, that didn't work either. All mochitests are still orange.
The last attempt was a rather blind one. We assumed it would work, but I don't really understand why it doesn't. Understanding that might help in coming up with a solution that \*does\* work.
Almost all errors seem to be similar in nature:

bholley, blake, any ideas on how this could be caused by the changes in defaultValue introduced by my latest patch?

The idea as described in [comment 46](/show_bug.cgi?id=720619#c46 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of security check for [[DefaultValue]]") wouldn't have worked because, according to waldo, some plugins rely on custom defaultValue traps as well. Recall that our backup plan, which isn't mentioned in the comment, was to only forward the convert trap to toString/valueOf for wrappers if a PUNCTURE failed, which is what this patch intended to do.
The first two lines in defaultValue are probably redundant; they are meant to check whether calling IndirectProxyHandler::defaultValue could potentially cause a puncture. If the convert trap of the wrapped object is JS\_ConvertStub, we don't have to check if a PUNCTURE is allowed, otherwise we do.
The next few lines are used to perform the PUNCTURE. If succesful, we call IndirectProxyHandler::defaultValue after all, and proceed as we would have before. If \*not\* succesful, we fall back to calling js::DefaultValue, which never calls the convert trap: it either calls toString or valueOf to produce the value of the object, which is exactly the behavior we want.
Afaict, this is the behavior we wanted. Am I missing something obvious?

Ah! I wasn't aware that a failed PUNCTURE would cause an exception to be set at that point. I assume these are set by the implementation of enter in XPConnect? How does one clear a pending exception in SpiderMonkey?

This call is duplicated. Seems simple enough to avoid by making the enter() call conditional on the convert hook being different than JS\_ConvertStub.
We also need this code on IndirectWrapper, right? I've been thinking, do we actually have a use for IndirectWrapper in the current code? I think everybody using it could just use IndirectProxyHandler (i.e., nobody is using the policy enforcement traps). As such, maybe we should just kill it so that it's not a foot-gun with fixes like this?
Also, this needs a big comment explaining what's going on here.

Well, the leave call needs to be conditional too. So I have to either replicate the call or the check. Do you prefer the latter?
If nobody is using IndirectWrapper, we should get rid of it imho. We can always add it back again later.

I think you can add two levels of conditional and then you only need a single leave call. But either way. Make the leave() conditional, since I think we actually don't need it anymore. File a bug on ripping it and IndirectWrapper out if you get the chance? :-)

Patch to be reviewed
Per IRC discussion, I don't think it's safe to special-case JS\_ConvertStub, and this needs tests.

I find this comment a bit confusing, and think it could be simplified to:
"The most transparent behavior would be to call DefaultValue on the wrapped object. But this can involve running code on the wrappee, as well as other behavior if the object implements a custom convert stub. So we attempt a PUNCTURE. If it succeeds, we transparently forward the call to the wrappee. If not, we clear the pending exception and call DefaultValue on the wrapper, which usually just ends up invoking .toString() or .toPrimitive()."

Pass |wrapper| for these two calls.
r=bholley with those changes, and a test (this shouldn't land without a working test, even if we decide not to check it in immediately).

Ok so the good news is Blake already wrote a mochitest for this bug a while ago. The bad news is that my patch doesn't make this test green. Tracing reveals that calling the defaultValue trap on a CCW ends up in IndirectWrapper::defaultValue, after which the call to enter fails (as expected). We then fall back to calling DefaultValue on the wrapper, which \*should\* result in a call to toString. Shouldn't this trigger the exception that the test is looking for? Or is the test testing for the wrong thing?

Well, our new solution opts for various fallbacks and silent failures, right? It's possible that Blake's test was just testing for the kind of aggressive throwing behavior that we had to cut out. Trace through the call and see what ends up happening? Ultimately, we just want to make sure that the wrapper isn't circumvented. We don't so much care if it throws.

The test is now testing for the wrong thing. It assumes that it should throw because it has an empty \_\_exposedProps\_\_ (and therefore doesn't expose either toString or valueOf) but because of [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype"), we'll now pick up toString out of the content compartment. So yeah, [comment 68](/show_bug.cgi?id=720619#c68 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of security check for [[DefaultValue]]") is right on.

Let me make sure I understand you correctly: it looks to me as if the chrome test shouldn't throw anymore, since it can now pick up toString out of the content compartment. However, the content test should still throw, since it cannot access toString either (at least, thats the behavior im seeing right now with my patch applied)
If the above is correct, it looks like this patch is ready to go. I ran into one more assertion because DefaultValue was called from the wrong compartment if DirectWrapper::defaultValue is called from CrossCompartmentWrapper::defaultValue (it needs to be the compartment of the wrapper, not the wrappee). Adding a call to AutoCompartment::enter resolved that issue.

Yes. We only currently do the standard prototype remapping for chrome objects exposed to content.

Sounds reasonable, but I think such a change needs review.

To test things for chrome, try overriding Object.toString() in the chrome compartment and make sure that you see the effects when doing DefaultValue operations in the chrome scope but not in the content scope.

I'll be on vacation next week, so I wont be able to land this patch until the week after that. I've pushed the patch to try to make sure there are no more oranges. If you feel like landing it for me, by all means go ahead.

Is this patch back-portable, or does it depend on other recent changes? We'd like to make sure it's fixed on the upcoming ESR-17, and ideally on ESR-10 since that's still supported.

Not super happy about the duplication here, but I guess we'll fix that when we merge the wrapper stuff back into the ProxyHandler hierarchy.

QA is trying to verify this is fixed.
Testcase 1, 2 and 3 work as expected.
Testcase 4 we assume to be broken as per [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=720619#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of security check for [[DefaultValue]]").
Testcase 5 we can't seem to get working. It reports the same thing to error console in Firefox 17b1#1 and 17b1#2. Can we get some explanation of the testcase #5? Thank you

Yes, that's why [bug 799952](/show_bug.cgi?id=799952 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross domain access to the location object") was filed and why this has become a chemspill manner within hours.

I verified this on Linux and Mac with the test cases here.
On a 16.0 build I could see the problem using testcase 1, 2 and 3.
On a 16.0.1 candidate builds I did not see the problem.
On a build prior to the bug fix referenced in [comment #17](/show_bug.cgi?id=720619#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of security check for [[DefaultValue]]") (Fx10) I could also see the problem in testcase 4 and 5. I did not see these problems in later builds nor in the 16.0.1 candidates.
I'll check WinXP once those builds are out before marking as verified for Fx16.

Testcase 4 broke due to the fix for [bug 723808](/show_bug.cgi?id=723808 "RESOLVED FIXED - disallow inheriting of system principal in type=content docshells") in Firefox 11/10.0.3
Testcase 5 broke somewhere else along the way. In Firefox 15 I get
Error: Exposing chrome JS objects to content without \_\_exposedProps\_\_ is
insecure and deprecated.
Error: TypeError: opener.wrappedJSObject is undefined
In both cases the underlying bug is still there, it's just some particular behaviors the exploits were relying on changed.

Atleast it would allow people to backport, if 10.0.9 is going to take some time :)

Attached patch

[ESR10 Part 1 - Run the [[DefaultValue]] algorithm on the wrapper if subsumes fails (esr10). v1](attachment.cgi?id=670320&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=670320&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=720619&attachment=670320)

This is the backport of the fix landed elsewhere to ESR10. The PUNCTURE machinery
unfortunately doesn't exist there, but this was back in the day when you could still
call subsume() from the JS engine, so we can work with that. Note also that we don't
necessarily get the perfect object principals here (given that this is pre-CPG), but
they should be at least same-origin with the correct principals, so this should be ok.
bz, given that mrbkap is on PTO, I think you're the best reviewer here.

Over IRC, luke said "in that case, the esr10 patch looks good to me in my weak opinion", so I'm counting that as a review.

For posterity, the issue here is that we need to call the enter()/leave() traps when going from chrome to content so that the misnamed CrossOriginWrapper can push/pop a principal.

This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Critical: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1362)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes one security issue is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled security wrappers.
Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-4193)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges moz\_bug\_r\_a4 as the original reporter.

Note: This issue cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted HTML mail
message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages. It could be
exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the full
remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
corrects this issue. After installing the update, Thunderbird must be
restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=865215#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-11 03:45:36 UTC  ``` Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a regression where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for improper access access to the Location object and the potential for arbitrary code execution.    External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-89.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges moz_bug_r_a4 as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=865215#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-12 20:15:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1362 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1362.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=865215#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-12 20:15:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1361 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1361.html>   ``` |  |

function poc() {
var win = window.open('<https://twitter.com/lists/>', 'newWin', 'width=200,height=200');
setTimeout(function(){
alert('Hello '+/^[https:\/\/twitter.com\/([^/]+)/.exec(win.location)[1](https:///%5C/%5C/twitter.com%5C/%28%5B%5E/%5D%2B%29/.exec%28win.location%29%5B1)])
}, 5000);
}
I can't reproduce in 15 or trunk, but 16 is affected.

This doesn't involve the web console. Turn off popups and visit <http://people.mozilla.org/~khuey/test_location.html>
It's also not the same as [Bug 720619](/show_bug.cgi?id=720619 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of security check for [[DefaultValue]]") because it doesn't happen in the copy of ESR that I have, but the fix for that has not been backported to ESR yet.

Note that the comments on the linked blog also say that both
alert(document.getElementById(‘x’).contentWindow.location)
and
alert(win.location)
work.

I'll attach a minimal testcase in a sec that does not involve popups.
This regressed on trunk in the range <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=bf8f2961d0cc&tochange=4a8e0d5fc954> so presumably from [bug 754202](/show_bug.cgi?id=754202 "RESOLVED FIXED - Pull principals directly off the context/object compartment"). It then got fixed in [bug 720619](/show_bug.cgi?id=720619 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of security check for [[DefaultValue]]"), I assume.Blocks: [754202](/show_bug.cgi?id=754202 "RESOLVED FIXED - Pull principals directly off the context/object compartment")

[Positive/negative test cases for accessing cross- and same-domain location objects](attachment.cgi?id=670212)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=670212&action=edit)

As per discussion with Boris, this test fleshes out the issue a bit more and adds a few more cases not covered by simple access to the location object. Also includes some positive test cases in case we broke same-domain location object access.
All tests pass in FF15. Some break in 17.0b1 build 1 but then are all fixed in 17.0b1 build 2.
Also worth noting: try running this in Safari and Chrome. Just sayin'.

On Chrome and Opera I see "Fail: X-domain access to iframe contentWindow.location object via Object.prototype.toString.call should be disallowed"
Using Object.prototype.toString.call just returns "[Object Location]" though, so I don't think there's a security issue here in Chrome (or Opera).

This is broken. You have a CR in there after the backslash, not a newline. Please fix that.

How about:
<!DOCTYPE html>
at least? Or just name the file child\_bug799952.txt, perhaps?
>+++ b/dom/tests/mochitest/bugs/test\_bug799952.html
>+setTimeout (start, 2000);
So as a general rule, use of setTimeout in a test indicates a bug.
In this case, nothing actually ensures that after two seconds the frame has even been parsed, much less finished loading. It would be better to do:
addLoadEvent(start);
which will make sure start() runs after onload.
>+// the following are error cases. If they do not throw, they are failures.
Probably good to indent everything inside the function by two spaces.
Also, the try/catch indentation is slightly odd. Normally I think it would be:
try {
something;
} catch (e) {
whatever;
}
>+ foo = String (/(.\*)/.exec(window[0].location)[1]);
Perhaps replace window[0] with $("win").contentWindow like you have for the other tests here?
>+is ( result, "Error: Permission denied to access property \'toString\'", "Access to xdomain location via regexp must throw exception" )
Please nix the spaces around the '(' and before the ')'.
>+<iframe id="win" name="win" src="<https://example.com:443/tests/dom/tests/mochitest/bugs/child_bug799952.html>"></iframe>
You don't need a "name" attribute there.
>+<iframe id="sameDomainContent" name="sameDomainContent" src="../child\_bug799952.html"></iframe>
Likewise. And also, why the "../" bit?
r=me with the above addressed. Thank you for writing these up!

Can't this just be:

?
All the is() calls should have the third argument indented even with the first argument, not with the is() itself.
r=me with those nits picked.

Problem with referencing simply "child\_bug799952.html" is that the Mochitest test suite - for whatever reason - tries to resolve that as "test\_bug799952.html/child\_bug799952.html" which returns a 404.
Previously I used a workaround of "../" but you mentioned that wasn't kosher.
Any clues about why relative URLs are resolved like this? I'm pretty baffled. The above solution works and assures us that we have a same-domain URL, but it does feel like I'm missing something.

That's.... quite unexpected. How exactly are you running the test?

Fixed URL issue. Looks like I was adding an extra slash to the file name when I ran the test locally, causing the 404 badness. Mea culpa and thanks for having patience.

That's .... really odd. Those failures look like what I would expect if the test were running before the cross-origin iframe has loaded, but we're explicitly running it off the load event! What the heck?

|  | |

Maybe add a test that makes sure we can't read the DOM of the cross-origin iframe and push to try with that? See whether that test is also failing when the location part fails?
Alternately, perhaps log the actual location string when we get it, so we can see what page we \_think\_ we have loaded in there.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others

discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3982](/security/CVE-2012-3982), [CVE-2012-3983](/security/CVE-2012-3983), [CVE-2012-3988](/security/CVE-2012-3988), [CVE-2012-3989](/security/CVE-2012-3989),

[CVE-2012-4191](/security/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always

properly handle the  element. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.

([CVE-2012-3984](/security/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the

HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](/security/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform

security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](/security/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be

bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-3991](/security/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a

remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject

script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](/security/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that

allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-3993](/security/CVE-2012-3993), [CVE-2012-3994](/security/CVE-2012-3994), [CVE-2012-4184](/security/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in

Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker

could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context

of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3990](/security/CVE-2012-3990), [CVE-2012-3995](/security/CVE-2012-3995), [CVE-2012-4179](/security/CVE-2012-4179), [CVE-2012-4180](/security/CVE-2012-4180),

[CVE-2012-4181](/security/CVE-2012-4181), [CVE-2012-4182](/security/CVE-2012-4182), [CVE-2012-4183](/security/CVE-2012-4183), [CVE-2012-4185](/security/CVE-2012-4185), [CVE-2012-4186](/security/CVE-2012-4186),

[CVE-2012-4187](/security/CVE-2012-4187), [CVE-2012-4188](/security/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location

object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability

to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4192](/security/CVE-2012-4192), [CVE-2012-4193](/security/CVE-2012-4193))
