\* CVE Identifier: CVE-2012-4445
Summary
- -------
The internal EAP authentication server of hostapd does not sufficiently
validate the message length field of EAP-TLS messages, which can be
exploited for a denial-of-service via specially crafted EAP-TLS messages
(before authentication).
Hostapd has a function eap\_server\_tls\_process\_fragment() used by its
internal EAP authentication server for handling fragmented EAP-TLS
messages. The function (indirectly) calls wpabuf\_overflow() aborting
the application in case of potential buffer overflows. Such a situation
can be triggered by an attacker sending an EAP-TLS message with
a) the "More Fragments" flag set and
b) an "TLS Message Length" value that is smaller than the size of
the "TLS Data" field.
The vulnerability can be exploited only if hostapd is configured to use
its internal EAP authentication server, either directly for IEEE 802.11x
or when using hostapd as a RADIUS authentication server.
Affected is hostapd in versions 0.6 - 1.0. The issue was introduced with

FreeBSD-SA-12:07.hostapd Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Insufficient message length validation for EAP-TLS messages
Category: contrib
Module: wpa
Announced: 2012-11-22
Credits: Timo Warns, Jouni Malinen
Affects: FreeBSD 8.0 and later.
Corrected: 2012-11-22 22:52:15 UTC (RELENG\_8, 8.3-STABLE)
2012-11-22 22:52:15 UTC (RELENG\_8\_3, 8.3-RELEASE-p5)

CVE Name: CVE-2012-4445
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The hostapd utility is an authenticator for IEEE 802.11 networks. It
provides full support for WPA/IEEE 802.11i and can also act as an IEEE
802.1X Authenticator with a suitable backend Authentication Server
(typically FreeRADIUS).
EAP-TLS is the original, standard wireless LAN EAP authentication
protocol defined in RFC 5216. It uses PKI to secure communication to a
RADIUS authentication server or another type of authentication server.
II. Problem Description
The internal authentication server of hostapd does not sufficiently
validate the message length field of EAP-TLS messages.
III. Impact
A remote attacker could cause the hostapd daemon to abort by sending
specially crafted EAP-TLS messages, resulting in a Denial of Service.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems not running hostapd are not
vulnerable.
Note that for FreeBSD 8.x systems, the EAP-TLS authentication method
is not enabled by default. Systems running FreeBSD 8.x are only
affected when hostapd is built with -DEAP\_SERVER and as such, binary
installations from the official release are not affected.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 8-STABLE or 9-STABLE, or to
the RELENG\_8\_3, or RELENG\_9\_0 security branch dated after the
correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 8.3
and 9.0 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 8.x]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-12:07/hostapd-8.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-12:07/hostapd-8.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.x]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-12:07/hostapd.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-12:07/hostapd.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running 8.3-RELEASE, 9.0-RELEASE, 9.1-RC1, 9.1-RC2, or 9.1-RC3
on the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the
freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install

The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.

messages. The function (indirectly) calls wpabuf_overflow() aborting
the application in case of potential buffer overflows. Such a situation
can be triggered by an attacker sending an EAP-TLS message with

    a) the "More Fragments" flag set and
    b) an "TLS Message Length" value that is smaller than the size of
       the "TLS Data" field.

The vulnerability can be exploited only if hostapd is configured to use
its internal EAP authentication server, either directly for IEEE 802.11x
or when using hostapd as a RADIUS authentication server.

Affected is hostapd in versions 0.6 - 1.0. The issue was introduced with

Package        : hostapd
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4445

Timo Warns discovered that the internal authentication server of hostapd,
a user space IEEE 802.11 AP and IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticator,
is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing fragmented EAP-TLS
messages.  As a result, an internal overflow checking routine terminates
the process.  An attacker can abuse this flaw to conduct denial of service
attacks via crafted EAP-TLS messages prior to any authentication.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.10-2+squeeze1.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your hostapd packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
