    },
    "OfficialDescription": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "Analysis": {
      "RootCause": "The Xen hypervisor does not properly restrict the period values used to initialize per VCPU periodic timers, allowing a guest to cause an infinite loop on the physical CPU.",
      "Vulnerability": "Improper restriction of timer period values leading to an infinite loop.",
      "Impact": "A malicious guest administrator can cause an infinite loop in Xen, blocking the affected physical CPU indefinitely. If the Xen watchdog is enabled, the whole system will crash. Otherwise the guest can cause the system to become completely unresponsive. This results in a denial of service condition.",
      "AttackVector": "Local guest administrator.",
      "AttackerCapabilities": "A malicious guest administrator must have the ability to set the VCPU with an inappropriate deadline.",
         "AffectedProducts":[
