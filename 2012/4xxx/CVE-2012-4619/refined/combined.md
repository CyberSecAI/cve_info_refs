| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when they are configured for NAT. One of the vulnerabilities requires support for NAT for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to be present in the release.   There are two methods to determine whether a device is configured for NAT:   + Determine whether NAT is active on a running device.   + Determine whether NAT commands are included in the device configuration.Determine Whether NAT Is Active on a Running Device The preferred method to verify whether NAT is enabled on a Cisco IOS   device is to log in to the device and issue the **show ip nat   statistics** command. If NAT is active, the sections **Outside   interfaces** and **Inside interfaces** will each include at   least one interface. The following example shows a device on which the NAT   feature is active:  ```   Router#show ip nat statistics      Total translations: 2 (0 static, 2 dynamic; 0 extended)   Outside interfaces: Serial0   Inside interfaces: Ethernet1   Hits: 135  Misses: 5   Expired translations: 2   Dynamic mappings:   -- Inside Source   access-list 1 pool mypool refcount 2    pool mypool: netmask 255.255.255.0           start 192.168.10.1 end 192.168.10.254           type generic, total addresses 14, allocated 2 (14%), misses 0   ```  Depending on the Cisco IOS Software release, the interface lists can be   in the lines following the **Outside interfaces** and   **Inside interfaces**. In releases that support the **section** filter on **show** commands, the   administrator can determine whether NAT is active by using the **show ip   nat statistics | section interfaces** command, as illustrated in the following example:  ```   Router> show ip nat statistics | section interfaces   Outside interfaces:     GigabitEthernet0/0   Inside interfaces:      GigabitEthernet0/1   Router>   ``` Determine Whether NAT Commands Are Included in the Device Configuration Alternatively, to determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco   IOS Software configuration, either the **ip nat inside** or **ip nat outside** commands must be present in different   interfaces, or in the case of the   [NAT Virtual Interface](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t14/feature/guide/gtnatvi.html%20),   the **ip nat enable** interface command   will be present. The **show configuration | include ip nat** command can be used to determine whether NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following examples:  ```   Router> show configuration | include ip nat     ip nat inside    ip nat outside   Router>   ```  ```   Router> show configuration | include ip nat     ip nat enable   Router>   ``` Determine the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco IOS Software NAT for SIP Denial of Service Vulnerability   The [NAT SIP application layer gateway (ALG)](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t8/feature/guide/ftnatsip.html) feature adds the ability to deploy Cisco IOS NAT between VoIP solutions based on SIP by translating IP addresses that are embedded in the SIP payload of IP packets.      Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability in the NAT processing of SIP packets. This vulnerability is present when the NAT SIP ALG feature is enabled.      NAT SIP ALG is enabled by default, and performs the SIP payload translation of IP packets. NAT SIP translation is done on UDP port 5060 packets by default. The port is configurable using the **ip nat service sip udp port**  global configuration command.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtn76183](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtn76183) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4618   Cisco IOS Software NAT Denial of Service VulnerabilityThe [IP NAT](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/technologies/tk648/tk361/tk438/technologies_white_paper09186a0080091cb9.html) feature permits interconnection of networks when the IP addresses of packets that are moving between the networks need to be translated to be valid in the destination network.   Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability in the NAT processing of IP packets. Exploitation of the vulnerability will cause a DoS condition.         This vulnerability is documented in   Cisco bug ID [CSCtr46123](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr46123) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-4619  Workarounds  * Cisco IOS Software NAT for SIP Denial of Service VulnerabilityThis vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling NAT SIP ALG over UDP transport by using the   **no ip nat service sip udp port 5060**    global configuration command. This command can be configured only in Cisco IOS images that include the NAT ALG SIP feature. Layer 3 NAT translation will continue to be performed on SIP packets, but the SIP payload will not be translated.   Cisco IOS Software NAT Denial of Service VulnerabilityThere are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2012 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release, where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.
