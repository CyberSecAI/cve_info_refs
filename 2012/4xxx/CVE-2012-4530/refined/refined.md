  "vulnerability": "CVE-2012-4530",
  "description": "A memory disclosure flaw was found in the way the load_script() function in the binfmt_script binary format handler handled excessive recursions. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user-space by executing specially-crafted scripts.",
  "affected_components": [
    "Linux kernel"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how `binfmt_script` and `binfmt_misc` handlers manage the `bprm->interp` pointer during recursive executions. When modules are enabled and unprintable bytes are present in `bprm->buf`, execution restarts after attempting to load matching binfmt modules. The handlers leave `bprm->interp` pointing to local stack memory, which can be leaked into the user-space argv areas upon restart.",
    "weaknesses": [
        "Information Exposure",
        "Improper Resource Management"
    ],
  "impact": "An unprivileged local user can leak kernel stack memory to user-space.",
  "attack_vector": "Local, by executing a specially crafted script.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system as a non-privileged user"
