Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-4952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Henry Schein Dentrix G5 software used hard-coded database access credentials that were the same across multiple installations. This means that every instance of Dentrix G5 used the same username and password to connect to its database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798):** The application stored database credentials directly within the software, instead of using a more secure method of storing or generating them.
- **Shared credentials:** The same credentials were used across all installations of the software, meaning a single compromise could impact many systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized data access:** An attacker who obtained the hard-coded credentials could gain access to the database of any Dentrix G5 system.
- **Sensitive data exposure:** The databases contain sensitive patient information which could be exposed, stolen, or misused.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Credential Extraction from a Compromised System:** An attacker could gain access to a system where Dentrix G5 is installed and extract the credentials either via a malware infection or direct access.
- **Network Sniffing:** If network traffic between a Dentrix G5 system and its database were not encrypted, an attacker on the same network could potentially sniff the hardcoded credentials being used to access the database.
- **Brute Force attacks:** While not explicitly mentioned, in theory if an attacker has network access, they could also attempt a brute force attack due to the weak credentials and their wide spread usage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Initial access to one Dentrix G5 system or network:** The attacker needs to either gain access to a system with Dentrix G5 installed on the local network, or have the ability to sniff the network traffic on the local network to intercept the credentials.
- **Network access to the database:** The attacker needs to be on the network or have a network connection where the targeted database is accessible.

**Additional Details:**
- The vendor, Henry Schein, released an update (Dentrix G5 version 15.1.294) to address the vulnerability by implementing a unique database password for each installation. The update also made it more difficult to extract the password from systems or network traffic.
- The vulnerability was made public on 2012-11-22, but the CERT vulnerability note was published later on 2013-04-26.
-  The vulnerability could also be mitigated by restricting network access to the database, enforcing firewall rules, and ensuring that wireless networks are properly secured.
