## Axigen Mail Server directory traversal vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#586556

Original Release Date: 2012-10-31 | Last Revised: 2013-04-02

---

### Overview

Axigen Mail Server contains a directory traversal vulnerability.

### Description

| [CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html): Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory  Axigen Mail Server has a web based administration site which allows authorized administrators to perform certain actions via HTTP. The 'View Log Files' page does not sufficiently filter '..\' from web requests, making it possible for an attacker to browse, delete or download system files of the server.Example:<http://target.example.com:9000/?h=44ea8a6603cbf54e245f37b4ddaf8f36&page=vlf&action=edit&fileName=..\..\..\windows\win.ini><http://target.example.com:9000/?h=44ea8a6603cbf54e245f37b4ddaf8f36&page=vlf&action=delete&fileName=..\..\..\windows\win.ini><http://target.example.com:9000/source/loggin/page\_log\_dwn\_file.hsp?h=44ea8a6603cbf54e245f37b4ddaf8f36&action=download&fileName=..\..\..\windows\win.ini> |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service condition or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing Axigen Mail Server web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
