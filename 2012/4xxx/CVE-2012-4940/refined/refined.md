- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient filtering of '..\' sequences in the 'View Log Files' page of the Axigen Mail Server web administration interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can browse, delete, or download system files of the server. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the web administration interface with '..\' sequences in the `fileName` parameter. Example URLs are provided in the description.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the Axigen Mail Server web administration interface. While the vulnerability description mentions "authorized administrators", the impact section clarifies the attacker can be unauthenticated.
