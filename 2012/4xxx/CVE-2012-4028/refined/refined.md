The article discusses vulnerabilities in Tridium's Niagara Framework, specifically a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the Niagara Framework. This allows attackers to access configuration files that contain usernames, passwords and other sensitive material.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability.
- Weak password hashing algorithm.
- Default security settings are insecure.
- Misconfiguration by users.
- Lack of security awareness by users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can download and decrypt user names and passwords.
- Once passwords are decrypted, attackers can log in to the Niagara Framework as any user.
- Attackers gain control over systems managed by Niagara, including building automation, security systems, and critical infrastructure components.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the internet.
- The attack is performed through web requests, by manipulating the URL of the Niagara Framework.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send web requests to a vulnerable Niagara Framework instance.
- Basic knowledge of web protocols, URLs, and directory traversal techniques.
