- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Endian UTM Firewall v2.4.x application contains multiple non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. These occur because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in dynamically generated web pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Non-persistent XSS vulnerabilities in the `openvpn_users.cgi`, `dnat.cgi#createrule`, and `dansguardian.cgi#addrule` modules.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can allow attackers to hijack user sessions (including those of administrators), conduct phishing attacks, and manipulate client-side content.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local low-privileged users can exploit these vulnerabilities.
    - Remote attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities, but it requires a high degree of user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local low-privileged user access.
    - Remote attackers need some degree of user interaction, such as tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a crafted page.
