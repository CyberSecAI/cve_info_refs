Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4436:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A local buffer overflow exists in the `fwknop` client due to improper handling of arguments when processing the `--last` option and a maliciously crafted `~/.fwknop.run` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `fwknop` client.
- Insufficient input validation of arguments read from `~/.fwknop.run` file when using the `--last` option.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Local code execution is possible. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the `fwknop` client.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify the `~/.fwknop.run` file with malicious content.
- The attacker needs to execute `fwknop` client using the `--last` option.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify the `~/.fwknop.run` file.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute the `fwknop` client with the `--last` option, either by direct access to the system, or using another method such as through a service that calls fwknop client.

The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in `fwknop` version 2.0.3 with the addition of proper validation of `.fwknop.run` arguments.
