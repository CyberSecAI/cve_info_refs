Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4418:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attack. This occurs because the application logic and the signature verification module have different views on the XML data, allowing an attacker to modify the message structure without invalidating the signature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XML Signature Wrapping (XSW):** The core vulnerability is that the Apache Axis2 does not properly validate the signed XML content, allowing an attacker to inject malicious content and have it processed as if it were legitimate. This stems from a disconnect between how the signature is verified and how the message is processed.
-  **Signature Exclusion Attack:**  In some configurations, Axis2 could be exploited by removing the signature element entirely. If no signature element was present, the validation would simply be skipped. Furthermore, the signature over the SAML assertion was completely ignored in Apache Axis2, instead only validating the SOAP body and Timestamp element.
-  **Lack of SAML Conformance:** Some attack variants do not conform to the SAML standard, and yet the vulnerable systems did not detect these issues. Specifically, the XML Signature does not sign it's parent element in some variations.
- **Inconsistent ID processing:** Some systems don't properly check if the ID used in the signature reference matches the ID of the processed assertion. While some do check for this, the checks can be bypassed via the use of multiple elements with the same ID.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Message Forgery:** An attacker can forge messages that appear to be legitimately signed.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting malicious content, an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms.
- **Arbitrary Content Injection:** The attacker can inject arbitrary data which would then be processed by the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack involves modifying the XML message by injecting a forged element with a different ID, or placing the original signed content within a newly created wrapper element. This can involve:
    - Inserting an evil assertion with a different ID in front of the original assertion
    - Embedding the original assertion as a child element into the evil assertion
    - Moving the original Signature element into the evil assertion
    - Placing the original assertion within the signature's Object element.
- These modifications are done in a way that the signature is still considered valid by the signature verification module, but the application logic processes the injected malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Signed SAML Message:** The attacker needs a signed SAML message from the targeted system's IdP (Identity Provider), which can be obtained by either registering as a user of an IdP, or by intercepting and obtaining these messages from unprotected networks (e.g. sniffing).
- The attacker doesn't require real-time eavesdropping or control of the network. Expired assertions can be used.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in a paper presented at USENIX.
- The issue affects multiple SAML frameworks, including OpenSAML (CVE-2011-1411) and Apache Axis2.
- Some systems were vulnerable to "Signature Exclusion Attacks" where the security logic skips the validation step if no Signature element is present.
- The vulnerability was reported to the responsible security teams and in many cases, the researchers collaborated with them to patch the issues.
- A penetration testing tool was developed to automate the discovery of such vulnerabilities in SAML frameworks.
- Red Hat stated that this issue does not affect the version of axis2 shipped with various JBoss and Red Hat products.
