# Vulnerabilities:CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) Overview

Last Updated:Apr 5, 2022

A list of software weakness types to provide a common language for identifying the type of vulnerability

>> [JAPANESE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/vuln/scap/cwe.html)

CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)[(\*1)](#L1) aims to provide a common base to identify the type of software weakness (vulnerability).

 Leading the effort with support from the U.S. government, MITRE[(\*2)](#L2) had been working on a specification since 1999 and published the first draft in March 2006. [More than 40 vendors and research entities](http://cwe.mitre.org/community/index.html) have joined hands to improve and expand the specification since then and the version 1.0 of CWE was published on September 9, 2008.

 CWE gives a hierarchically structured list of weakness types to help identifying software vulnerabilities that come in a wide variety, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and buffer overflow. The use of CWE will enable software developers and security experts to:

1. Have a common language to discuss software vulnerability in architecture, design and code.
2. Use as a standard measuring rule for security tools, such as a vulnerability scanning tool, to enhance software security.
3. Use as a common foundation to understand, mitigate and prevent vulnerability.

CWE has been adopted by NIST[(\*3)](#L3) for NVD[(\*4)](#L4), OWASP[(\*5)](#L5) for Top Ten Project[(\*6)](#L6) and other security vendors.

 This overview is based on CWE Version 1.5, released by MITRE. For more information, please refer to [MITRE CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html).

## 1.CWE Structure

CWE organizes a wide variety of weakness types in a hierarchical structure and gives a unique identifier (CWE-ID) to each type. The weakness types at higher levels in the structure gives a more abstract and broader concept, while those at deeper level gives a more concrete concept or represent an actual CWE entity.

There are four structural classifications in CWE: View, Category, Weakness and Compound Element. Currently, 22 weakness types are classified as View, 105 as Category, 638 as Weakness and 12 as Compound Element. In total, 777 CWE entries are defined and organized in the list.

### (1)View

Each View entry represents a perspective with which one may use CWE and organizes weakness types from the perspective. For example, NIST has handpicked 19 weakness types from CWE based on the vulnerabilities published on NVD and lists them on its Web site ([CWE Cross Section Mapped into by NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories#cwes)). The View that consists of those 19 weakness types is being given the CWE-ID of CWE-635, Weaknesses Used by NVD.

 Likewise, CWE-699 is the View organized from the perspective of developers, CWE-1000 from that of researchers, CWE-658 from that of C and CWE-660 from that of Java.

### (2)Category

Each Category entry, given a âgroupingâ capability, represents a collection of weakness types that share a common characteristic.

For instance, CWE-310 is a group of weakness types with cryptographic issues and CWE-355 with user interface issues.

### (3)Weakness

Each Weakness entry represents an actual CWE entity and is subsequently classified using three attributes: Class, Base and Variant.

The Class attribute suggests the most abstract type of weakness of the three. CWE-362, Race Condition, is an example of this type.

The Base attribute suggests a more specific type of weakness that is independent of specific technology or resource. CWE-567, Unsynchronized Access To Shared Data, is an example of this type.

The Variant attribute suggests a specific type of weakness that is dependent of particular resource, technology or context. CWE-488, Data Leak Between Sessions, is an example of this type.

### (4)Compound Element

Each Compound Element entry represents an aggregation of related weakness types with a composite nature and is subsequently classified using two attributes: Composite and Chain.

The Composite attribute suggests a case where a weakness emerges in combination of another weakness. CWE-352, Cross-Site Request Forgery, is an example of this type.

The Chain attribute suggests a case where a weakness results in another weakness. CWE-680, Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow, is an example of this type.

## 2.Elements of CWE

The [CWE List](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html) is organized by CWE-ID and each CWE entry is provided with various information. To name a few, the CWE elements include Description, Likelihood of Exploit, Common Consequences, Potential Mitigations, Demonstrative Examples and Observed Example.

 Users could use the CWE List as reference to identity, mitigate and prevent vulnerabilities.

## 3.JVN iPedia declared CWE-Compatible

[JVN iPedia](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/) began to support CWE as a trial on September 10, 2008[(\*7)](#Footnote). IPA had worked on a few remaining requirements to make a CWE compatibility declaration and declared it CWE-Compatible on October 3, 2008.

 The official list of organizations participating in the CWE Compatibility and Effectiveness Program is available on Mitreâs CWE web site.

 <http://cwe.mitre.org/compatible/organizations.html>

 [MyJVN](http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/apis/myjvn/) began to support CWE on October 23, 2008[(\*8)](#Footnote).

 The four mandatory requirements â âCWE Searchabilityâ, âCWE Outputâ, âCWE Documentationâ and âMapping Accuracyâ â for phase 1 are fulfilled by the functions illustrated in Table 1.

Table 1. Requirement Correspondence Status of JVN iPedia and MyJVN
| CWE Searchability | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By using the search function in JVN iPedia, the vulnerability countermeasure information database, users are able to conduct a search using CWE identifiers as the keyword. |
| CWE Output | Capability  JVN iPedia   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifiers are displayed in the âReferencesâ section within each vulnerability countermeasure information pages. |
| CWE Output | Capability  MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  CWE identifier is displayed in the âAdvisory, related informationâ section of the detailed information window of each vulnerability countermeasure information. |
| CWE Documentation | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  This material document will become the documentation necessary to describe and demonstrate CWE, CWE association and methods used to satisfy the compatibility requirements. |
| Mapping Accuracy | Capability  JVN iPedia, MyJVN   Fulfillment Method  By setting a JVN iPedia ID in the sec:identifier field of JVNDBRSS, which is used to specify the identifier of the security information, and storing the JVN ID and CWE identifier in the sec:reference field, which are used to specify the URL of the related security information, it is possible to demonstrate the correspondence of the JVN iPedia ID with the CWE identifier. |

Figure 1 shows a hierarchical structure of weakness types to be used by JVN iPedia. It is based on [Development View with Abstractions Highlighted](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdf/699_abstraction_colors.pdf), which is a graph that depicts the hierarchical structure of a View organized from the perspective of developers.

 The yellow-colored ones are to be used by JVN iPedia. For the overall hierarchical structure of the CWE List, please refer to [PDFs with Graphical Depictions of CWE (1.5)](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/pdfs.html).

 IPA will revise the weakness types, analyzing the vulnerabilities published on JVN iPedia, and consider expanding them to include the deeper level of weakness types to support frequently-reported vulnerabilities.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-04 19:16:50 UTC  ``` A flaw in how TLS/DTLS, when CBC-mode encryption is used, communicates was reported.  This vulnerability can allow for a Man-in-the-Middle attacker to recover plaintext from a TLS/DTLS connection, when CBC-mode encryption is used.  This flaw is in the TLS specification, and not a bug in a specific implementation (as such, it affects nearly all implementations).  As such, it affects all TLS and DTLS implementations that are compliant with TLS 1.1 or 1.2, or with DTLS 1.0 or 1.2.  It also applies to implementations of SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 that incorporate countermeasures to deal with previous padding oracle attacks.  All TLS/DTLS ciphersuites that include CBC-mode encryption are potentially vulnerable.  The paper indicates that with OpenSSL, a full plaintext recovery attack is possible, and with GnuTLS, a partial plaintext recovery is possible (recovering up to 4 bits of the last byte in any block of plaintext).  To perform a successful attack, when TLS is used, a large number of TLS sessions are required (target plaintext must be sent repeatedly in the same position in the plaintext stream across the sessions).  For DTLS, a successful attack can be carried out in a single session.  The attacker must also be located close to the machine being attacked.  Further details are noted in the paper.  Current status of fixes in various implementations:  * OpenSSL has a patch in development * NSS has a patch in development * GnuTLS is fixed in versions 2.12.23, 3.0.28, and 3.1.7 * PolarSSL is fixed in version 1.2.5 * BouncyCastle has a patch that will be included in the forthcoming 1.48 version  Full paper:  <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf>  External References:  <http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/> <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20130205.txt> <https://polarssl.org/tech-updates/releases/polarssl-1.2.5-released>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-05 07:12:06 UTC  ``` GnuTLS advisory GNUTLS-SA-2013-1:  <http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2013-1>  GnuTLS fix:  2.12.x: <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/458c67cf98740e7b12404f6c30e0d5317d56fd30> <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/93b7fcfa3297a9123630704668b2946f602b910e>  3.0.x: <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/8dc2822966f64dd9cf7dde9c7aacd80d49d3ffe5>  3.2.x / master: <https://gitorious.org/gnutls/gnutls/commit/328ee22c1b3951e060c7124c7cb1cee592c59bc0>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c2)  Huzaifa S.

Namely, we are stuck with version 1.46 because the later version (1.47) comes with backward incompatible API changes. This affects the dependent libraries, in particular itext. Unfortunately we are also stuck with itext-2.1.7 because the next version series (itext-5.*) was vetoed by FE-Legal.   Note that I do not maintain bouncycastle any more. I dropped my maintainership last August after an announcement in the Fedora-devel mailing list. To my knowledge no one picked it up yet, which makes me wonder why this bug CCd me. I can still provide some help though if you can supply a patch. If you provide a patch for bouncycastle-1.46 we can get around this problem.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=907589#c8)  Huzaifa S.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0990 : Ward van Wanrooij

* **Note**: Starting with OS X v10.8.4, Java Web Start (i.e., JNLP) applications downloaded from the Internet need to be signed with a Developer ID certificate. Gatekeeper will check downloaded Java Web Start applications for a signature and block such applications from launching if they are not properly signed.

  You can use the codesign utility to sign the JNLP file, which will attach the code signature to the JNLP file as extended attributes. To preserve these attributes, package the JNLP file in a ZIP, XIP, or DMG file. Be careful using the ZIP format, as some third-party tools might not capture the required extended attributes correctly.

It DOES need improvement, currently it mostly detects the beginning of the cookie (~10 chars)

There is no need for (guessing and) adding a whole POST into the body. This works quite nice:

```

xorninja here. one question: why do you repeat the headers in HEADERS and BODY, then compress them twice?

def findnext(b,bs,charset):

#print "body len",len(b)

baselen = len(compress(HEADERS +

b +

bs))

possible\_chars = findnext(BODY + cookie, "", charset)

[@stamparm](https://github.com/stamparm) - I started with the shorter body, but practice shows that it rarely gave away full cookie. With longer body it's working much much better.

This attack is supposed to be presented 10 days from now, but my guess is that they use **compression**.

[SSL/TLS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246) optionally supports data compression. In the `ClientHello` message, the client states the list of compression algorithms that it knows of, and the server responds, in the `ServerHello`, with the compression algorithm that will be used. Compression algorithms are specified by one-byte identifiers, and TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246) defines only the `null` compression method (i.e. no compression at all). Other documents specify compression methods, in particular [RFC 3749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3749) which defines compression method 1, based on [DEFLATE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951), the LZ77-derivative which is at the core of the GZip format and also modern Zip archives. When compression is used, it is applied on all the transferred data, as a long stream. In particular, when used with HTTPS, compression is applied on all the successive HTTP requests in the stream, header included. DEFLATE works by locating repeated subsequences of bytes.

Suppose that the attacker uses some JavaScript code which can send arbitrary requests to a target site (e.g. a bank) and runs on the attacked machine; the browser will send these requests with the user's cookie for that bank -- the cookie value that the attacker is after. Also, let's suppose that the attacker can observe the traffic between the user's machine and the bank (plausibly, the attacker has access to the same LAN of Wi-Fi hotspot than the victim; or he has hijacked a router somewhere on the path, possibly close to the bank server).

For this example, we suppose that the cookie in each HTTP request looks like this:

> Cookie: secret=7xc89f+94/wa

The attacker knows the `Cookie: secret=` part and wishes to obtain the secret value. So he instructs his JavaScript code to issue a request containing in the *body* the sequence `Cookie: secret=0`. The HTTP request will look like this:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: thebankserver.com
(...)
Cookie: secret=7xc89f+94/wa
(...)

Cookie: secret=0

```

When DEFLATE sees that, it will recognize the repeated `Cookie: secret=` sequence and represent the second instance with a very short token (one which states "previous sequence has length 15 and was located *n* bytes in the past); DEFLATE will have to emit an extra token for the '0'.

The request goes to the server. From the outside, the eavesdropping part of the attacker sees an opaque blob (SSL encrypts the data) but he can see the blob *length* (with byte granularity when the connection uses RC4; with block ciphers there is a bit of padding, but the attacker can adjust the contents of his requests so that he may phase with block boundaries, so, in practice, the attacker can know the length of the compressed request).

Now, the attacker tries again, with `Cookie: secret=1` in the request body. Then, `Cookie: secret=2`, and so on. All these requests will compress to the same size (almost -- there are subtleties with Huffman codes as used in DEFLATE), **except** the one which contains `Cookie: secret=7`, which compresses better (16 bytes of repeated subsequence instead of 15), and thus will be shorter. The attacker sees that. Therefore, in a few dozen requests, the attacker has guessed the first byte of the secret value.

He then just has to repeat the process (`Cookie: secret=70`, `Cookie: secret=71`, and so on) and obtain, byte by byte, the complete secret.

---

What I describe above is what I thought of when I read the article, which talks about "information leak" from an "optional feature". I cannot know for sure that what will be published as the CRIME attack is really based upon compression. However, I do not see how the attack on compression cannot work. Therefore, regardless of whether CRIME turns out to abuse compression or be something completely different, you should turn off compression support from your client (or your server).

Note that I am talking about compression at the SSL level. HTTP *also* includes optional compression, but this one applies only to the *body* of the requests and responses, not the header, and thus does not cover the `Cookie:` header line. HTTP-level compression is fine.

(It is a shame to have to remove SSL compression, because it is very useful to lower bandwidth requirements, especially when a site contains many small pictures or is Ajax-heavy with many small requests, all beginning with extremely similar versions of a mammoth HTTP header. It would be better if the security model of JavaScript was fixed to prevent malicious code from sending arbitrary requests to a bank server; I am not sure it is easy, though.)

---

**Edit 2012/09/12:** The attack above can be optimized a bit by doing a dichotomy. Imagine that the secret value is in Base64, i.e. there are 64 possible values for each unknown character. The attacker can make a request containing 32 copies of `Cookie: secret=X` (for 32 variants of the `X` character). If one of them matches the actual cookie, the total compressed length with be shorter than otherwise. Once the attacker knows which half of his alphabet the unknown byte is part of, he can try again with a 16/16 split, and so on. In 6 requests, this homes in the unknown byte value (because 26 = 64). If the secret value is in hexadecimal, the 6 requests become 4 requests (24 = 16). Dichotomy explains [this recent twit of Juliano Rizzo](https://twitter.com/julianor/status/245943430570704896).

---

**Edit 2012/09/13:** [**IT IS CONFIRMED.**](http://threatpost.com/crime-attack-uses-compression-ratio-tls-requests-side-channel-hijack-secure-sessions-091312/) The CRIME attack abuses compression, in a way similar to what is explained above. The actual "body" in which the attacker inserts presumed copies of the cookie can actually be the *path* in a simple request which can be triggered by a most basic `<img>` tag; no need for fancy exploits of the same-origin-policy.

  Good analysis; I hope CRIME *is* this and we don't have two vulns of this size in play! However, I wouldn't say that being limited to entity bodies makes HTTP-level compression safe in general... whilst a cookie header is an obvious first choice of attack, there is potentially sensitive material in the body too. eg Imagine sniffing an anti-XSRF token from response body by causing the browser to send fields that get reflected in that response.

  ... and the Chromium commit is linked to a bug that is not public (it gets a 403 error, as opposed to a 404 for non-existent bug numbers). So probably a security bug.

To add to Thomas Pornin's outstanding answer, I wanted to point out some prior work on the subject of compression and cryptography. Take a look at the following research paper:

* John Kelsey. [Compression and Information Leakage of Plaintext](http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/FSE/3091/3091.pdf). FSE 2002.

That paper describes chosen-plaintext attacks against systems that (a) compress data before encrypting it, and (b) where an eavesdrop can observe the length of the resulting ciphertexts.

The attacks that are conceptually vaguely similar to what Thomas Pornin describes. The paper even mentions that TLS uses optional compression before encryption. However, at the time I don't think anyone realized that this enables an attack on HTTP over TLS, or that an attacker could learn the value of secret cookies sent over a TLS-encrypted connection. The paper looks at attacks on compression mainly in the abstract, rather than in the specific context of the web, and is pretty theoretical. So, CRIME (or Thomas Pornin's attack) is still a significant novel extension of these ideas.

Nonetheless, this is an interesting paper that anticipates the general sort of attack at issue here, even if it did not realize the consequences for web security. It is interesting that the general sort of issue was first described in the research literature 10 years ago, yet it took that long for the security community to fully appreciate the practical consequences of this work. Crypto sure ain't easy, is it?

Just to add to great Thomas answer, it seems that to successfully leak the cookie value the actual POST body sent should not only be the:

```
Cookie: secret=....

```

but should contain much more text from the POST header, like so:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: thebankserver.com
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1
Accept: */*
Referer: https://thebankserver.com/
Cookie: secret=...

```

This POST contents can be easily constructed with Javascript (e.g. he will retrieve user agent via `navigator` object), so that is not a problem in the attack scenario.

In practice, attacker can mutate the body even more, e.g. by putting the cookie value multiple times, putting multiple Cookie headers, using only parts of the POST headers in the body etc.

Based on @xorninja code I've constructed the [adaptive algorithm](https://gist.github.com/3696912) that duplicates the whole request header in the body, and tries to shorten it iteratively if the results for the next cookie character are unclear. Results are promising, at least 8 characters are detected now.. When no character can be detected this way, the request body is shortened by removing one header and the process continues. It can successfully leak arbitrary cookie values. Feel free to improve.

  @nicowass I guess it's possible to use different amounts of repeats of the guessed cookie value to validate multiple candidates at once. I think the CRIME authors simply spend some more time fine-tuning their algorithm.

  Could we protect the cookie value by adding a random length random stream of characters to it?

* @AranMulholland Such session tokens are already a random stream of characters in the first place, under a proper system. If you propose appending a unique random string to *each* request's auth cookie, there are easy workarounds for the attacker (such doing each trial several times to average out the effects of the random string on compression). You'll only increase their effort by a small factor.

To know the format of cookies used for the web site you are targetting. Specifically, whatever cookie contains authentication. 2. The ability to injection a request to the target web server while someone is connected (such as with JavaScript, an XSS, or plug-in). 3. Ability to monitor the SSL connection is it is transported across TCP.

Having control of other parts of the request should be sufficient (e.g., using request headers, request body, etc). As for manipulating cookies from the MITM perspective, here's one clunky way to do it: redirect the victim's browser to the plain-text version of the target web site, intercept that request, and set a new cookie (pretending to be the plain-text version of the target web site). The next request to the secure version of the target web site should contain the injected cookie. As tptacek mentioned in another comment, this approach would not work with a site that uses HTTP Strict Transport Security. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511867)   | [root](#4510877) | [parent](#4511796) | [next](#4511064) [–]  The attack as Pornin outlines it does not involve controlling the cookie header, but rather on being able to get content into the client's TX stream that happens to match the cookie header; think in terms of things like query args and post data.

Alternatively an attacker could put the test content in the URL (we don't care if it 404s), which would work just as well and allow them to use a series of script-free pages full of images. edit: tptacek is absolutely right; there isn't a way to defend against this in application code.

Generalize it past HTTPS and its elements are: 1. Attacker controls some parts of plaintext 2. Attacker's content is mixed with content attacker wants to discover 3.

Don't get me wrong, you'll get variance with deflate as well, but it's nowhere near the level of something like bzip2.

These days, even when we don't include cryptographic fingerprints (e.g., with the hash-and-encrypt construction *C = E(M || H(M))* ) there's enough structure in compression format *headers* to allow an attacker to recognize if he has the right key... and he isn't going to be running a brute-force attack anyway. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511289)   | [root](#4511148) | [parent](#4511275) | [next](#4511175) [–]  Strong agree.

The data itself isn't creating problems - what's new is the ability for the attacker to ask interactive questions of the parties. When authenticating messages, a receiver necessarily gains the ability to reject a message as invalid. Adaptive chosen plaintext attacks arise when this rejection ends up containing more information than a simple Y/N. From the perspective of an attacker, the verifier becomes an oracle capable of answering say "How *many* bytes are valid", leading to a sub-brute-force attack. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cperciva](user?id=cperciva) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511175)   | [root](#4511148) | [parent](#4511151) | [prev](#4511212) | [next](#4511221) [–]  Yes.

The problem starts when you let an attacker add chosen plain-text before or after the secret in the same compressed and encrypted stream. Compression before encryption is not a problem if the sender is the only person that decides what is in the message to be sent.

In theory, protocols which fall to attacks when attackers have control of some of the message are said to be vulnerable to "chosen plaintext attacks" (if the attacker only gets 1 shot per message) or "adaptive chosen plaintext attacks" (if the attacker gets many bites at the same apple). Sound protocols don't have feasible adaptive chosen plaintext attacks. In practice, most protocols can be coerced into carrying some data controlled by attackers. Sneaking some attacker-controlled data into a message is a very low bar for an attacker to clear. It's true that content-controlled Javascript code makes it distinctively easy for an attacker to spirit their data into the plaintext, but don't let that confuse you. For the HTTPS/TLS cryptosystem to be sound, attackers can't use this property to decrypt the content they *didn't* add to the message. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [zurn](user?id=zurn) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511250)   | [root](#4511148) | [parent](#4511175) | [prev](#4513567) | [next](#4511411) [–]  The excuses I've heard for it include 1) can't do compression after the crypto, and 2) it reduces ciphertext available to attackers.

Lots of practical crypto implementation attacks depend on plaintext structure, especially in their most naive and straightforward implementations.

I've studied cryptography theory, and I've implemented various ciphers and attacks, and the more I learn the more certain I become that I would never, ever use any of my own crypto code in production. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pbiggar](user?id=pbiggar) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511191)   | [prev](#4511108) | [next](#4511285) [–]  Reading the title, I thought that Chrome was turning of gzip based compression for HTTP bodies when using SSL. According to <http://security.stackexchange.com/a/19914> (linked above by jgrahamc), it is in fact header compression that is TLS specific. So a giant sigh of relief from me. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wladimir](user?id=wladimir) [on Sept 13, 2012](item?id=4514969)   | [parent](#4511191) | [next](#4511285) [–]  Thanks for noting this. I also got this wrong on the first reading. Having to drop gzip compression of the content would be terrible. I fathom that header compression helps if you have many requests (polling etc), but for most websites it is much less influential in bandwidth usage. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cryptbe](user?id=cryptbe) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511285)   | [prev](#4511191) | [next](#4511225) [–]  Problem 1 in Stanford's crypto class [1]: Data compression is often used in data storage or transmission. Suppose you want to use data compression in conjunction with encryption. Does it make more sense to A. Compress the data and then encrypt the result, or B. Encrypt the data and then compress the result. Now we know the correct answer is Neither.

The question is, in light of this result, frustratingly imprecise. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [geofft](user?id=geofft) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511604)   | [parent](#4511285) | [prev](#4511426) | [next](#4511225) [–]  Well, B makes no sense. A makes sense, but might have leaks, that depending on use case (and in particular, whether the attacker can execute chosen plaintext attacks like in SSL) may or may not weaken the system, but it still makes sense. For a confusing example of a fairly leaky cryptosystem involving compression that works well in practice and has a proof of security that is aware of the leak, see Douceur et al.'s "convergent encryption".

By randomizing the effectiveness of the compression, surely this attack can be generally prevented by the browser? You could argue that given enough samples the noise could be filtered and the attack still remains, but the same could be said the same for many successful patches over the years (TCP sequence number randomization, Kaminsky's DNS issue, etc.), and the number of samples required would be pretty infeasible. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [riannucci](user?id=riannucci) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4512335)   | [parent](#4511670) | [next](#4514513) [–]  I'm fairly certain this could be defeated with a little differential cryptanalysis.

It'd have to be padding to a given number of bytes, but that probably has a vulnerability too. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tonyb](user?id=tonyb) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511026)   | [prev](#4511670) | [next](#4514898) [–]  Doesn't look like this has anything to do with an exploit. It is because some older web servers who don't support TLS also don't support compression.

OpenSSL allocates alot of memory per connection for compression/decompression. See [http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2011/04/05/openssl-m...](http://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2011/04/05/openssl-memory-use/) for a great discussion of why SSL\_OP\_NO\_COMPRESSION might make sense for you. Even if you don't have direct access to the library code creating SSL objects, there are still some tricks with ctypes, ffi, dlopen that have the same effect. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tonfa](user?id=tonfa) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511351)   | [prev](#4514898) | [next](#4511601) [–]  Does the attack apply to SPDY as well? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [njs12345](user?id=njs12345) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4512534)   | [parent](#4511351) | [next](#4511601) [–]  I think it does, although not precisely as described in the SO post above: in SPDY the request headers are compressed separately before any TLS compression would apply, so the attacker would have to put her guess of the cookie in the request headers or the URL (as the URL is sent as a pseudo-header in SPDY). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ivanr](user?id=ivanr) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511601)   | [prev](#4511351) | [next](#4512523) [–]  It would be interesting to know if there were any changes in the SPDY implementation. It too supports compression before encryption and may be affected by the same problem. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [anonymous](user?id=anonymous) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4512523)   | [prev](#4511601) | [next](#4513714) [–]  So, to summarize for the laypeople, if the user has Javascript and/or cookies disabled, this exploit will not work? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Daniel\_Newby](user?id=Daniel_Newby) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4512815)   | [parent](#4512523) | [next](#4513025) [–]  Hidden <iframe> elements would probably work just as well. It might even work with JacaScript turned. Have a page with nested iframes. Serve each one from a different IP address and have the server not answer right away. The server answers with the first iframe having a chosen URL while Eve snoops the wire. Eve tells the server which URL to use for the next iframe body that it sends. Repeat until the cookie is deduced. The server can use a nested tree of iframes to avoid having a bazillion iframes in the top level document. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fakjshflaskjhf](user?id=fakjshflaskjhf) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4513025)   | [parent](#4512523) | [prev](#4512815) | [next](#4513714) [–]  Javascript just makes the attack faster, but it can be accomplished with raw html. Cookies are required though; it's what you are after when using this attack. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [alanh](user?id=alanh) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4513714)   | [prev](#4512523) | [next](#4512058) [–]  Is this a disabling of compression on both ends? No DEFLATE on either requests or responses? Will a site using HTTPS be able to serve compressed assets (like javascript & css)? If not, we’ll urgently need a way for site devs to whitelist precomputed (and thus immune) static assets for compression. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [caf](user?id=caf) [on Sept 13, 2012](item?id=4514518)   | [parent](#4513714) | [next](#4512058) [–]  It's a disabling of the optional compression at the TLS layer. HTTP content compression is not affected. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [alanh](user?id=alanh) [on Sept 13, 2012](item?id=4514524)   | [root](#4513714) | [parent](#4514518) | [next](#4512058) [–]  So what, exactly, is no longer compressed? Merely the headers themselves, and the content is not affected? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [caf](user?id=caf) [on Sept 14, 2012](item?id=4519493)   | [root](#4513714) | [parent](#4514524) | [next](#4512058) [–]  Pretty much, yes. With the proviso that if you *didn't* have HTTP Content-Type compression for your content before, then it might still have been compressed at the TLS layer, and won't be now. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [cryptlamex](user?id=cryptlamex) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4512058)   | [prev](#4513714) | [next](#4511160) [–]  CRIME researcher says 4 request are enough to decrypt: <https://twitter.com/julianor/status/245943430570704896> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Daniel\_Newby](user?id=Daniel_Newby) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4512836)   | [parent](#4512058) | [next](#4511160) [–]  To decrypt *each byte*. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [sanxiyn](user?id=sanxiyn) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511160)   | [prev](#4512058) [–]  man sshd\_config. Compression: Specifies whether compression is allowed, or delayed until the user has authenticated successfully. The argument must be "yes", "delayed", or "no". The default is "delayed". I don't know why they chose "delayed" as default, but this seems to prevent this attack. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tptacek](user?id=tptacek) [on Sept 12, 2012](item?id=4511214)   | [parent](#4511160) [–]  The SSH protocol is nothing like TLS. The SSH security model is nothing like the TLS security model. Pornin's guess about Thai and Juliano's attack does not break the TLS authentication model; it breaks the confidentiality guarantees TLS makes to the application layer. If you authenticated TLS with certificates the way SSH authenticates with keys, you wouldn't worry about the compression attack. So, not so much. | | --- | --- | --- | | |

The issue is planned to be presented by them on the ekoparty 2012 conference.  <http://www.ekoparty.org/2012/juliano-rizzo.php> <http://www.ekoparty.org/2012/thai-duong.php> <http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/BEAST-creators-develop-new-SSL-attack-1702136.html> <http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/new-attack-uses-ssltls-information-leak-hijack-https-sessions-090512>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-13 13:38:02 UTC  ``` After the announcement of the upcoming presentation of CRIME, researches started to investigate what the issue used by CRIME may be, resulting in publication attack taking advantage of information leak resulting from the use of compression in the SSL/TLS, such as following write-up from Thomas Pornin:  <http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/>  Several additional resources now confirm that the CRIME attack is the same as the problem identified by Thomas Pornin, and explain the meaning of CRIME abbreviation as "Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy":  <http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/crime-hijacks-https-sessions/> <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGPhHYyg9r4> <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/2887>  In addition to zlib/deflate compression used by SSL/TLS, another attack vector using SPDY protocol with compression over non-compressed SSL/TLS connection is mentioned.  Also the following research paper form 2002 was pointed out, which discusses similar problems in the use of compression in SSL/TLS:  <http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/paper.php?pubkey=3091>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-13 18:17:51 UTC  ``` GNUTLS-SA-2012-4 notes the CRIME attack:  <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>  and indicates that GnuTLS does not enable compression by default.  It also indicates that if compression is enabled, use the CBC ciphers which, while not mitigating the attack, make it substantially harder to succeed.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-09-14 11:28:31 UTC  ``` Other references: <https://lwn.net/Articles/516038/> <https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/crime-attack-uses-compression-ratio-tls-requests-side-channel-hijack-secure-sessions-091312> <http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19911/crime-how-to-beat-the-beast-successor/19914#19914>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-14 12:08:12 UTC  ``` Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 currently contain Mozilla Firefox version 10.0.x ESR.  Those versions:  - do not request the use of zlib compression in the SSL/TLS protocol - do not support SPDY protocol  Therefore, they are not affected by either of the published attack vectors.  The support for SPDY protocol was added upstream in Firefox version 11, and only enabled by default in version 13.  Version 15 disables SPDY protocol compression.  <http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/11.0/releasenotes/> <https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/spdy-brings-responsive-and-scalable-transport-to-firefox-11/> <http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/13.0/releasenotes/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-14 12:53:39 UTC  ``` OpenSSL enables zlib compression by default for both clients and servers starting with version 0.9.8:  <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=9594>  The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (starting with RHBA-2009:0181 update released in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3) and 6, and also in Fedora, contain a patch that makes the library check if OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB environment variable is set (can have arbitrary value, even empty string) and disable the default zlib support.  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssl.git/tree/openssl-0.9.8j-env-nozlib.patch?id=1d20b5f2>  Setting the OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB environment variable before starting a client or a server application using OpenSSL can be used to disable zlib compression support and hence mitigate this flaw.  For example, httpd with mod_ssl has compression enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and hence it is used when client also supports it.  Adding the following line to the /etc/sysconfig/httpd file:    export OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB=1  and restarting the httpd service disables the use of SSL/TLS compression in mod_ssl and the compression will not be negotiated even when connecting client supports it.  Note that this environment variable only affects the use of SSL/TLS protocol compression and does not affect the use of HTTP protocol compression implemented by the mod_deflate module.  The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 are based on upstream version 0.9.7a and do not enable SSL/TLS zlib compression.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-14 14:01:15 UTC  ``` Network Security Services (NSS) library, also used by Mozilla Firefox, does not enable zlib compression by default.  The use of httpd with mod_nss on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 is not affected by this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c8)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-14 20:42:34 UTC  ``` Another interesting writeup:  <http://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2012/09/tls-crime-beast-and-you-programmer.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-16 16:54:25 UTC  ``` Following CVE ids were assigned to this issue:  [CVE-2012-4929](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4929) - for the SSL/TLS zlib/deflate attack variant [CVE-2012-4930](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4930) - the the SPDY over SSL/TLS connection without compression, now tracked via separate [bug 857737](show_bug.cgi?id=857737 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2012-4930 SPDY: SSL/TLS CRIME attack")   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c10)  Huzaifa S.

This attack is supposed to be presented 10 days from now, but my guess is that they use **compression**.

[SSL/TLS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246) optionally supports data compression. In the `ClientHello` message, the client states the list of compression algorithms that it knows of, and the server responds, in the `ServerHello`, with the compression algorithm that will be used. Compression algorithms are specified by one-byte identifiers, and TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246) defines only the `null` compression method (i.e. no compression at all). Other documents specify compression methods, in particular [RFC 3749](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3749) which defines compression method 1, based on [DEFLATE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951), the LZ77-derivative which is at the core of the GZip format and also modern Zip archives. When compression is used, it is applied on all the transferred data, as a long stream. In particular, when used with HTTPS, compression is applied on all the successive HTTP requests in the stream, header included. DEFLATE works by locating repeated subsequences of bytes.

Suppose that the attacker uses some JavaScript code which can send arbitrary requests to a target site (e.g. a bank) and runs on the attacked machine; the browser will send these requests with the user's cookie for that bank -- the cookie value that the attacker is after. Also, let's suppose that the attacker can observe the traffic between the user's machine and the bank (plausibly, the attacker has access to the same LAN of Wi-Fi hotspot than the victim; or he has hijacked a router somewhere on the path, possibly close to the bank server).

For this example, we suppose that the cookie in each HTTP request looks like this:

> Cookie: secret=7xc89f+94/wa

The attacker knows the `Cookie: secret=` part and wishes to obtain the secret value. So he instructs his JavaScript code to issue a request containing in the *body* the sequence `Cookie: secret=0`. The HTTP request will look like this:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: thebankserver.com
(...)
Cookie: secret=7xc89f+94/wa
(...)

Cookie: secret=0

```

When DEFLATE sees that, it will recognize the repeated `Cookie: secret=` sequence and represent the second instance with a very short token (one which states "previous sequence has length 15 and was located *n* bytes in the past); DEFLATE will have to emit an extra token for the '0'.

The request goes to the server. From the outside, the eavesdropping part of the attacker sees an opaque blob (SSL encrypts the data) but he can see the blob *length* (with byte granularity when the connection uses RC4; with block ciphers there is a bit of padding, but the attacker can adjust the contents of his requests so that he may phase with block boundaries, so, in practice, the attacker can know the length of the compressed request).

Now, the attacker tries again, with `Cookie: secret=1` in the request body. Then, `Cookie: secret=2`, and so on. All these requests will compress to the same size (almost -- there are subtleties with Huffman codes as used in DEFLATE), **except** the one which contains `Cookie: secret=7`, which compresses better (16 bytes of repeated subsequence instead of 15), and thus will be shorter. The attacker sees that. Therefore, in a few dozen requests, the attacker has guessed the first byte of the secret value.

He then just has to repeat the process (`Cookie: secret=70`, `Cookie: secret=71`, and so on) and obtain, byte by byte, the complete secret.

---

What I describe above is what I thought of when I read the article, which talks about "information leak" from an "optional feature". I cannot know for sure that what will be published as the CRIME attack is really based upon compression. However, I do not see how the attack on compression cannot work. Therefore, regardless of whether CRIME turns out to abuse compression or be something completely different, you should turn off compression support from your client (or your server).

Note that I am talking about compression at the SSL level. HTTP *also* includes optional compression, but this one applies only to the *body* of the requests and responses, not the header, and thus does not cover the `Cookie:` header line. HTTP-level compression is fine.

(It is a shame to have to remove SSL compression, because it is very useful to lower bandwidth requirements, especially when a site contains many small pictures or is Ajax-heavy with many small requests, all beginning with extremely similar versions of a mammoth HTTP header. It would be better if the security model of JavaScript was fixed to prevent malicious code from sending arbitrary requests to a bank server; I am not sure it is easy, though.)

**Edit 2012/09/12:** The attack above can be optimized a bit by doing a dichotomy. Imagine that the secret value is in Base64, i.e. there are 64 possible values for each unknown character. The attacker can make a request containing 32 copies of `Cookie: secret=X` (for 32 variants of the `X` character). If one of them matches the actual cookie, the total compressed length with be shorter than otherwise. Once the attacker knows which half of his alphabet the unknown byte is part of, he can try again with a 16/16 split, and so on. In 6 requests, this homes in the unknown byte value (because 26 = 64). If the secret value is in hexadecimal, the 6 requests become 4 requests (24 = 16). Dichotomy explains [this recent twit of Juliano Rizzo](https://twitter.com/julianor/status/245943430570704896).

**Edit 2012/09/13:** [**IT IS CONFIRMED.**](http://threatpost.com/crime-attack-uses-compression-ratio-tls-requests-side-channel-hijack-secure-sessions-091312/) The CRIME attack abuses compression, in a way similar to what is explained above. The actual "body" in which the attacker inserts presumed copies of the cookie can actually be the *path* in a simple request which can be triggered by a most basic `<img>` tag; no need for fancy exploits of the same-origin-policy.

  Wow. A fantastically impressive answer! P.S. Maybe me need to have more folks claiming they can break widespread cryptosystems, without saying how, if that inspires folks like ThomasPornin to come up with creative attacks like this!

  Good analysis; I hope CRIME *is* this and we don't have two vulns of this size in play! However, I wouldn't say that being limited to entity bodies makes HTTP-level compression safe in general... whilst a cookie header is an obvious first choice of attack, there is potentially sensitive material in the body too. eg Imagine sniffing an anti-XSRF token from response body by causing the browser to send fields that get reflected in that response.

  It looks like this one is correct - Chromium disabled TLS compression on August 3rd: [chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10825183](https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10825183)

  ... and the Chromium commit is linked to a bug that is not public (it gets a 403 error, as opposed to a 404 for non-existent bug numbers). So probably a security bug.

To add to Thomas Pornin's outstanding answer, I wanted to point out some prior work on the subject of compression and cryptography. Take a look at the following research paper:

* John Kelsey. [Compression and Information Leakage of Plaintext](http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/FSE/3091/3091.pdf). FSE 2002.

That paper describes chosen-plaintext attacks against systems that (a) compress data before encrypting it, and (b) where an eavesdrop can observe the length of the resulting ciphertexts.

The attacks that are conceptually vaguely similar to what Thomas Pornin describes. The paper even mentions that TLS uses optional compression before encryption. However, at the time I don't think anyone realized that this enables an attack on HTTP over TLS, or that an attacker could learn the value of secret cookies sent over a TLS-encrypted connection. The paper looks at attacks on compression mainly in the abstract, rather than in the specific context of the web, and is pretty theoretical. So, CRIME (or Thomas Pornin's attack) is still a significant novel extension of these ideas.

Nonetheless, this is an interesting paper that anticipates the general sort of attack at issue here, even if it did not realize the consequences for web security. It is interesting that the general sort of issue was first described in the research literature 10 years ago, yet it took that long for the security community to fully appreciate the practical consequences of this work. Crypto sure ain't easy, is it?

  This publication may also be relevant: "TLS Compression Fingerprinting and a Privacy-aware API for TLS." It is possible the browsers disabled compression because of this result.

Just to add to great Thomas answer, it seems that to successfully leak the cookie value the actual POST body sent should not only be the:

```
Cookie: secret=....

```

but should contain much more text from the POST header, like so:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: thebankserver.com
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1207.1 Safari/537.1
Accept: */*
Referer: https://thebankserver.com/
Cookie: secret=...

```

This POST contents can be easily constructed with Javascript (e.g. he will retrieve user agent via `navigator` object), so that is not a problem in the attack scenario.

In practice, attacker can mutate the body even more, e.g. by putting the cookie value multiple times, putting multiple Cookie headers, using only parts of the POST headers in the body etc.

Based on @xorninja code I've constructed the [adaptive algorithm](https://gist.github.com/3696912) that duplicates the whole request header in the body, and tries to shorten it iteratively if the results for the next cookie character are unclear. Results are promising, at least 8 characters are detected now.. When no character can be detected this way, the request body is shortened by removing one header and the process continues. It can successfully leak arbitrary cookie values. Feel free to improve.

  @nicowass I guess it's possible to use different amounts of repeats of the guessed cookie value to validate multiple candidates at once. I think the CRIME authors simply spend some more time fine-tuning their algorithm.

  Could we protect the cookie value by adding a random length random stream of characters to it?

* @AranMulholland Such session tokens are already a random stream of characters in the first place, under a proper system. If you propose appending a unique random string to *each* request's auth cookie, there are easy workarounds for the attacker (such doing each trial several times to average out the effects of the random string on compression). You'll only increase their effort by a small factor.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-13 13:18:13 UTC  ``` Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong, researches that reported BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS, [bug #737506](show_bug.cgi?id=737506 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3389 HTTPS: block-wise chosen-plaintext attack against SSL/TLS (BEAST)")) attack announced they are planning to disclose another attack against SSL/TLS named CRIME. The issue is planned to be presented by them on the ekoparty 2012 conference.  <http://www.ekoparty.org/2012/juliano-rizzo.php> <http://www.ekoparty.org/2012/thai-duong.php> <http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/BEAST-creators-develop-new-SSL-attack-1702136.html> <http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/new-attack-uses-ssltls-information-leak-hijack-https-sessions-090512>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-13 13:38:02 UTC  ``` After the announcement of the upcoming presentation of CRIME, researches started to investigate what the issue used by CRIME may be, resulting in publication attack taking advantage of information leak resulting from the use of compression in the SSL/TLS, such as following write-up from Thomas Pornin:  <http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/>  Several additional resources now confirm that the CRIME attack is the same as the problem identified by Thomas Pornin, and explain the meaning of CRIME abbreviation as "Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy":  <http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/crime-hijacks-https-sessions/> <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGPhHYyg9r4> <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.network.gnutls.general/2887>  In addition to zlib/deflate compression used by SSL/TLS, another attack vector using SPDY protocol with compression over non-compressed SSL/TLS connection is mentioned.  Also the following research paper form 2002 was pointed out, which discusses similar problems in the use of compression in SSL/TLS:  <http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/paper.php?pubkey=3091>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-13 18:17:51 UTC  ``` GNUTLS-SA-2012-4 notes the CRIME attack:  <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html>  and indicates that GnuTLS does not enable compression by default.  It also indicates that if compression is enabled, use the CBC ciphers which, while not mitigating the attack, make it substantially harder to succeed.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-09-14 11:28:31 UTC  ``` Other references: <https://lwn.net/Articles/516038/> <https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/crime-attack-uses-compression-ratio-tls-requests-side-channel-hijack-secure-sessions-091312> <http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19911/crime-how-to-beat-the-beast-successor/19914#19914>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-14 12:08:12 UTC  ``` Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 currently contain Mozilla Firefox version 10.0.x ESR.  Those versions:  - do not request the use of zlib compression in the SSL/TLS protocol - do not support SPDY protocol  Therefore, they are not affected by either of the published attack vectors.  The support for SPDY protocol was added upstream in Firefox version 11, and only enabled by default in version 13.  Version 15 disables SPDY protocol compression.  <http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/11.0/releasenotes/> <https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/02/spdy-brings-responsive-and-scalable-transport-to-firefox-11/> <http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/13.0/releasenotes/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-14 12:53:39 UTC  ``` OpenSSL enables zlib compression by default for both clients and servers starting with version 0.9.8:  <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=9594>  The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (starting with RHBA-2009:0181 update released in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3) and 6, and also in Fedora, contain a patch that makes the library check if OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB environment variable is set (can have arbitrary value, even empty string) and disable the default zlib support.  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/openssl.git/tree/openssl-0.9.8j-env-nozlib.patch?id=1d20b5f2>  Setting the OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB environment variable before starting a client or a server application using OpenSSL can be used to disable zlib compression support and hence mitigate this flaw.  For example, httpd with mod_ssl has compression enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and hence it is used when client also supports it.  Adding the following line to the /etc/sysconfig/httpd file:    export OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB=1  and restarting the httpd service disables the use of SSL/TLS compression in mod_ssl and the compression will not be negotiated even when connecting client supports it.  Note that this environment variable only affects the use of SSL/TLS protocol compression and does not affect the use of HTTP protocol compression implemented by the mod_deflate module.  The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 are based on upstream version 0.9.7a and do not enable SSL/TLS zlib compression.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-14 14:01:15 UTC  ``` Network Security Services (NSS) library, also used by Mozilla Firefox, does not enable zlib compression by default.  The use of httpd with mod_nss on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 is not affected by this issue.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c8)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-14 20:42:34 UTC  ``` Another interesting writeup:  <http://bridge.grumpy-troll.org/2012/09/tls-crime-beast-and-you-programmer.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-16 16:54:25 UTC  ``` Following CVE ids were assigned to this issue:  [CVE-2012-4929](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4929) - for the SSL/TLS zlib/deflate attack variant [CVE-2012-4930](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4930) - the the SPDY over SSL/TLS connection without compression, now tracked via separate [bug 857737](show_bug.cgi?id=857737 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2012-4930 SPDY: SSL/TLS CRIME attack")   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c10)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-09-24 06:53:21 UTC  ``` Mozilla assigned [CVE-2012-3977](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3977) to the SPDY flaw in Firefox and Seamonkey.  The CVE is being tracked via the [bug #859827](show_bug.cgi?id=859827 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2012-3977 Mozilla: SPDY information disclosure (MFSA 2012-73)").   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c11)  Markus Falb    2012-09-24 11:09:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=857051#c5)) ... > Adding the following line to the /etc/sysconfig/httpd file: >  >   export OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB=1  But there are other services but http that use ssl and are vulnerable?

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

* [qt4-x11](/security/cves?package=qt4-x11) - Qt 4 libraries

## Details

Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered a flaw in the Transport Layer

Security (TLS) protocol when it is used with data compression. If an

attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw

could be exploited to view sensitive information. This update disables

TLS data compression in Qt by default.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libqt4-network](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11)
  -
  [4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11/4%3A4.8.1-0ubuntu4.3)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [libqt4-network](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11)
  -
  [4:4.7.4-0ubuntu8.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11/4%3A4.7.4-0ubuntu8.2)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libqt4-network](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11)
  -
  [4:4.6.2-0ubuntu5.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11/4%3A4.6.2-0ubuntu5.5)

After a standard system update you need to restart any KDE sessions or

applications linked against Qt to make all the necessary changes.

# JVN#65273415 Android OS issue where it is affected by the CRIME attack

## Overview

The implementation of the TLS protocol in Android OS contains a vulnerability where plaintext HTTP headers may be obtained.

## Products Affected

* Android OS versions 4.1.2 and earlier

## Description

The TLS protocol contains a function that compresses data for communications between the client and server. This function does not properly obfuscate the length of the unencrypted data. When this function is enabled on both the client and server, it results in a vulnerability where plaintext HTTP headers may be obtained. The TLS implementation in Android OS is affected by this vulnerability.

Exploiting this vulnerability to obtain plaintext HTTP headers is referred to as the CRIME attack.

## Impact

A man-in-the-middle attacker performing the CRIME attack may obtain plaintext HTTP headers.

## Solution

**Apply an update**

Apply the update according to the information provided by the provider or developer.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0587)

## Topic

Updated openssl packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

It was discovered that OpenSSL leaked timing information when decrypting
TLS/SSL and DTLS protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites
were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain
text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL or DTLS server as a
padding oracle. (CVE-2013-0169)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the OCSP response verification
in OpenSSL. A malicious OCSP server could use this flaw to crash
applications performing OCSP verification by sending a specially-crafted
response. (CVE-2013-0166)

It was discovered that the TLS/SSL protocol could leak information about
plain text when optional compression was used. An attacker able to control
part of the plain text sent over an encrypted TLS/SSL connection could
possibly use this flaw to recover other portions of the plain text.
(CVE-2012-4929)

Note: This update disables zlib compression, which was previously enabled
in OpenSSL by default. Applications using OpenSSL now need to explicitly
enable zlib compression to use it.

It was found that OpenSSL read certain environment variables even when used
by a privileged (setuid or setgid) application. A local attacker could use
this flaw to escalate their privileges. No application shipped with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 was affected by this problem. (BZ#839735)

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect,
all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the
system rebooted.

Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : Multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4557 CVE-2012-4929
Debian Bug     : 689936

A vulnerability has been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:

CVE-2012-4557

	A flaw was found when mod_proxy_ajp connects to a backend
	server that takes too long to respond. Given a specific
	configuration, a remote attacker could send certain requests,
	putting a backend server into an error state until the retry
	timeout expired. This could lead to a temporary denial of
	service.

In addition, this update also adds a server side mitigation for the
following issue:

CVE-2012-4929

	If using SSL/TLS data compression with HTTPS in an connection
	to a web browser, man-in-the-middle attackers may obtain
	plaintext HTTP headers. This issue is known as the "CRIME"
	attack. This update of apache2 disables SSL compression by
	default. A new SSLCompression directive has been backported
	that may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in
	environments where the "CRIME" attack is not an issue.
	For more information, please refer to:
	<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcompression>

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze10.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

More details have emerged of a new attack that allows hackers to hijack encrypted web traffic - such as online banking and shopping protected by HTTPS connections.

The so-called CRIME technique lures a vulnerable web browser into leaking an authentication cookie created when a user starts a secure session with a website. Once the cookie has been obtained, it can be used by hackers to login to the victim's account on the site.

The cookie is deduced by tricking the browser into sending compressed encrypted requests to a HTTPS website and exploiting information inadvertently leaked in the process. Each sent request contains the cookie and some extra data that is tweaked by malicious JavaScript code. The change in size of the sent compressed messages is measured to determine the cookie's contents character by character.

CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy) was created by security researchers Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong, who cooked up the [BEAST SSL exploit](https://www.theregister.com/2011/09/19/beast_exploits_paypal_ssl/) last year. CRIME works on any version of TLS, the underlying technology that protects HTTPS connections. The number of requests an attacker would need to make to pull off the hijack is fairly low - up to six requests per cookie byte. Unlike the BEAST attack, CRIME can't be defeated by configuring the web server to use a different encryption algorithm.

Punters using web browsers that implement either TLS or SPDY compression are potentially at risk - but the vulnerability only comes into play if the victim visits a website that accepts the affected protocols. Support is widespread but far from ubiquitous.

The researchers worked with Mozilla and Google to ensure that both Firefox and Chrome are protected. Microsoft's Internet Explorer is not vulnerable to the attack, and only beta versions of Opera support SPDY. Smartphone browsers and other applications that rely on TLS may be vulnerable, [according to Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/crime-hijacks-https-sessions).

"Basically, the attacker is running a script on Evil.com," Rizzo [explained to Kaspersky Labs' Threatpost](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/crime-attack-uses-compression-ratio-tls-requests-side-channel-hijack-secure-sessions-091312). "He forces the browser to open requests to Bank.com by, for example, adding <img alt=""> tags with the src pointing to Bank.com. Each of those requests contains data from mixed sources."

Each encrypted request includes an image file name - a constantly changing detail that is generated by the malicious script; the browser's identification headers, which don't change; and the login cookie, the target of the attack. When the file name matches part of the login cookie, the size of the message drops because the compression algorithm removes this redundancy.

"The problem is that compression combines all those sources together," Rizzo added. "The attacker can sniff the packets and get the size of the requests that are sent. By changing the [file name] path, he could attempt to minimise the request size, ie: when the file name matches the cookie."

This brute-force attack has been demonstrated against several sites including Dropbox, Github and Stripe. Affected organisations were notified by the pair, and the websites have reportedly suspended support for the leaky encryption compression protocols. Ivan Ristic, director of engineering at Qualys, estimates 42 percent of sites support TLS compression.

The researchers will present their work at the Ekoparty security conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina next week. In the meantime, Jeremiah Grossman, founder and chief technology officer of WhiteHat Security, has a detailed take on the attack [here](http://blog.whitehatsec.com/crime-mitm-and-xss/). ®

# USN-1627-1: Apache HTTP Server vulnerabilities

8 November 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the Apache HTTP server.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [apache2](/security/cves?package=apache2) - Apache HTTP server

## Details

It was discovered that the mod\_negotiation module incorrectly handled

certain filenames, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to

cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server

output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit

this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as

passwords), within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-2687](/security/CVE-2012-2687))

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server was vulnerable to the "CRIME"

SSL data compression attack. Although this issue had been mitigated on the

client with newer web browsers, this update also disables SSL data

compression on the server. A new SSLCompression directive for Apache has

been backported that may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in

certain environments. For more information, please refer to:

<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcompression>

([CVE-2012-4929](/security/CVE-2012-4929))

# CRIME-poc

CRIME attack : a compression oracle attacks [CVE-2012-4929](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2012-4929) discovered by Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong;

> In a compression oracle attack the use of adaptive data compression on a mixture of chosen plaintext and unknown plaintext can result in content-sensitive changes in the length of the compressed text that can be detected even though the content of the compressed text itself is then encrypted. This can be used in protocol attacks to detect when the injected known plaintext is even partially similar to the unknown content of a secret part of the message, greatly reducing the complexity of a search for a match for the secret text. The CRIME and BREACH attacks are examples of protocol attacks using this phenomenon.

The CRIME attack allows you to retrieve encrypted data send by a client to a server using the length of the encrypted data. It does not allow you to retrieve the private key used to encrypt the message or the HTTP request.

3. [Exploit](#exploit)

## Explanation

Many articles explain how the CRIME attack works, but this is the best explanations I found on the internet :

1. [this answer: Crime how to beat the beast successor](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19911/crime-how-to-beat-the-beast-successor/19914#19914)
2. [SSL Attacks Survey from NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.trust/globalassets/our-research/us/whitepapers/ssl_attacks_survey.pdf)

This attack is really not complex, the really interesting part is the implementation that is a bit different from the 'theory'.

Let's check the naive method as described in the article, it's a good way to understand how it works :

The attacker can control request send by the client (using javascript for example). The goal is to retrieve secret cookie. The attacker sends multiple requests like this and check the length of the encrypted data :

| Reques | length |
| --- | --- |
| GET /cookie= DATA cookie=quokkalight | **80** |
| GET /cookie=a DATA cookie=quokkalight | 81 |
| GET /cookie=b DATA cookie=quokkalight | 81 |
| GET /cookie=. DATA cookie=quokkalight | 81 |
| GET /cookie=**q** DATA cookie=quokkalight | **80** |

Since `cookie=q` match `cookie=quokkalight` from the secret cookie, the length of the encrypted data will be the same and the attacker know he found a byte.

But this method failed some times and cannot be trusted so instead we will use another method.
First we send a request with the char we want to find followed by multiple caracters that cannot be found in the initial request like some specials chars :`chr(i) + "#:/[@/&"`. Then we send a second request but we invert the payload like this: `"#:/[@/&" + chr(i)` and we compare the two length. If `len(enc(req1)) < len(enc(req2))` then we found a byte. This method is called: `two_tries` and it's a lot more reliable :

| Request to retrieve byte q | length |
| --- | --- |
| GET /cookie=a~#:/[@/& DATA cookie=quokkalight | 81 |
| GET /cookie=~#:/[@/&a DATA cookie=quokkalight | 81 |
| GET /cookie=b~#:/[@/& DATA cookie=quokkalight | 81 |
| GET /cookie=~#:/[@/&b DATA cookie=quokkalight | 81 |
| GET /cookie=q~#:/[@/& DATA cookie=quokkalight | **80** |
| GET /cookie=~#:/[@/&q DATA cookie=quokkalight | **81** |

The attacker found a byte !

```
if len(enc(request1)) < len(enc(request2)):
    print("found byte")
```

The method `two_tries` I implemented is fully recursive but why ? some time, more than one byte can be found because the compression match with multiple patterns.

Lets take the secret : `cookie=quokkalight`, if we run the algorithm `two_tries` we will found the following result:

```
result 1: cookie=quokie=quokie=quokie=quokie=quokie=
result 2: cookie=quokkalight
```

The algorithm needs to take all the paths in the tree in order to find all the possible solutions.
We can see the all the results as a tree that can be respresented like this:

## Proof Of Concept

### RC4 stream cipher

The proof of concept of CRIME attack against the stream cipher mode can be found in the file : `CRIME-RC4-poc.py`. This is an implementation in python of the previous explanation.

```
python3 CRIME-RC4-poc.py
```

### CBC cipher mode

When CBC cipher mode is used with AES or DES the attack is not as simple as RC4. Since everything is divided in block the attacks is a bit more tricky (not too much).

[![cbc](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a933366ec79ac92eccb151b1459c35cd2dd248961c9e59b71b54ccb90dbb7019/68747470733a2f2f75706c6f61642e77696b696d656469612e6f72672f77696b6970656469612f636f6d6d6f6e732f7468756d622f382f38302f4342435f656e6372797074696f6e2e7376672f36303170782d4342435f656e6372797074696f6e2e7376672e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a933366ec79ac92eccb151b1459c35cd2dd248961c9e59b71b54ccb90dbb7019/68747470733a2f2f75706c6f61642e77696b696d656469612e6f72672f77696b6970656469612f636f6d6d6f6e732f7468756d622f382f38302f4342435f656e6372797074696f6e2e7376672f36303170782d4342435f656e6372797074696f6e2e7376672e706e67)

For example let say we use AES with CBC cipher mode, the block will be devided with a length of 16 and a padding will be added to the end if `len(data)%16 != 0`.
In the mode CBC, it's important to note that the payload `payload=rand` will produce a length of 16 and not 12 since a padding will be add at the end of the data **before** encryption. So our previous attack cannot works.

Example :

| block1 | block2 | block3 | length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET /cookie= DA | TA cookie=quokka | light + PAD(11) | **48** |
| GET /cookie=a DA | TA cookie=quokka | light + PAD(10) | **48** |
| GET /cookie=b DA | TA cookie=quokka | light + PAD(10) | **48** |
| GET /cookie=. DA | TA cookie=quokka | light + PAD(10) | **48** |
| GET /cookie=**q** DA | TA cookie=quokka | light + PAD(11) | **48** |

In this example, the length will be always the same because if we add or remove a byte, the length will always be the same, **only the padding will change**. The attacker only see the encrypted data and he has no way to know the padding using the encrypted data.

Solution: play with the specification of the CBC mode, so the padding length will be 1 by adding random value in the **GARB** variable (in the GET parameter since the attacker control the GET and POST data)

| block1 | block2 | block3 | block4 | length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET /GARBc | ookie= DATA coo | kie=quokkalight + PAD(1) |  | **48** |
| GET /GARBc | ookie=a DATA coo | kie=quokkalight | PAD(16) | 64 |
| GET /GARBc | ookie=b DATA coo | kie=quokkalight | PAD(16) | 64 |
| GET /GARBc | ookie=. DATA coo | kie=quokkalight | PAD(16) | 64 |
| GET /GARBc | ookie=**q** DATA coo | kie=quokkalight + PAD(1) |  | **48** |

If the byte match a pattern, the length will be the same, if it doesn't match, the length will be different.

Next, we just have to use the same method explain in the RC4 part, we just add a step before.

1. we call the function `adjust_padding()` so we can have a padding of length 1
2. we call the function `two_tries_recursive()` and we can find the secret FLAG !

Package        : pound
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-3555 CVE-2012-4929 CVE-2014-3566
Debian Bug     : 723731 727197 765539 765649

Pound, a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, had several issues
related to vulnerabilities in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

For Debian 7 (wheezy) this update adds a missing part to make it
actually possible to disable client-initiated renegotiation and
disables it by default (CVE-2009-3555). TLS compression is disabled
(CVE-2012-4929), although this is normally already disabled by the OpenSSL
system library. Finally it adds the ability to disable the SSLv3 protocol
(CVE-2014-3566) entirely via the new "DisableSSLv3" configuration
directive, although it will not disabled by default in this update.
Additionally a non-security sensitive issue in redirect encoding is
addressed.

For Debian 8 (jessie) these issues have been fixed prior to the release,
with the exception of client-initiated renegotiation (CVE-2009-3555).
This update addresses that issue for jessie.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6-2+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pound packages.

# USN-1898-1: OpenSSL vulnerability

4 July 2013

Applications could be made to expose sensitive information over the
network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier can encrypt compressed data without

properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data, which allows

machine-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext content by observing

length differences during a series of guesses in which a provided string

potentially matches an unknown string in encrypted and compressed traffic.

This is known as a CRIME attack in HTTP. Other protocols layered on top of

TLS may also make these attacks practical.

This update disables compression for all programs using SSL and TLS

provided by the OpenSSL library. To re-enable compression for programs

that need compression to communicate with legacy services, define the

variable OPENSSL\_DEFAULT\_ZLIB in the program's environment.

Researchers have identified a security weakness that allows them to hijack web browser sessions even when they're protected by the HTTPS encryption that banks and e-commerce sites use to prevent snooping on sensitive transactions.

The technique exploits web sessions protected by the Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols when they use one of two data-compression schemes designed to reduce network congestion or the time it takes for webpages to load. Short for Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy, CRIME works only when both the browser and server support [TLS compression](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3749.txt) or [SPDY](http://www.chromium.org/spdy), an open networking protocol used by both Google and Twitter. Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox browsers are all believed to be immune to the attack, but at time of writing smartphone browsers and a myriad of other applications that rely on TLS are believed to remain vulnerable.

CRIME is the latest black eye for the widely used encryption protocols, which act as the Internet's foundation of trust by encrypting traffic that flows over open networks and cryptographically proving websites such as [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) are really operated by Google rather than criminal hackers or state-sponsored spies. The specter of a new attack that could subvert one of the only widely available protections preventing the interception of sensitive e-mails and web transactions, follows revelations that both Iran and China have actively worked to defeat it so they could spy on its citizens.

"The CRIME attack is the nation-state attack," Matthew Green, a professor specializing in cryptography at Johns Hopkins University, told Ars. "It's not something that some hackers are going to do when you're sitting in Starbucks. It's really something that Iran is going to do to try to find dissidents or China is going to do for the same reason. And it's a big deal because of that, especially if Google and Twitter are the ones who are vulnerable."

Representatives from Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft said their companies' browsers are no longer vulnerable to CRIME attacks. Both Chrome and Firefox were susceptible until recently. Google and Mozilla released patches after the weaknesses were privately reported by Juliano Rizzo ([@julianor](https://twitter.com/julianor)) and Thai Duong, the researchers who devised the CRIME exploits. Internet Explorer was never vulnerable because it never supported SPDY (pronounced "speedy") or the TLS compression scheme known as Deflate.

That still leaves open the possibility that a raft of smaller browsers are susceptible. [This webpage](http://caniuse.com/spdy) maintained by self-described "Web tinkerer" and Adobe employee Alexis Deveria says that SPDY is supported in beta versions of Opera and production versions of both Firefox and Chrome for Android, as well as the Android browser.

Apple's Safari browser doesn't support SPDY, but its use of compression is unknown. A representative of Opera said there's no support for compression in the browser and SPDY is available only in beta versions. The status of TLS compression in smaller browsers also remained unknown at time of writing. Rizzo told Ars that encryption schemes used in a variety of chat applications, virtual private networks, and other software may also be vulnerable.

Even when a browser is vulnerable, an HTTPS session can only be hijacked when one of those browsers is used to connect to a site that supports SPDY or TLS compression. The [Qualys SSL Labs page](https://www.ssllabs.com/index.html), which tracks the quality of sites that offer HTTPS protection, shows that services offered by [Google](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.google.com&s=74.125.142.100) and [Twitter](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=twitter.com&s=199.59.150.39) support SPDY. Ivan Ristic, director of engineering at Qualys, told Ars that 42 percent of sites surveyed by his service support TLS compression. A demonstration video taken by Rizzo and Duong on Wednesday shows Github.com, Dropbox.com, and Stripe.com, when visited with a then-patched version of Chrome, succumbing to the CRIME attack, although all three of those sites had disabled compression at time of writing, meaning they are no longer vulnerable.

CRIME vs startups

Both the [GnuTLS](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/) and [OpenSSL](http://openssl.org/) TLS implementations for clients and servers respectively support TLS, making it easy for developers and engineers to fold it into web servers.

## The chosen one

Rizzo and Duong are the architects of a [separate attack from last year that also defeated TLS protection](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/19/beast_exploits_paypal_ssl/). It was dubbed BEAST and was short for Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS). Like that attack, compression-based exploits wield what cryptographers call a chosen plaintext attack on an encrypted session. The technique mixes clear-text data under the control of the attacker with the encrypted payload being targeted. By modifying the clear-text payload hundreds or thousands of times and watching how each one interacts with the encrypted data, an attacker can deduce its contents, usually character by character.

Such attacks can be particularly useful against SSL, since the beginning of each web HTML request contains an authentication cookie with a secret key (which may look something like XS8b1MWZ0QEKJtM1t+QCofRpCsT2u). In a CRIME attack, the encrypted message is combined with attacker-controlled JavaScript that, letter by letter, performs a brute-force attack on the secret key. When it guesses the letter X as the first character of the cookie secret, the encrypted message will appear differently than an encrypted message that uses W or Y. Once the first character is correctly guessed, the attack repeats the process again on the next character in the key until the remainder of the secret is deduced.

Once the session cookie is decrypted, hackers can exploit it to gain unauthorized access to the user account the session cookie is designed to authenticate. The process from start to finish takes "a few minutes," Rizzo said.

Data compression reduces the number of bytes contained in a file or data stream by removing redundant information. CRIME forces a web browser to compress and encrypt requests that contain attacker-controlled data that is combined with the cookie secret. If one of the requests produces fewer encrypted network packets, that's an indication there's more redundancy in the request, and hence the attacker data and the secret data have more information in common. CRIME algorithms decrypt the session cookies by guessing their contents byte by byte. The attacks don't require any browser plugins, and the use of JavaScript isn't necessary, although it does make the brute-force attack faster.

A side effect of compression, security experts have long known, is that it leaks clues about the encrypted contents. That means it provides a "side channel" to adversaries who have the ability to monitor the data. A [research paper published in 2002](http://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/FSE/3091/3091.pdf) by John Kelsey looks eerily similar to CRIME, but only in retrospect.

"I don't think anyone realized that this enables an attack on HTTP over TLS, or that an attacker could learn the value of secret cookies sent over a TLS-encrypted connection," a participant in [this online discussion](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19911/crime-how-to-beat-the-beast-successor/19914#19914) observed. "The paper looks at attacks on compression mainly in the abstract, rather than in the specific context of the web, and is pretty theoretical. So, CRIME (or Thomas Pornin's attack) is still a significant novel extension of these ideas."

("Pornin's attack" is a reference to an exploit described in [this blog post](http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/), where the well-known cryptographer by that name correctly guessed how CRIME worked based on bare-bones clues offered in previous news coverage of the attack. Other speculation that proved to be correct is [here](http://blog.kotowicz.net/2012/09/if-its-crime-than-im-guilty.html).)

## Chain of fools

Last year's BEAST attack worked only against an encryption mode known as cipher block chaining. That limitation allowed engineers to block attacks by using encryption ~~algorithms~~ ciphers such as RC4, which don't rely on the mode. There is no such restriction with compression attacks, so the only known way to block them is to disable TLS compression or apply a SPDY patch that's comparable to the one [recently added to Chrome](https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10825183).

Rizzo and Duong are [scheduled to demonstrate CRIME](http://www.ekoparty.org/2012/juliano-rizzo.php) on September 21 at the Ekoparty security conference in Buenos Aires. Although the attack no longer works on the three most popular browsers to connect to HTTPS-protected websites, CRIME is a potent reminder of the fragility of the protection of encryption. But it likely won't be the last.

"It is easy to try the idea with a short script," Rizzo told Ars. "It's a practical attack against HTTPS and could be a starting point to attack other secure protocols. It's another powerful tool for attackers with access to your network."

*Story updated to add Safari, Opera details, make clear that both Chrome and Firefox were vulnerable until recently.*

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2627-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : nginx
Vulnerability  : information leak
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4929
Debian Bug     : 700426

Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered a weakness in the TLS/SSL
protocol when using compression. This side channel attack, dubbed
'CRIME', allows eavesdroppers to gather information to recover the
original plaintext in the protocol. This update to nginx disables
SSL compression.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.67-3+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.1.16-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.
