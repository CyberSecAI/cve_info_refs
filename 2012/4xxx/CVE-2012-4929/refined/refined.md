Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4929:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2012-4929 lies in the implementation of data compression within the TLS/SSL protocol. Specifically, the vulnerability arises because the compression process does not properly obfuscate the length of the unencrypted data. This allows an attacker to infer information about the plaintext content by observing the size of the compressed output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The core vulnerability is an information leak through the compression side-channel. The size of the compressed data reveals information about the original, uncompressed data.
*   **TLS/SSL Compression:** The weakness stems from the use of compression within the TLS/SSL protocol itself, rather than at a higher level like HTTP compression.
*   **Chosen-Plaintext Attack:** An attacker can leverage the compression weakness by injecting chosen plaintext into the data stream to deduce the content of the target data (e.g., session cookies).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Plaintext Recovery:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to recover plaintext data from the encrypted communication stream.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By recovering authentication cookies, an attacker can potentially hijack a user's active session with a web application, gaining access to sensitive data or functionality.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attack is typically performed by a MitM attacker who can intercept and manipulate network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Proximity:** An attacker needs to be positioned to observe the encrypted traffic between a client and server, making attacks more feasible on local networks or compromised infrastructure.
*   **Javascript Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code on a website to force a victim's browser to repeatedly send requests with crafted data that includes and overlaps the target secret.
*   **Redirection Attacks** Some updates addressed cases where redirects could be used to force requests to a file: URL, which could exfiltrate sensitive information.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation**: Attackers can modify HTTP requests or paths to test different values that could be compressed with the targeted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Eavesdropping:** The attacker must be capable of intercepting and monitoring encrypted TLS/SSL traffic.
*   **Request Injection:** The attacker must be able to inject crafted requests (typically through a compromised web page or similar mechanism) that can be influenced by the attacker.
*   **Server Compatibility:** The target server must be configured to use TLS compression.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy):** This is the name given to this specific type of attack.
*   **Mitigation:** Disabling TLS compression is the primary method of mitigation. This is done both server-side and client side, and many of the updates described in the text involve either disabling compression or providing options to do so.
*   **Browser Specifics:** Some browsers have been patched to mitigate the attack on the client-side, but the vulnerability could still be exploited against applications using vulnerable TLS implementations.
*   **Affected Software:** The content lists various software including OpenSSL, Apache, Qt, and Android OS, as being affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Optimization with Dichotomy:** The attack can be sped up by using a binary search method to determine bytes of the target secret.

In summary, CVE-2012-4929 represents a serious vulnerability that arises from the way TLS/SSL handles data compression. Its impact can range from information exposure to complete session hijacking. The mitigations involve disabling compression, and affected services need to be updated with specific patches.
