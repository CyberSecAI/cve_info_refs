Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way LINE for Android handles implicit intents. Implicit intents do not specify the component which should handle it, allowing other applications to intercept and process it if they can handle the specified action. The lack of proper handling in LINE for Android allows malicious apps to potentially intercept these intents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of implicit intents.
- Lack of sufficient security measures to protect sensitive information passed through implicit intents.
- Design error, as the initial design of the application did not adequately protect against the risks of handling implicit intents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leakage: Sensitive information, including messages sent through LINE, can be leaked to a malicious third-party application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious application: A malicious application installed on the same device as LINE can intercept implicit intents broadcast by the LINE app.
- Network: Although the primary vector is a malicious application, the attack can be initiated via network-based actions (e.g. tricking a user to install a malicious app).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create and deploy a malicious application onto the target device.
- The malicious application needs to be able to register itself as a handler for the implicit intents that LINE broadcasts.
- The user needs to be tricked into installing the malicious application.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is classified as a design error by IPA.
- The CVSS v2 score for the vulnerability is low, due to high access complexity, meaning the user needs to be tricked into installing a malicious application.
