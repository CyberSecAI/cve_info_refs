# Java 0Day and the Targeted Nitro Attacks Campaign Analysis

[03/09/2012](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/09/03/java-0day-and-the-targeted-nitro-attacks-campaign-analysis/ "Permalink to Java 0Day and the Targeted Nitro Attacks Campaign Analysis")[Reverse Engineering](https://eromang.zataz.com/category/reverse-engineering/)[APT](https://eromang.zataz.com/tag/apt/), [China](https://eromang.zataz.com/tag/china/), [Java](https://eromang.zataz.com/tag/java/), [Oracle](https://eromang.zataz.com/tag/oracle/)[wow](https://eromang.zataz.com/author/admin/ "View all posts by wow")

[Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/java-zero-day-used-targeted-attack-campaign), [Kaspersky Labs](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/use-java-zero-day-flaws-tied-nitro-attack-crew-083012), [Trend Micro](http://blog.trendmicro.com/the-nitro-campaign-and-java-zero-day), [Sophos](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/08/30/zero-day-java-flaw-exploited-tax-email/) and other security vendors continue to surf on the [Java 0day targeted attack stuff](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/08/27/oracle-java-0day-and-the-myth-of-a-targeted-attack/ "Oracle Java 0day and the Myth of a Targeted Attack").

The vendors have agreed, in communion, that Java 0day was potentially used by the Chinese Nitro gang, through spear-phishing campaign. Nitro gang is well-known since another targeted campaign in 2011, [reported by Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the_nitro_attacks.pdf), focusing on organizations in the United States, Bangladesh and U.K.

Nitro gang, potentially the source of the newly discovered Java 0day, is using IP addresses and other characteristics that were common from the 2011 targeted attack, like the same C&C (*223.25.233.244* for example) and the same files (“*Flash\_update.exe*” for example).

For Kaspersky Labs, “*the attacks have been going on for more than a week*“. For Symantec, “*the attackers have been using this zero-day for several days since August 22*“. For Trend Micro, “*Nitro attackers were continuing to send out emails to their targets with direct links to Poison Ivy executables in early August 2012*“.

As all the vendors agree on the time frame and the source of the attack, we will take a  look on all information’s we can gather around this story.

#### First C&C server

The first known C&C was “*223.25.233.244*“, also used in the 2011 campaign. I reported in [my previous blog post](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/08/27/oracle-java-0day-and-the-myth-of-a-targeted-attack/ "Oracle Java 0day and the Myth of a Targeted Attack"), that the IP address was well-known since many months. As you will see here under the C&c server is well-known, dropping lot of malwares, with various domain names.

***All information’s gathered on this C&C server:***

#### First reported infected server

The first reported infected server was “*ok.aa24.net*” with “*59.120.154.62*” IP address. The related infection URL was “*ok.XXXX.net/meeting/index.html*” with malicious loaded “*applet.jar*“. The IP address is located in Singapore. I also reported, in [my previous blog post](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/08/27/oracle-java-0day-and-the-myth-of-a-targeted-attack/ "Oracle Java 0day and the Myth of a Targeted Attack"), that the IP address was well known since many months.

#### Second reported infected server

The second reported, by [Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/java-zero-day-used-targeted-attack-campaign) the 30 August, infected server was “*62.152.104.149*“. The related infection URL was “*62.152.104.XXX/public/meeting/index.html*” with malicious loaded “*applet.jar*“. The IP address is located in Italia.

Until the 30 August, “[*index.html*](http://pastebin.com/t5eqSvBF)” file, present on the second infected server, was an obfuscated JavaScript charging the malicious Java 0day “*applet.jar*” aka “*cve2012xxxx.Gondvv.class*” and the Poison Ivy backdoor “*Flash\_update.exe*“. The “index.html” file was part of Gondad exploit kit, like as for the first infected server.

[URL Query](http://urlquery.net/report.php?id=144237) report that “*62.152.104.149*” is known since the 2012-08-24 with the same malicious URL. The date is corresponding on the “*Last modified*” date reported by the infected server. All the files have the 2012-08-24 date, except “*1.php*“.

[![Screenshot taken the 29 August](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/62.152.104.149-08-24-300x209.png "62.152.104.149-08-24")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/62.152.104.149-08-24.png)

Screenshot taken the 29 August

If you browse the server indexed directories, you can find a Rhino exploit “[*index.jar*](http://pastebin.com/F2RPMCj3)“, how is available since 2012-03-16.

[![Screenshot taken the 29 August](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/62.152.104.149-Rhino-300x78.png "62.152.104.149-Rhino")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/62.152.104.149-Rhino.png)

Screenshot taken the 29 August

I you continue to browse the directories, you can also find CVE-2010-3856 Linux exploit “[*glibc.sh*](http://pastebin.com/fGLSinAQ)“, used to backdoor the server. These files date are 2011-11-29.

[![Screenshot taken the 29 August](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/62.152.104.149-CVE-2010-3856-300x143.png "62.152.104.149-CVE-2010-3856")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/62.152.104.149-CVE-2010-3856.png)

Screenshot taken the 29 August

As you have seen, all the screenshots were taken the 29 August. I have monitor the server and the files present in the “*/public/meeting*” directory have change the 30 August, with a new variant of “*[applet.jar](http://pastebin.com/zQZzMswr)*” and some new files like “*feq.html*” ([VirusTotal analysis](https://www.virustotal.com/file/ad4be10dd6bf98a510b1d2f46648e588f49fef8de3cd8522ad7fd3d0915b5c08/analysis/1346421492/) / [Malwr.com analysis](http://malwr.com/analysis/265f46c572f4e5a3b17d39cb74f01e15/)). Malwr.com analysis reported a new C&C server aka “*12.163.32.15*“, how is actually down.

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/62.152.104.149-variant-300x176.png "62.152.104.149-variant")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/62.152.104.149-variant.png)

#### **KB2690533.exe C&C dropped binary**

The 20 August “*KB2690533.exe*” file was dropped, from the C&C server, and we can find some additional information’s regarding the file name.

**2012-08-16** – URL Query Analysis ([133150](http://urlquery.net/report.php?id=133150)): Analyzed URL was “*http://erp.claridy.com.tw/rndy/download.war/KB2690533.exe*” aka “*211.72.230.236*“.

**2012-08-17** – [Cisco Threat Outbreak Alert](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewThreatOutbreakAlert.x?alertId=26673): “significant activity related to spam e-mail messages that claim to contain a Security Update for the recipient”. What mean significant ? The spam e-mail message text is looking similar to the spam e-mail message reported by [Trend Micro](http://blog.trendmicro.com/the-nitro-campaign-and-java-zero-day) the 30 August. Coincidence, we will see that it is not a coincidence.

> Subject: **Security Update**
>
> Message Body:
>
> **Dear,
>
> Because of the office network interfaces changed.Please download the Security Update fot windows XP (KB2690533),and install it. Download address: hxxp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/KB2690533.exe**

Also the [following Chinese web](http://www.sacour.cn/list/2012-8/2012821.htm) site is reporting some URLs the 2012-08-21 and we can find “*http://erp.claridy.com.tw/rndy/download.war/KB2690533.exe*“, “*http://erp.claridy.com.tw/rndy/download.war/Flash\_update.exe*” and “*http://haitimissionschool.org/updateflashplayer.exe*“.

#### Spam e-email message reported by Trend Micro

In his [blog post](http://blog.trendmicro.com/the-nitro-campaign-and-java-zero-day) Trend Micro is reporting some typical spam e-mail message with direct links to Poison Ivy executable in early August 2012.

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/javanitro1-300x222.jpg "javanitro1")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/javanitro1.jpg)

As you can see this email message is in the same style as the message detected by Cisco the 17 August.

If we search on the username string “*alcoauser*“, we can find some additional information’s:

**2012-08-02** – Another [Cisco Threat Outbreak Alert](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewThreatOutbreakAlert.x?alertId=26543): “*significant activity related to spam e-mail messages*” with exactly the same content as the content provided by Trend Micro and we can find the “*59.120.154.62*” server where the 0day was discovered.

#### Other e-mail message spotted by a Chinese website

In his [blog post](http://blog.trendmicro.com/the-nitro-campaign-and-java-zero-day) Trend Micro is reporting [another e-email](http://blog.martinoei.com/2012/04/%E4%B8%AD%E5%85%B1%E5%91%A2%E7%8F%ADhihi%E6%83%B3%E7%8E%A9%E5%98%A2%E7%8E%A9%E5%88%B0%E5%B9%BE%E6%99%82%EF%BC%9F/) how was spotted in April 2012.

> *Dear,

> [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)*

This e-mail message is in the same style as the previous e-mail messages. The malicious URL was “*http://out.hzlo.net/update/upgrade.exe*” with IP address “*71.216.92.29*“. This domain name and IP address were first spotted by [ScumWare.org](http://www.scumware.org/report/71.216.92.29)the 30 March. Another additional domain name was reported “*http://adobe.flash-mail.tk/update/Flash\_updata.exe*” on the same server the 24 April.

“*out.hzlo.net*” domain name was spotted by 04 April by [Clean MX realtime database](http://support.clean-mx.com/clean-mx/viruses.php?domain=hzlo.net&sort=id%20desc), but if you take a look on the complete “*\*.hzlo.net*” domain names, you can see that “*http://jack.hzlo.net/download/antivirus.exe*” was catched the 23 February !

More interesting, the characteristic of the Java 0day spreading was URL like “*/public/meeting/index.html*” or “*/meeting/index.html*“. Clean MX realtime database report this URL for the first time for “*http://jack.hzlo.net/meeting/index.html*” the 02 July.

#### Conclusion

If they’re was an active targeted Nitro campaign, this campaign has start during February 2012 with different infection vectors. The campaign has been catched many times by different security researchers and vendors, but nobody has raise the alert flag until end of August. I think that nobody has care on the pseudo earlier catched “targeted” campaign, and that the Java 0day was the alert flag.

Second opinion, I really think that the Java 0day was out for a minimum of 2 or 3 months before his public discovery.

And last but not least opinion, I still continue to believe that it was not so targeted as the vendors try to make us believe.

# Zero-Day Season Is Really Not Over Yet

[16/09/2012](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/09/16/zero-day-season-is-really-not-over-yet/ "Permalink to Zero-Day Season Is Really Not Over Yet")[Exploits](https://eromang.zataz.com/category/exploits/), [Reverse Engineering](https://eromang.zataz.com/category/reverse-engineering/)[Adobe](https://eromang.zataz.com/tag/adobe/), [Flash](https://eromang.zataz.com/tag/flash/), [Microsoft](https://eromang.zataz.com/tag/microsoft/), [Windows](https://eromang.zataz.com/tag/windows/)[wow](https://eromang.zataz.com/author/admin/ "View all posts by wow")

I can confirm, the zero-day season is really not over yet. Less than three weeks after the discovery of the [Java SE 7 0day](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/09/03/java-0day-and-the-targeted-nitro-attacks-campaign-analysis/ "Java 0Day and the Targeted Nitro Attacks Campaign Analysis"), aka [CVE-2012-4681](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/08/30/cve-2012-4681-vulnerability-patched-in-out-of-band-oracle-java-update/ "CVE-2012-4681 Vulnerability Patched in Out-of-Band Oracle Java Update"), potentially used by the Nitro gang in targeted attacks, a potential Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 and 8 zero-day is actually exploited in the wild.

First I would like to thanks the nice people ([@binjo](https://twitter.com/binjo), [@\_sinn3r](https://twitter.com/_sinn3r) and all the guys of the [Metasploit](http://www.metasploit.com/) IRC channel on freenode) how helped me to understand and go further in my investigations.

Second, I would like to clarify some points:

* I wasn’t a target of the 0day, I tested it on my lab. This misunderstanding has been introduced by Reuters in their press release.
* I did these researches on my personal time, and these researches are not linked with my professional activities. This misunderstanding has been introduced by Reuters in their press release.
* I don’t pin the responsibility on the Nitro gang, if you read my blog post, you will see that I found coincidences.
* I don’t know the timeline of the vulnerability, including when it was discovered and how long it has been exploited.

Since the release of the Java SE 7 0day I was monitoring some of the infected servers used by the alleged Nitro gang (take a look at the updates at the end of the blog post). The 14th September morning, I discovered a “*/public/help*” folder on one of these servers, the Italian one (smile to [@PhysicalDrive0](https://es.twitter.com/PhysicalDrive0)).

As seen in the following screenshot, 4 files were hosted in this folder, and as a curious man, I downloaded everything to see what was related to these files.

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-20120914-300x215.png "Moh2010-0day-20120914")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-20120914.png)

I tested these files on an up-to-date Microsoft Windows XP Pro SP3 with an up-to-date Adobe Flash (11,4,402,265). Surprise they dropped files on my test computer (See demonstration video here under) ! A new 0day ?  I decide then to take a deeper look at the grabbed files.

#### exploit.html

This file is recognized as an HTML file, and catched by 0 anti-viruses on VirusTotal ([9d66323794d493a1deaab66e36d36a820d814ee4dd50d64cddf039c2a06463a5](https://www.virustotal.com/file/9d66323794d493a1deaab66e36d36a820d814ee4dd50d64cddf039c2a06463a5/analysis/1347710777/)).

“*exploit.html*” is the entry point of the attack. This file creates an array of “*img*” and load “*Moh2010.swf*” Flash file.

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/exploit-html-300x103.png "exploit-html")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/exploit-html.png)

#### Moh2010.swf

This file is recognized as a Macromedia Flash Player movie, and catched by 0 anti-viruses on VirusTotal ([70f6a2c2976248221c251d9965ff2313bc0ed0aebb098513d76de6d8396a7125](https://www.virustotal.com/file/70f6a2c2976248221c251d9965ff2313bc0ed0aebb098513d76de6d8396a7125/analysis/1347710461/)).

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-swf-frame.png "Moh2010-0day-swf-frame")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-swf-frame.png)

You can observe that the file is packed by [DoSWF](http://www.doswf.com) and that it is decompress in the memory. After decompression “*Moh2010.swf*” file is spraying the heap and eval an iframe to “*Protect.html*” file.

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-DOSWF-encryption-300x12.png "Moh2010-0day-DOSWF-encryption")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-DOSWF-encryption.png)

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-Protect-html-iframe-300x17.png "Moh2010-0day-Protect-html-iframe")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-Protect-html-iframe.png)

The [ActionScript embedded](http://pastebin.com/wEYtDvm8) in the original packed SWF file, is also interesting, you will see some special encoding (Chinese ?).

Decoded SWF file, is known as “Exploit:SWF/[CVE-2010-2884](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2884).B”, or “SWF:Dropper” on VirusTotal ([dd41efa629c7f7f876362c5ca6d570be6b83728a2ce8ecbef65bdb89cb402b0f](https://www.virustotal.com/file/dd41efa629c7f7f876362c5ca6d570be6b83728a2ce8ecbef65bdb89cb402b0f/analysis/1347785233/)) and detected only by 3/34 anti-viruses. Thanks to binjo.

This file, during exploitation is also checking if the web site is present in [*Flash Website Storage Settings pannel*](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html) to no more load the “*Protect.html*” file. This mean, that once infected the user will no more be exploited despite further visites to the web site.

#### Protect.html

This file is recognized as an HTML file, and catched by 0 anti-viruses on VirusTotal ([2a2e2efffa382663ba10c492f407dda8a686a777858692d073712d1cc9c5f265](https://www.virustotal.com/file/2a2e2efffa382663ba10c492f407dda8a686a777858692d073712d1cc9c5f265/analysis/1347710701/)).

If you take a look at the source code, you can see interesting javascript code, how is manipulating the “*img*” array created by “*exploit.html*“.

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/protect-html-1-300x116.png "protect-html-1")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/protect-html-1.png)

You will also see that tests are done, in order to target Windows XP 32-bit and Internet Explorer 7 or 8.

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/protect-html-2-300x194.png "protect-html-2")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/protect-html-2.png)

#### 111.exe

This file is recognized as a Autodesk FLIC image file, and catched by 0 anti-viruses on VirusTotal ([a5a04f661781d48df3cbe81f56ea1daae6ba3301c914723b0bb6369a5d2505d9](https://www.virustotal.com/file/a5a04f661781d48df3cbe81f56ea1daae6ba3301c914723b0bb6369a5d2505d9/analysis/1347710327/)).

Submitted to Malware Tracker ([baabd0b871095138269cf2c53b517927](https://www.malwaretracker.com/docsearch.php?hash=baabd0b871095138269cf2c53b517927)), this file look like suspicious and require further investigations. “*111.exe*” is packed and after decoding the file is still not detected by any anti-virus on VirusTotal ([a6086c16136ea752fc49bc987b8cc9e494384f372ddfdca85c2a5b7d43daa812](https://www.virustotal.com/file/a6086c16136ea752fc49bc987b8cc9e494384f372ddfdca85c2a5b7d43daa812/analysis/)). But with a [Malwr analysis](http://malwr.com/analysis/7173d9b331275b8be69a4e698c9ec68f/), you can see that this file is recognized as installing a program to run automatically at logon.

#### Conclusion

The guys how developed this new 0day were not happy to have been catched, they just removed all the files from the source server 2 days after my discovery. But also more interesting the also removed a Java 0day variant from other folders.

[![](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-20120916-300x161.png "Moh2010-0day-20120916")](https://eromang.zataz.com/wp-content/uploads/Moh2010-0day-20120916.png)

Also I submitted all these stuff to different person in order to confirm the strangeness of this exploit, and we got some good return.

> Confirmed [@eromang](https://twitter.com/eromang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and [@binjo](https://twitter.com/binjo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) are right about the bug. Not Adobe, appears to be IE: <http://t.co/5lA7y33I>

#### Updates

**Sunday 09/16:**

Metasploit team is planning to release an exploit module on Monday. This module seems to work very well.

> As [@EdiStrosar](https://twitter.com/EdiStrosar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) predicted, yes, [@\_juan\_vazquez\_](https://twitter.com/_juan_vazquez_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and I r working on it, and looks good so far:<http://t.co/bi1TIm9q> /cc [@eromang](https://twitter.com/eromang?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) & [@binjo](https://twitter.com/binjo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

**Monday 09/17:**

Metasploit [has release an exploit module “*ie\_execcommand\_uaf*“](https://eromang.zataz.com/2012/09/17/microsoft-internet-explorer-execcommand-vulnerability-metasploit-demo/ "Microsoft Internet Explorer execCommand Vulnerability Metasploit Demo") and this module is working for IE 7/8/9 on XP/Vista/7.

AlienVault Labs has provide some [additional information s](http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/new-internet-explorer-zero-day-being-exploited-in-the-wild/) regarding DoSWF file and the C&C server aka “*12.163.32.15*“.

Microsoft has release [MSA-2757760](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2757760) and recommend to install [EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) 3.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29851) and other mitigation solutions.

**Tuesday 09/18:**

AlienVault Labs has provide [more details](http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/the-connection-between-the-plugx-chinese-gang-and-the-latest-internet-explorer-zeroday/) on the potential source of the attack.

> It seems the guys behind this 0day were targeting specific industries. We’ve seen that they compromised a news site related to the defense industry and they created a fake domain related to LED technologies that can be used to perform spearphishing campaigns to those industries.

**Wednesday 09/19:**

AlienVault Labs [has report variant](http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/new-versions-of-the-iexplorer-zeroday-emerge-targeting-defence-and-industrial-companies/) of the “*Protect.html*” file, named “*Dodge.html*” how is now also infecting Windows 7 32 bits running Java6 with Internet Explorer 9, and confirm the usage of the 0day in targeted attacks.

Microsoft propose a **[Fix it KB2757760](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2757760)** solution, “*Prevent Memory Corruption via ExecCommand in Internet Explorer*“, that prevents exploitation of this issue.

Microsoft has publish an advanced notification “[*Microsoft Security Bulletin Advance Notification for September 2012*](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-sep)” for one out-of-band security bulletin that Microsoft is intending to release on September 21, 2012. The bulletin will addresses security vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability is also affecting Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and 2008.

**Friday 09/21:**

Microsoft has release the promised update [MS12-063](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/MS12-063) in order to fix the 0day vulnerability. If you use Internet Explorer, I advice you to update as soon as possible !

     Why no AV on your test VM? Also noticed Win was showing update icon in systray.

        Hi 305Vic,

        I test without AV because most of time the payload is them blocked. The objective is to test the complete chain.

        My latest Windows update was from begin September, and Microsoft didn’t release any Internet Explorer update on September Black Tuesday.

        Also the 0day is confirmed by the guys of Metasploit, and they have develop a module how will be available on Monday. <http://postimage.org/image/zf4qdbmuf/>

#### **Commands :**

```
use exploit/windows/browser/ie_execcommand_uaf

   I have tried using this JRE ROP after installing JRE version 1.5.0.50 on windows 7 machine. However The exploit does not seems to be working for me. Please note I have used some wild samples not the POC. This address 0x7c37653d appears to be unknown. Getting access violation. Could some one tell me what am i doing wrong here?

Security Bulletin

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-063 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (2744842)

Published: September 21, 2012

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and four privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, and Internet Explorer 9 on Windows clients and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, and Internet Explorer 9 on Windows servers. Internet Explorer 10 is not affected. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2757760](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2757760).

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## OnMove Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1529

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object in memory that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1529](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1529).

#### Mitigating Factors for OnMove Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1529

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248).

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.

  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.

These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for OnMove Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1529

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object in memory that has not been initialized or has been deleted, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a website for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Event Listener Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2546

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object in memory that has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-2546](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-2546).

#### Mitigating Factors for Event Listener Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2546

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248).

## cloneNode Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2557

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object in memory that has been deleted. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-2557](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-2557).

#### Mitigating Factors for cloneNode Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2557

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for cloneNode Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2557

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **Setup Modes** |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| **Restart Options** |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| **Special Options** |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

## Microsoft Internet Explorer 6/7/8/9 contain a use-after-free vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#480095

Original Release Date: 2012-09-17 | Last Revised: 2012-09-21

---

### Overview

Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, 8, and 9 are susceptible to a use-after-free vulnerability ([CWE-416](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)) that may result in remote code execution.

### Description

| Microsoft Internet Explorer 6/7/8/9 contains a use-after-free vulnerability in the CMshtmlEd::Exec() function. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild and a Metasploit module is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  Run [Windows Update](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=40747) to apply the patch for this vulnerability. [MS12-063](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/Bulletin/MS12-063) contains patches for this and other vulnerabilities as well.If you cannot apply the update for whatever reason, please consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Apply a Microsoft Fix It utility**Microsoft has released [Microsoft Fix it 50939](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2757760) to address this vulnerability. The Fix It utility requires that all previous Windows security updates are installed to function properly.**Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29851) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this and other vulnerabilities.**Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows**Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: [On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx) for more details.The [MSRC blog post](http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2012/09/17/microsoft-releases-security-advisory-2757760.aspx) lists the following mitigations for this vulnerability.     + *Set Internet and local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones*   - *This will help prevent exploitation but may affect usability; therefore, trusted sites should be added to the Internet Explorer Trusted Sites zone to minimize disruption.* + *Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and local intranet security zones*   - *This will help prevent exploitation but can affect usability, so trusted sites should be added to the Internet Explorer Trusted Sites zone to minimize disruption.*  **Use a different web browser**Until Microsoft has released a patch for this vulnerability, consider using a different web browser for viewing untrusted web sites. |
