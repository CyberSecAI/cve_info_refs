Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-4969:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** condition that exists in the `CMshtmlEd::Exec()` function within Microsoft Internet Explorer.
*   This occurs when the `CMshtmlEd` object is unexpectedly deleted, but the memory it occupied is later reused in the `CMshtmlEd::Exec()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is accessing freed memory, which can lead to corruption and exploitable conditions.
*   The vulnerability exists specifically in the `execCommand` functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the same privileges as the user running Internet Explorer.
*   This could lead to a complete takeover of the system if the user has administrative rights, allowing the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker hosts a malicious website that exploits the vulnerability when visited by a user running an affected version of Internet Explorer.
*   **Spear Phishing/Social Engineering:** Attackers convince users to visit a malicious website through links embedded in emails, instant messages, or other means.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers inject malicious code into compromised websites, which then exploit visitors who are running vulnerable versions of Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior access or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific vulnerability and how to exploit it, though public exploits (like Metasploit modules) make this much easier.
*   **Delivery Mechanism:** The attacker requires a method to get the user to access the malicious HTML content.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when rendering an HTML page, specifically when the `CMshtmlEd` object gets deleted unexpectedly during the page loading.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited through specially crafted HTML pages containing Flash (.swf) files with embedded javascript code, using techniques such as heap spraying and iframe injection to trigger the use after free in the `execCommand` function.
*   The vulnerability is known to affect Internet Explorer 7, 8, and 9 on Windows XP, Vista, and 7.
*   A Metasploit module (`ie_execcommand_uaf`) was released to facilitate exploitation, which indicates a readily available attack tool.
*   The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild before a patch was released by Microsoft.
*   A Microsoft Fix It solution ("Prevent Memory Corruption via ExecCommand in Internet Explorer") was released as a workaround before the patch, confirming the specific exploit location.

**Mitigations**

The content also contains mitigation advice:
*   Using the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)
*   Applying the Microsoft Fix it utility
*   Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting
*   Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone
*   Using an alternative browser until patched
*   Enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and use of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is important
