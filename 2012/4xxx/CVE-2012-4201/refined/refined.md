  "CVE-2012-4201": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `evalInSandbox` implementation in Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey uses an incorrect context during the handling of JavaScript code that sets the `location.href` property.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect context usage in `evalInSandbox` when handling JavaScript code that sets `location.href`, leading to a bypass of the sandbox's JavaScript context.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or read arbitrary files by leveraging a sandboxed add-on.",
    "Attack vectors": "Leveraging a sandboxed add-on with vulnerable JavaScript code in Firefox, Thunderbird or SeaMonkey.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker must be able to inject malicious JavaScript code that uses `evalInSandbox` to set `location.href` within a vulnerable add-on."
