Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-4823:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure usage of the `java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass()` method within the IBM Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This method is responsible for loading a class definition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Execution:**  The insecure usage of `defineClass()` allows for arbitrary Java code execution. 
*   **Security Sandbox Bypass:** This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the Java security sandbox restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Java code on the target system. This could potentially lead to complete compromise of the system.
*   **System Compromise:** By bypassing the sandbox, an attacker can potentially gain full control of the system, steal data, disrupt services, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Web Sites:** Attackers can persuade users to visit a malicious website that contains a specially crafted Java applet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be an unauthenticated remote user.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade a user to visit a malicious website hosting a malicious applet.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability is specific to IBM's implementation of Java SE technology.
*   The vulnerability is applicable to Java deployments where untrusted code may be executed under a security manager (e.g. Java applets in a web browser).
*   The provided content shows this vulnerability, along with others, was fixed in IBM Java SE 6 SR12 and IBM Java SE 7 SR3 releases.
*   It also notes that Red Hat has issued updates to address this and other related vulnerabilities (e.g. RHSA-2012:1466, RHSA-2012:1467, RHSA-2013:1455, RHSA-2013:1456)
* The provided content also mentions that this is not a duplicate of previously reported vulnerabilities in Oracle's Java SE.

The provided information is more detailed than the basic CVE description. It outlines the specific method, `defineClass()`, that is at fault and specifies that this vulnerability is in the IBM implementation of Java. It also clarifies the method of attack involving malicious Java applets on a web page.
