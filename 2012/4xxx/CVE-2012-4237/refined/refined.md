Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-4237

**Description:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Software:** TCExam version 11.3.007 (and potentially prior versions)
*   **Vulnerable Files:** `tce_edit_answer.php` and `tce_edit_question.php`

**Root Cause:**

*   The `subject_module_id` parameter within the vulnerable files is directly passed into a SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize the `subject_module_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This is a classic SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** While the vulnerability requires an authenticated user with a permission level of 5 or higher, this still represents a significant attack surface since such users have authoring permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Control:** An attacker can inject SQL queries to gain full control over the database.
*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can retrieve sensitive data, such as user credentials (including admin password hashes) from the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating database records, an attacker can escalate their privileges to gain administrative access.
*   **Host Compromise:** The advisory suggests that further compromise of the host machine is possible by leveraging the SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to either `tce_edit_answer.php` or `tce_edit_question.php`.
*   **Manipulated `subject_module_id` Parameter:** The SQL injection is achieved by crafting a malicious payload within the `subject_module_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user of the TCExam application.
*   **Permission Level:** The attacker must have a minimum permission level of 5 within the application, which grants authoring permissions.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Example Payload:** The provided example demonstrates how to extract the admin password hash:
    ```sql
    999999.9 union all select (select
    concat(0x7e,0x27,tce_users.user_password,0x27,0x7e) from `tcexam`.tce_users
    where tce_users.user_name = CHAR(97,100,109,105,110) limit 0,1)
    ,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0--
    ```
*   **Example HTTP Request:**
    ```
    GET
    /TCExam/admin/code/tce_edit_answer.php?subject_module_id=999999.9+union+all+
    select+%28select+concat%280x7e%2C0x27%2Ctce_users.user_password%2C0x27%2C0x7
    e%29+from+%60tcexam%60.tce_users+where+tce_users.user_name+%3d+CHAR(97,100,1
    09,105,110)+limit+0%2C1%29+%2C0x0%2C0x0%2C0x0%2C0x0%2C0x0--&question_subject
    _id=3&answer_question_id=7 HTTP/1.1
    ```
*   **Response Extraction:** The extracted data is then embedded within the HTML output of the page.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade:** The recommended solution is to upgrade to TCExam version 11.3.008, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The advisory was released by Reaction Information Security.
* The vulnerability was fixed on the same day the vendor was notified.
* The advisory includes a link to a blog post with further information.
