  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and lack of checks on return values of functions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Code execution via function pointer manipulation (A, B, C)",
        "Stack overflow due to insufficient buffer size (D)",
        "Directory traversal via insecure file access (E)",
        "Arbitrary memory write via manipulated file pointers (F)",
        "Arbitrary byte write via negative reallocation size (G)"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution, arbitrary file read/write, denial of service. Specifically:\n\tA, B, C: Remote code execution by controlling function pointers.\n\tD: Stack overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\tE: Arbitrary file read by traversing directories.\n\tF: Possible arbitrary code execution if the attacker can overcome the obstacles.\n\tG: Arbitrary byte write, potentially leading to other exploits.",
      "attack_vectors": "Network based, by sending specially crafted TCP packets to the server application listening on port 46824.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to send crafted network packets to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed for exploitation"
