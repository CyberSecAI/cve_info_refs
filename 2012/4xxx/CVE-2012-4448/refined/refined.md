Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4448:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of parameters when registering dashboard widgets for the "incoming links" widget in WordPress. This allows for manipulation of the RSS feed URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The primary weakness is the susceptibility to CSRF attacks. WordPress fails to adequately validate the origin of requests made to modify the incoming links widget settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject a malicious RSS feed URL into the "incoming links" section of a WordPress dashboard. This could allow them to redirect the administrator to a malicious site or potentially lead to further exploitation. Specifically, the provided exploit changes the URL of the feed for the incoming links section of the dashboard.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out through a specially crafted web page.
- A logged-in WordPress administrator visiting the malicious web page unknowingly triggers the vulnerable request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML page containing a form that sends a POST request to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to lure a logged-in WordPress administrator to visit this malicious page, thus exploiting the CSRF vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the WordPress admin panel.

**Technical Details from the provided resources:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a POST request to `wp-admin/index.php` with the `edit=dashboard_incoming_links` action.
- The malicious form includes hidden input fields that modify the `widget-rss[1][url]` value, thereby changing the RSS feed URL in the dashboard widget settings.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher named 'Akastep'.
- The issue is confirmed in WordPress version 3.4.2.
- Upstream has confirmed that this issue was fixed in version 3.5.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker could change the dashboard link using a hidden form in an HTML page.
