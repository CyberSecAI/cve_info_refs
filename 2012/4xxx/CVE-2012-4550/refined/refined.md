{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in the implementation logic of the JACC workflow resulted in the authorization being incorrectly configured and wrongly delegated.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The configured authorization modules (JACC, XACML, etc.) were not called, and the JACC permissions were not used to determine access to an EJB.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could circumvent access controls on web services exposed via Apache CXF.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote, through web services.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker would need to transmit malicious requests to web services."
