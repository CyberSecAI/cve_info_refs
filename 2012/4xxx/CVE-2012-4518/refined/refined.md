Subject: Re: CVE Request -- librdmacm (one issue) / ibacm (two
 issues)

Issue #3 ibacm - ib_acm service files created with world writable
 permissions (DoS):
 ====================================================================================
 A security flaw was found in the way ibacm, an InfiniBand communication
 manager assistant, created files used by ib_acm service - they were created
 with world writable permissions. A local attacker could use this
 flaw to 1) overwrite content of ib_acm daemon log file or 2)
 overwrite content of ib_acm daemon ibacm.port file (ability to mask
 certain actions or cause ib_acm to run on non-default port).

 Please use CVE-2012-4518 for this issue.
```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ibacm` daemon creates service files with world-writable permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure file permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - A local attacker can overwrite the content of the `ib_acm` daemon log file, potentially masking malicious activity.
    - A local attacker can overwrite the content of the `ib_acm` daemon `ibacm.port` file, potentially forcing the daemon to run on a non-default port.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to be able to modify files.
