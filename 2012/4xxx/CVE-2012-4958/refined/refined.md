Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `read_file_sub_409FA0` function of the `NFRAgent.exe` component in Novell File Reporter. This function handles requests on the `/FSF/CMD` endpoint for records with `NAME` set to `FSFUI` and `UICMD` set to `126`.
- The function retrieves a file path from the `FILE` tag within the XML request. This path is then used in a call to `fopen` to open the file in read-binary mode (`"rb"`).
- There are two attempts to open the file: first using the path directly from the FILE tag and second with a relative path if the first attempt fails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary File Read:** The application allows an unauthenticated user to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. The file path is taken directly from the user-supplied XML, and is used to open and read the file contents.
- **Path Traversal:** The code allows relative paths to be specified via the FILE tag, which enables directory traversal attacks.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerable endpoint does not require authentication, enabling any remote user to exploit the vulnerability.
- The code reads files with system privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read any text file on the server, including sensitive configuration files or credentials. This could lead to further attacks or unauthorized access to other resources.
- **Data Breach:** Sensitive data can be extracted from the system, potentially leading to a data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is accessed via network requests over HTTPS on TCP port 3037.
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/FSF/CMD` endpoint, containing an XML message with a `RECORD` having `NAME` set to `FSFUI` and `UICMD` set to `126`, and a `FILE` tag containing a file path (either absolute or relative path).
- **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the target server.
- **Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- **XML Crafting:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific XML message to send to the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted XML message to the `/FSF/CMD` endpoint.
- The file is read with the privileges of the SYSTEM account.
