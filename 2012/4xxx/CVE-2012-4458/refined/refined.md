  "CVE-2012-4458": {
    "description": "It was found that the AMQP type decoder in qpidd allowed arbitrary data types in certain messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a message containing an excessively large amount of data, causing qpidd to allocate a large amount of memory. qpidd would then be killed by the Out of Memory killer (denial of service).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The AMQP type decoder in qpidd allowed arbitrary data types, specifically large arrays of zero-width types in certain messages.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Uncontrolled memory allocation"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a message with an excessively large amount of data, leading to excessive memory allocation that triggers the Out of Memory (OOM) killer and terminates the qpidd process.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based",
        "Sending malicious AMQP messages"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to establish an AMQP connection with the broker, sending a crafted message with an excessively large array of zero-width type elements in the client-properties map of a connection.start-ok message."
