# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

Subject: Multiple SQL injections in MySQL/MariaDB

Hi.

Recently, our developer Kristian Nielsen have discovered multiple SQL
injection like vulnerabilities in MySQL and MariaDB.
As of today, all versions of MySQL are affected.
Affected MariaDB versions are: 5.1.62 and below, 5.2.12 and below, 5.3.7 and
below, 5.5.25 and below. Latest MariaDB releases 5.3.8 and 5.5.27 have
this problem fixed.

The issue is numerous places in the code where SQL statements are
generated and written into the binary log. User-supplied identifiers
(table names, field names, etc.) are not always properly quoted (for
example, the proper quoted form of SPECI`AL is `SPECI``AL`), so
authorised users that have privileges to modify a table (any
non-temporary table) can inject arbitrary SQL into the binary log.

Such injected SQL will be executed by the slave or when a DBA does a
mysqlbinlog|mysql style point-in-time recovery.

During the normal MySQL replication (master-slave, not
mysqlbinlog|mysql), the options to exploit these vulnerabilities are
somewhat limited by the fact, that the slave does not execute many
statements, when it expects the one. So, one can not inject a new SQL
statement. But one can extend the WHERE condition, or modify tables that
he usually would have no access to.

Just to be clear: to exploit this one needs a valid account on the
server and privileges to modify data.

Regards,
Sergei Golubchik
MariaDB Security Coordinator

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=852144#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-27 17:30:40 UTC  ``` Multiple SQL injection flaws were found in the way the binlog functionality (routines producing events describing database changes such as table creation operations or changes to table data) of MySQL, a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server, performed sanitization of table names and other fields prior creating particular log entry. Authorised database users (with privilege to modify tables) could use this flaw to inject arbitrary SQL query into subsequently generated binlog entries.

[![](data:image/svg+xml... "slamdata")](http://slamdata.com/)

## [SlamData](http://slamdata.com/)

SlamData is the leading provider of post relational analytics. Modern applications including IoT, social media and SaaS often create and store data in non-relational formats, including JSON, XML, or CSV. These formats do not fit easily into a relational data structure required for querying with existing analytics and BI tools. This forces organizations to build complex ETL processes or spend weeks attempting to wrangle the data. SlamData is the only solution that works natively against any data regardless of degree of structure. The open source solution allows users to explore, query and visualize complex data without any ETL or mapping, ever. User can easily embed reports and build interactive dashboards that reflect live data stored in MongoDB. SlamData powers analytics and reporting solutions for Fortune 500 companies, startups and government agencies. It’s the go-to tool for software developers, data scientists, business intelligence professionals, product managers and more.

# CVE-2012-4414 strikes back in MySQL 5.5.29 (and what we’re doing in Percona Server 5.5.29)

January 13, 2013

[Stewart Smith](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/stewart)

In preparing Percona Server 5.5.29 (not yet released, but soon), I filed [MySQL bug 68045](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=68045) (is marked private as it’s a security bug). This bug is in relation to the Oracle fix for [CVE-2012-4414](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4414) and a problem I found with it. The MariaDB fix (which we incorporated into [Percona Server 5.5.28-29.3](https://www.percona.com/blog/2013/01/08/announcing-percona-server-5-5-28-29-3/)) is not affected.

When the MariaDB team fixed [CVE-2012-4414](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4414) they created a test case named [rpl\_mdev382.test](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~percona-core/percona-server/5.5/view/head%3A/Percona-Server/mysql-test/suite/rpl/t/rpl_mdev382.test) which can be found in MariaDB and Percona Server sources. It is named after the designation in their bug database, [MDEV-382](https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-382).  Having a public test case for such a bug is very important, it means that anyone can verify if their MySQL server is vulnerable, after all, many people run their own patches. It allows Linux distributions to check that what they ship is okay or not which typically includes a few patches on top of the base distribution.

Sadly, Oracle did not run the MariaDB test against their own fix for this bug. While there are many reasons why Oracle does not take patches (that no user cares about), having Oracle re-implement bug fixes is really just a waste of Oracle time and money rather than anybody else’s. However, in this instance, even though they didn’t publish a test case (presumably they have one internally), we still have a test case courtesy of the MariaDB developers.

I used the MariaDB test case against my branch that updated Percona Server to be based on MySQL 5.5.29 and I noticed it failed. I then tried the test case on stock MySQL 5.5.29 (the Oracle provided binaries); it also failed.

Basically, the following snippet from rpl\_mdev382:

> eval LOAD DATA INFILE '$MYSQLTEST\_VARDIR/tmp/f''le.txt' INTO TABLE `t``1`
> FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ESCAPED BY '\\\\' ENCLOSED BY ''''
> LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n'
> (`a``1`, @`b```) SET `b``2` = @`b```, `c``3` = concat('|', "b""a'z", "!");
>
> | 1234 | eval LOAD DATA INFILE '$MYSQLTEST\_VARDIR/tmp/f''le.txt' INTO TABLE `t``1`  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ESCAPED BY '\\\\' ENCLOSED BY ''''  LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n'  (`a``1`, @`b```) SET `b``2` = @`b```, `c``3` = concat('|', "b""a'z", "!"); |
> | --- | --- |

becomes this error in the slave:

> `Last_Error Error 'You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ') SET b2= @b, c3= concat('|', "b""a'z", "!")' at line 1' on query. Default database: 'db1; SELECT 'oops!''. Query: 'LOAD DATA INFILE '../../tmp/SQL_LOAD-2-1-1.data' INTO TABLE t1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\'' ESCAPED BY '\\' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' (a1, @b) SET b2= @b, c3`= concat('|', "b""a'z", "!")'`

Which (check it if you like), means that the Oracle fix is incorrect and ruins quoting in this situation, which then breaks statement based replication. Users of MariaDB and Percona Server are not affected, only MySQL 5.5.29 users are.

For Percona Server 5.5.29, we are planning to just keep the MariaDB based fix. Once Oracle fixes this bug, we may re-evaluate that (in order to keep a smaller delta from MySQL) but for our next release, we would prefer not to expose our users to a regression.

In fact, creating the test case for the bug was probably more than 50% of the total work to fix the issue.

So it is nice to get confirmation how important it is to spend the effort to do proper test cases, and how the time spend is worthwhile.

Just wanted to add here that Oracle MySQL 5.5.31 passes the test accept for the case “\*\*\* Test truncation of long SET expression in LOAD DATA \*\*\*”. I do not think “\*\*\* Test truncation of long SET expression in LOAD DATA \*\*\*” is a vulnerability and is not related to CVE-2012-4414. So I guess its safe to say that 5.5.31 fixes the vulnerability CVE-2012-4414.

Incorrect truncation is certainly a vulnerability. Why would you say otherwise?

For example, if a string litteral is truncated in the middle. Then a later string litteral will
 be parsed as SQL expression.

Hi Kristian,

You are actually right, thank you for correcting me. I am able to cause sql injection due to truncation, I have opened a new bug: <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=69124> and also on launchpad because Oracle would soon mark that one as private: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/mysql-server/+bug/1175519](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mysql-server/%2Bbug/1175519)

Ovais –

It seems Oracle attempt to fix it again in 5.5.33. Would you be willing to test for rpl\_mdev382 and #69124?

 0  ![Ovais Tariq](data:image/svg+xml...) [Ovais Tariq](https://www.percona.com/)    11 years ago

Laurynas,

It seems this time its completely fixed in 5.5.33

# Percona Careers

Live and work from anywhere!

[Find your next role](#get-started)

### Remote by Design

Since its founding in 2006, Percona has always been a remote company. The reason? It’s a tech company that knows how to use technology effectively and doesn’t want to have geography limit its talent pool, said CEO Ann Schlemmer.
![](data:image/svg+xml...)

We have a high degree of trust with our staff. Leaders aren’t checking to see what time workers log in each day or moni toring if their light on Slack is green. You can’t have that sort of behavior and have an effective remote company. I have pride in how we live our values. That’s one of our values: We don’t care where you’re located... If someone is a digital nomad and that’s their lifestyle and that makes them happiest, I think that brings productivity. The goal is for employees to get their work done and then just enjoy life.”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Ann Schlemmer**
CEO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

Every day at Percona, I am fortunate to collaborate with exceptional colleagues across every department, creating an environment where expertise is all around us. Our collective excellence is not only a daily inspiration, but it also raises the performance bar for everyone. I am truly grateful to be a part of a culture where our commitment to core values is palpable, driving our unwavering dedication to delivering for our customers, community, and colleagues. We rarely have a boring day here at Percona!”
![](data:image/svg+xml...)
**Bennie Grant**
COO Percona

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

What keeps me excited every day is Percona's unique culture and remote-only approach. It provides me with daily opportunities to collaborate with colleagues from all over the world, which enriches my work experience. We push boundaries, offer flexibility, and create a dynamic environment that fosters innovation and finding a better way.

# CVE-2012-4414 strikes back in MySQL 5.5.29 (and what we’re doing in Percona Server 5.5.29)

January 13, 2013

[Stewart Smith](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/stewart)

In preparing Percona Server 5.5.29 (not yet released, but soon), I filed [MySQL bug 68045](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=68045) (is marked private as it’s a security bug). This bug is in relation to the Oracle fix for [CVE-2012-4414](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4414) and a problem I found with it. The MariaDB fix (which we incorporated into [Percona Server 5.5.28-29.3](https://www.percona.com/blog/2013/01/08/announcing-percona-server-5-5-28-29-3/)) is not affected.

When the MariaDB team fixed [CVE-2012-4414](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4414) they created a test case named [rpl\_mdev382.test](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~percona-core/percona-server/5.5/view/head%3A/Percona-Server/mysql-test/suite/rpl/t/rpl_mdev382.test) which can be found in MariaDB and Percona Server sources. It is named after the designation in their bug database, [MDEV-382](https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-382).  Having a public test case for such a bug is very important, it means that anyone can verify if their MySQL server is vulnerable, after all, many people run their own patches. It allows Linux distributions to check that what they ship is okay or not which typically includes a few patches on top of the base distribution.

Sadly, Oracle did not run the MariaDB test against their own fix for this bug. While there are many reasons why Oracle does not take patches (that no user cares about), having Oracle re-implement bug fixes is really just a waste of Oracle time and money rather than anybody else’s. However, in this instance, even though they didn’t publish a test case (presumably they have one internally), we still have a test case courtesy of the MariaDB developers.

I used the MariaDB test case against my branch that updated Percona Server to be based on MySQL 5.5.29 and I noticed it failed. I then tried the test case on stock MySQL 5.5.29 (the Oracle provided binaries); it also failed.

Basically, the following snippet from rpl\_mdev382:

> eval LOAD DATA INFILE '$MYSQLTEST\_VARDIR/tmp/f''le.txt' INTO TABLE `t``1`
> FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ESCAPED BY '\\\\' ENCLOSED BY ''''
> LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n'
> (`a``1`, @`b```) SET `b``2` = @`b```, `c``3` = concat('|', "b""a'z", "!");
>
> | 1234 | eval LOAD DATA INFILE '$MYSQLTEST\_VARDIR/tmp/f''le.txt' INTO TABLE `t``1`  FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ESCAPED BY '\\\\' ENCLOSED BY ''''  LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n'  (`a``1`, @`b```) SET `b``2` = @`b```, `c``3` = concat('|', "b""a'z", "!"); |
> | --- | --- |

becomes this error in the slave:

> `Last_Error Error 'You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ') SET b2= @b, c3= concat('|', "b""a'z", "!")' at line 1' on query. Default database: 'db1; SELECT 'oops!''. Query: 'LOAD DATA INFILE '../../tmp/SQL_LOAD-2-1-1.data' INTO TABLE t1 FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '\'' ESCAPED BY '\\' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' (a1, @b) SET b2= @b, c3`= concat('|', "b""a'z", "!")'`

Which (check it if you like), means that the Oracle fix is incorrect and ruins quoting in this situation, which then breaks statement based replication. Users of MariaDB and Percona Server are not affected, only MySQL 5.5.29 users are.

For Percona Server 5.5.29, we are planning to just keep the MariaDB based fix. Once Oracle fixes this bug, we may re-evaluate that (in order to keep a smaller delta from MySQL) but for our next release, we would prefer not to expose our users to a regression.

In fact, creating the test case for the bug was probably more than 50% of the total work to fix the issue.

So it is nice to get confirmation how important it is to spend the effort to do proper test cases, and how the time spend is worthwhile.

Just wanted to add here that Oracle MySQL 5.5.31 passes the test accept for the case “\*\*\* Test truncation of long SET expression in LOAD DATA \*\*\*”. I do not think “\*\*\* Test truncation of long SET expression in LOAD DATA \*\*\*” is a vulnerability and is not related to CVE-2012-4414. So I guess its safe to say that 5.5.31 fixes the vulnerability CVE-2012-4414.

Incorrect truncation is certainly a vulnerability. Why would you say otherwise?

For example, if a string litteral is truncated in the middle. Then a later string litteral will
 be parsed as SQL expression.

Hi Kristian,

You are actually right, thank you for correcting me. I am able to cause sql injection due to truncation, I have opened a new bug: <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=69124> and also on launchpad because Oracle would soon mark that one as private: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/mysql-server/+bug/1175519](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mysql-server/%2Bbug/1175519)

Ovais –

It seems Oracle attempt to fix it again in 5.5.33. Would you be willing to test for rpl\_mdev382 and #69124?

 0  ![Ovais Tariq](data:image/svg+xml...) [Ovais Tariq](https://www.percona.com/)    11 years ago

Laurynas,

It seems this time its completely fixed in 5.5.33

# Announcing Percona Server 5.5.28-29.3

January 8, 2013

[Hrvoje Matijakovic](https://www.percona.com/blog/author/hrvojem)

Percona is glad to announce the release of *Percona Server* 5.5.28-29.3 on January 8th, 2012 (Downloads are available [here](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.5/Percona-Server-5.5.28-29.3/) and from the [Percona Software Repositories](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/installation.html)).

Based on [MySQL 5.5.28](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-28.html), including all the bug fixes in it, *Percona Server* 5.5.28-29.3 is now the current stable release in the 5.5 series. All of *Percona*‘s software is open-source and free, all the details of the release can be found in the [5.5.28-29.3 milestone at Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bmilestone/5.5.28-29.3).

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed the upstream bug [#66550](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=66550) and the security vulnerability [CVE-2012-4414](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-4414). This was caused because user-supplied identifiers (table names, field names, etc.) are not always properly quoted, so authorized users that have privileges to modify a table (any non-temporary table) can inject arbitrary SQL into the binary log and that could cause multiple SQL injection like vulnerabilities. This bug fix comes originally from MariaDB (see [MDEV-382](https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-382)). Bug fixed [#1049871](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1049871) (*Vlad Lesin*).
* Fixed the upstream bug [#67685](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=67685) and the security vulnerability [CVE-2012-5611](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5611). This vulnerability allowed remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a long argument to the `GRANT FILE` command. This bug fix comes originally from MariaDB (see [MDEV-3884](https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-3884)). Bug fixed [#1083377](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1083377) (*Vlad Lesin*).
* `Rows_read` was calculated in a way which lead to a negative value being printed in the slow query log. Fixed by making `Rows_read` to be a synonym for `Rows_examined` in the slow query log. Bug fixed [#830286](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/830286) (*Alexey Kopytov*).
* Fixed the upstream bug [#66237](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=66237). Temporary files created by binary log cache were not purged after transaction commit. Fixed by truncating the temporary file, if used for a binary log transaction cache, when committing or rolling back a statement or a transaction. Bug fixed [#1070856](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1070856) (*Alexey Kopytov*).
* Values for `Rows_sent` and `Rows_read` would be identical in the [Slow Query Log](file:///home/hrvoje/src/percona-server/release-5.5.28-29.3/doc/build/html/diagnostics/slow_extended_55.html#slow-extended-55). This bug was introduced when `slow_extended.patch` was ported to *Percona Server* 5.5. Fixed by making `Rows_read` identical to `Rows_examined` instead. Bug fixed [#721176](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/721176) (*Alexey Kopytov*).
* Fixed unsigned math error in `fsp_reserve_free_extents` that in some specific cases would cause the function to believe that billions more extents have been reserved than have actually been reserved. Bug fixed [#1083700](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1083700) (*George Ormond Lorch III*).
* When `mysqldump` was used with `--innodb-optimize-keys`, it did not handle composite indexes correctly when verifying if the optimization is applicable with respect to `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns. Bug fixed [#1039536](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1039536) (*Alexey Kopytov*).
* Upstream bug [#67606](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=67606) would cause *Percona Server* to crash with segmentation fault when disk quota was reached. Bug fixed [#1079596](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1079596) (*George Ormond Lorch III*).
* In cases where indexes with `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns where correctly detected, `mysqldump` prevented all such keys from optimization, even though it is sufficient to skip just one (e.g. the first one). Bug fixed [#1081003](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1081003) (*Alexey Kopytov*).

Other bug fixes: bug fixed [#1071986](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1071986) (*Alexey Kopytov*), bug fixed [#901060](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/901060) (*Laurynas Biveinis*), bug fixed [#1090596](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1090596) (*Stewart Smith*), bug fixed [#1087202](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1087202) (*Vladislav Vaintroub*, *Laurynas Biveinis*) and bug fixed [#1087218](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bbug/1087218) (*Vladislav Vaintroub*, *Laurynas Biveinis*).

Release notes for *Percona Server* 5.5.28-29.3 are available in our [online documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/5.5/release-notes/Percona-Server-5.5.28-29.3.html). Bugs can be reported on the [launchpad bug tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-server/%2Bfilebug).
