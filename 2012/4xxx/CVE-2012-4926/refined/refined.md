```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application's `approve.php` script allows modification of the `approved` status of members by directly using the `$_GET` parameters in a SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection vulnerability and lack of input validation.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can remotely disable an administrator account, preventing the administrator from accessing the site.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `approve.php` script with specific `u` (user ID) and `a` (action) parameters.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
