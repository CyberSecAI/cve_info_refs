Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The course reset functionality in Moodle was not consistently protected by the same permission check. While the link to initiate a course reset was correctly protected, the actual reset page was being checked for a different, less restrictive permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inconsistent permission checks: The vulnerability lies in the fact that the course reset functionality was protected by two different permissions which allows users with improper permission to reset a course.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized course reset: An attacker with course editing capabilities but without the permission to reset the course can exploit this vulnerability to reset a course. This leads to loss of data, disruption of the course environment, and potential unavailability of course materials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct access to the reset page: An attacker who has course editing capabilities, and can figure out the course reset page URL can exploit this flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have course editing capabilities within Moodle.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the reset page url, as the link to the reset page is correctly permissioned, but the page itself is not.
