Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `elinks` text-based web browser. Specifically, it's in how `elinks` handles client credentials during GSSAPI (Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface) negotiation.
*   `Elinks` was improperly delegating client credentials to the server during the GSS security mechanism negotiation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Credential Delegation:** `Elinks` was configured to delegate GSSAPI credentials by default, which is not always safe.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Impersonation:** A malicious server could exploit this flaw to obtain the `elinks` client's credentials.
*   **Denial of Service:** The rogue server could then impersonate the client against the legitimate (intended) server, potentially leading to a denial of service for the victim client by preventing the client from accessing the service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** A remote, malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control a server that the `elinks` client connects to, which initiates a GSSAPI negotiation.

**Technical Details:**

*   The fix involves modifying the `http_negotiate.c` file in `elinks` to disable the GSSAPI credential delegation flag by default by changing `GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG` to `0`. This prevents the client from automatically sending credentials to the server during GSSAPI negotiation.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Marko Myllynen of Red Hat.

**Affected Software:**

*   `Elinks` versions as shipped with:
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.
    *   Fedora releases 16 and 17
    * Debian squeeze, wheezy, and sid

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by disabling credential delegation in GSSAPI by default and by providing updated `elinks` packages.

**Additional Notes:**

* The Red Hat Security Response Team rated this update as having moderate security impact.
*  The issue was addressed in Red Hat via RHSA-2013:0250, which included backported patches.
* Debian also issued a security advisory (DSA-2592-1) and released updated packages of elinks.
* Patches were also provided to the upstream elinks project.

This vulnerability is well documented, with details provided in the Red Hat Bugzilla, the Red Hat Security Advisory, and the Debian Security Advisory. Patches were provided to affected distributions.
