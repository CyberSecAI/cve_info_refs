{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ppm2tiff` tool in libtiff does not properly check the return value of the `TIFFScanlineSize()` function. When `TIFFScanlineSize()` encounters an integer overflow, it returns zero. This zero value is then used in a memory allocation call without any validation, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based Buffer Overflow",
      "Missing Return Value Check"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted PPM image file that, when processed by `ppm2tiff`, would lead to a crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the `ppm2tiff` binary.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a malicious PPM image via the `ppm2tiff` tool."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PPM image and have it processed by a vulnerable version of the `ppm2tiff` tool."
