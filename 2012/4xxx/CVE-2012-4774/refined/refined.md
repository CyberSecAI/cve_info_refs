  "CVE-2012-4774": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Windows parses filenames. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Windows fails to properly handle a specially crafted file or subfolder name, allowing data to be copied into memory that has not been properly allocated.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of specially crafted file/folder names",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the current user. If the current user is an administrator, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Convincing a user to browse to a file system containing a file or subfolder with a specially crafted name.",
      "Hosting a file with a specially crafted filename on a network share, UNC share, or WebDAV location.",
      "Sending a specially crafted file or subfolder as an email attachment.",
        "Hosting a website that contains a file with a specially crafted name and convincing users to visit it, typically through links in emails or IM messages."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to host files with crafted names or send them as attachments and then trick the user into accessing them.",
      "additional_notes": "Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs."
