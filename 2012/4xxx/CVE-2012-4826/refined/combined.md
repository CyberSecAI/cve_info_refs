# Security Vulnerabilities, HIPER and Special Attention APARs fixed in DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows Version 9.7

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

This document contains a list of fixes for Security and HIPER APARs in DB2 Version 9.7

## Content

A set of security vulnerabilities was discovered in some DB2 database products. These vulnerabilities were analyzed by the DB2 development organization and a set of corresponding fixes was created to address the reported issues. IBM is not currently aware of any externally reported incidents where production DB2 installations have been compromised due to these issues.

The affected DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows products are:

* DB2 Enterprise Server Edition
* DB2 Workgroup Server (all Editions)
* DB2 Express Server (all Editions)
* DB2 Personal Edition
* DB2 Connect Server (all Editions)

DB2 Client component and DB2 products or components other than those listed above are not affected.

Due to the complexity of the fixes required to eliminate the reported service issues, it is not feasible to retrofit the same fixes into earlier DB2 Version 9.7 fix packs.
