Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the SQL/PSM (Persistent Stored Modules) debugging infrastructure of IBM DB2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when data is written beyond the allocated buffer space on the stack, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow.
- This could potentially lead to remote code execution, meaning the attacker could execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the SQL/PSM debugging infrastructure.
- It can be exploited by an authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of the DB2 database system.
- The attacker needs to interact with the SQL/PSM debugging infrastructure in a way that triggers the overflow.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of DB2, including 9.1, 9.5, 9.7, 9.8 and 10.1, across various platforms such as AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows.
- The vulnerability also affects IBM Data Studio and Db2 Connect.
- The vulnerability is fixed in DB2 Version 9.7 Fix Pack 7 (as per the provided text mentioning IC86781).
