Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `exc_to_s()` and `name_err_to_s()` methods within the Ruby interpreter. These methods incorrectly handle the `$SAFE` level, specifically level 4, which is intended for sandboxing untrusted code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Safe Level Bypass:** The `exc_to_s()` and `name_err_to_s()` methods allow untrusted code running in `$SAFE = 4` to bypass the intended security restrictions.
- **Tainting of Untainted Strings:** These methods allow a string that is initially not tainted to be destructively marked as tainted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Modification of Untainted Strings:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to modify previously untainted string objects. This allows for the manipulation of data that should have been protected within the sandbox.
- **Security Sandbox Evasion:**  The $SAFE level 4 security mechanism, which restricts certain operations to protect data outside the sandbox, can be bypassed, breaking the isolation of untrusted code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Untrusted Code Execution:**  The primary attack vector is through the execution of untrusted Ruby code within a sandbox where `$SAFE = 4`.
- **Exception and NameError Handling:** The vulnerability is triggered when an exception or name error is converted to a string using `Exception#to_s` or `NameError#to_s`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Execute Untrusted Code:** An attacker needs the ability to execute untrusted Ruby code within an environment configured with `$SAFE = 4`.
- **Access to Untainted Strings:** The attacker also requires access to untainted string objects that they wish to modify.

**Affected Versions:**
- Ruby 1.9.3-p0 and later versions, up to but not including 1.9.3-p286.
- Development branches of Ruby 2.0 prior to revision r37068.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is related to a previous issue (CVE-2011-1005), but the vulnerability was reintroduced in revision 29456 to Ruby's trunk.
- The fix involves changes to `error.c` in the Ruby source code.
- This vulnerability is distinct from a similar vulnerability affecting `name_err_mesg_to_str()`, which is tracked as CVE-2012-4466.

**Mitigation**
Upgrade to Ruby version 1.9.3-p286 or later.
