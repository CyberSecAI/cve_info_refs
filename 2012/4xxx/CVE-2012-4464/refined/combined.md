Subject: CVE Request: Ruby safe level bypasses

Hello - Upstream Ruby has fixed[1] exception methods that incorrectly
allowed safe level bypasses. These bypasses allowed untainted strings to
be modified by untrusted code in safe level 4.

Note that the changes to exc_to_s() and name_err_to_s(), in error.c, are
similar to the fix for CVE-2011-1005, but the Ruby advisory[2] made it
clear that Ruby 1.9.x was not affected by CVE-2011-1005. It turns out
that the vulnerability was later reintroduced to Ruby's trunk in
revision 29456. Ruby 1.9.3-p0 and later is affected.

While Shugo Maeda was fixing the issue above, he noticed that
name_err_mesg_to_str() had a similar flaw. Ruby 1.8.x, along with
1.9.3-p0 and later is affected.

I believe that these issues need two separate CVEs. Both issues are
fixed in the same upstream patch[1]. Could you please allocate ids?

Thanks,
Tyler

# $SAFE escaping vulnerability about Exception#to\_s / NameError#to\_s (CVE-2012-4464, CVE-2012-4466)

Posted by usa on 12 Oct 2012

Vulnerabilities found for Exception#to\_s, NameError#to\_s, and
name\_err\_mesg\_to\_s() which is Ruby interpreter-internal API. A
malicious user code can bypass $SAFE check by utilizing one of those
security holes.

## Details

Ruby's $SAFE mechanism enables untrusted user codes to run in $SAFE
>= 4 mode. This is a kind of sandboxing so some operations are
restricted in that mode to protect other data outside the sandbox.

The problem found was around this mechanism. Exception#to\_s,
NameError#to\_s, and name\_err\_mesg\_to\_s() interpreter-internal API
was not correctly handling the $SAFE bits so a String object which is
not tainted can destructively be marked as tainted using them. By using
this an untrusted code in a sandbox can modify a formerly-untainted
string destructively.

Ruby 1.8 once had a [similar security issue](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2011/02/18/exception-methods-can-bypass-safe/). It fixed
Exception#to\_s and NameError#to\_s, but name\_err\_mesg\_to\_str()
issue survived previous security fix.

And this is why I should probably be more aggressive about asking for
commits to be broken out by software version if multiple versions are
affected =).

Ok let's continue to use CVE-2012-4464 for the exc_to_s() and
name_err_to_s() issues which affect 1.9.3-p0 and newer.

For name_err_mesg_to_str() which affects both 1.9.3-p0 and newer and
1.8.x please use CVE-2012-4466.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=862598#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-03 10:59:07 UTC  ``` Originally, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-1005](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1005) to the following vulnerability:  The safe-level feature in Ruby 1.8.6 through 1.8.6-420, 1.8.7 through 1.8.7-330, and 1.8.8dev allows context-dependent attackers to modify strings via the Exception#to_s method, as demonstrated by changing an intended pathname.  Later it was reported: [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=689075> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/10/02/4>  that upstream ruby 1.9.1 and ruby 1.9.3 versions are also vulnerable to this flaw.  Relevant upstream patch: [3] <http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=37068>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=862598#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-03 11:01:16 UTC  ``` Upstream public reproducer for the [CVE-2011-1005](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1005) issue (from: <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2011/02/18/exception-methods-can-bypass-safe/>)  $secret_path = "foo"  proc do     $SAFE = 4     Exception.new($secret_path).to_s     $secret_path.replace "/etc/passwd" end.call  open($secret_path) do   ... end  which can be used to test presence of the issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=862598#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-03 11:05:24 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the ruby package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 (refer to [bug #678920](show_bug.cgi?id=678920 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-1005 Ruby: Untrusted codes able to modify arbitrary strings") for further information about this flaw in ruby 1.8.x and earlier versions).  --  This issue did NOT affect the version of the ruby package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16.  --  This issue affects the version of the ruby package, as shipped with Fedora 17. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=862598#c3)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-03 20:49:51 UTC  ``` Based on comments reported to oss-sec, there are actually two issues here:  1) [CVE-2011-1005](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1005) was never reported to affect ruby 1.9.x, but it was later introduced (or re-introduced) on trunk, via r29456.  So ruby 1.9.3-p0 and later is affected by the same flaw that was assigned [CVE-2011-1005](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1005) in 1.8.x (it's been assigned the name [CVE-2012-4464](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4464))  2) The name_err_mesg_to_str() function has a similar flaw, and it affects both 1.8.x and 1.9.3-p0 and later.  This was assigned the name [CVE-2012-4466](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4466).  CVE assignments and explanations:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q4/10> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q4/13>  We'll keep this bug for [CVE-2012-4464](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4464), and [bug #862906](show_bug.cgi?id=862906 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2012-4466 ruby: safe level bypass via name_err_mesg_to_str()") for [CVE-2012-4466](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4466).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=862598#c4)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-03 20:53:14 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of ruby as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did not provide version 1.9.x, which is the vulnerable version of ruby.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=862598#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-10-04 08:57:01 UTC  ``` Created ruby tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 862907](show_bug.cgi?id=862907 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-4464 CVE-2012-4466 ruby: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=862598#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-28 19:08:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEL 6 Version of OpenShift Enterprise  Via RHSA-2013:0582 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0582.html>   ``` |  |
