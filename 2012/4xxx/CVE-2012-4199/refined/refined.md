Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4199:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Bugzilla's `field-events.js.tmpl` template handles custom field visibility. When a custom field's visibility is controlled by a product or component that a user is not authorized to see, the names of those products or components are still included in the generated JavaScript code. This occurs because the template directly embeds the names in the JavaScript using `showFieldWhen()` function call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of confidential product and component names to unauthorized users. Even though the UI might not display these names, they are present in the HTML source code of the page.
*   **Lack of proper access control:** The system fails to prevent the exposure of product/component names in Javascript code based on user access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Unauthorized users can gain insight into the existence of private products and components within the Bugzilla system. This can reveal sensitive information about the structure and organization of projects managed within Bugzilla.
*   While not direct, exposure of product/component names can potentially aid attackers in reconnaissance activities to identify targets for future attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited by simply accessing a bug page in Bugzilla where custom fields are configured with visibility rules linked to restricted products or components.
*   The attacker does not need to perform complex actions, but just requires viewing the HTML source of the bug page.
*   The attacker exploits the fact that the names are directly exposed in Javascript code generated by the `field-events.js.tmpl` template.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a Bugzilla account (or no account, see below) and access to a bug page where custom fields have visibility restrictions based on products and components.
*   The attacker must be in a position to view the HTML source code of the bug page.
*   The attacker does not need to have any special privilege on the bugzilla system. According to the description, even logged out users can be affected, revealing classifications for the product.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Bugzilla versions 3.3.4 to 3.6.11, 3.7.1 to 4.0.8, 4.1.1 to 4.2.3, and 4.3.1 to 4.3.3.
*   The fix involves modifying `template/en/default/bug/edit.html.tmpl` and `template/en/default/bug/field-events.js.tmpl` to avoid direct exposure of product and component names.
*   The fix also includes improvements for performance by passing the product object rather than just its name, reducing database lookups.
*   The fix hides classifications from logged out users.
*   The bug report also mentions that the vulnerability is fixed by [bug 695514](/show_bug.cgi?id=695514), but only partially, this is the reason this separate bug was created.
*   Patches were created for trunk (latest development), and also backported to 4.4, 4.2, 4.0 and 3.6 branches.
*   The patches were reviewed and approved by developers.
