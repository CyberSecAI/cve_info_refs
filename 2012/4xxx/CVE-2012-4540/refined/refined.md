Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4540:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** An off-by-one error exists in the `IcedTeaScriptableJavaObject::invoke` function within IcedTea-Web. This error occurs when handling exceptions during method invocation of Java applets.
*   **Weakness:** A heap-based buffer overflow due to incorrect memory allocation when creating error messages. The code does not allocate an extra byte for the null terminator `\0` when constructing a string to hold the error message.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Leak:** The overflow could potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure.
    *   **Denial of Service (Crash):** The overflow could cause the application to crash.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** In some scenarios, a specifically crafted payload could be used to execute arbitrary code.

**2. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Attack Vector:** Network. The vulnerability can be triggered via a crafted webpage.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A remote attacker with the ability to host a malicious web page and trick a user into visiting it.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `IcedTeaScriptablePluginObject.cc` within the IcedTea-Web plugin. Specifically, in the `invoke` function
*   The issue occurs when an applet method invocation throws an exception. IcedTea-web allocates memory to store the error message that it passes to the browser, however, it doesn't account for the null terminator.

**4. Affected Versions:**

*   IcedTea-Web versions prior to 1.1.7
*   IcedTea-Web 1.2.x before 1.2.2
*    IcedTea-Web 1.3.x before 1.3.1
*   IcedTea-Web 1.4.x before 1.4.1

**5. Mitigations & Fixes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in IcedTea-Web versions 1.1.7, 1.2.2, 1.3.1, and 1.4.1.
*   Patches were applied to the 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 branches, and then the fix was backported into the 1.4 branch.

**6. Additional Notes:**

*   The content reveals that CVE-2013-4349 was initially assigned for a similar issue in IcedTea-Web 1.4 due to the fix for CVE-2012-4540 not being included in the 1.4 branch. Eventually, CVE-2013-4349 was merged with CVE-2012-4540.
*   Different vendors assigned different severity scores based on their use of the software and other protections in place.

**In summary:** CVE-2012-4540 describes a heap-based buffer overflow in the IcedTea-Web plugin, which is exploitable through a malicious website. This could potentially lead to information disclosure, a crash, or even arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability was resolved in later versions of IcedTea-Web with a patch that correctly allocates memory for error messages.
