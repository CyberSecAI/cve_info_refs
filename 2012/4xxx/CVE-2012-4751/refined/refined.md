Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw present in how Open Technology Real Services (OTRS) handles HTML emails. Specifically, the issue lies in the parsing of HTML emails that contain JavaScript source attributes with whitespaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS issue (CWE-79) where user-supplied data within an HTML email is not properly sanitized when displayed within the OTRS application. This allows malicious JavaScript code to be injected and executed within the user's browser.
- **Improper Input Handling:** OTRS fails to sanitize or properly handle HTML emails, especially those containing JavaScript source attributes with whitespaces, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of a logged-in OTRS user.
- **Session Hijacking/Account Takeover:** With the ability to execute code, an attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking or other malicious activities.
- **Data Manipulation/Defacement:** The attacker may be able to modify or delete data displayed within the OTRS application, or even deface it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HTML Email:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTML email containing malicious JavaScript.
- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker sends the email to an OTRS user.
- **User Interaction (Implicit):** The user must view the malicious email within the OTRS application for the XSS to trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to OTRS users.
- **HTML Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious HTML email containing JavaScript code designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of OTRS:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how the OTRS application handles emails to successfully inject the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple OTRS versions: 2.4.x up to and including 2.4.14, 3.0.x up to and including 3.0.16, and 3.1.x up to and including 3.1.10.
- Patches were released for these versions: 2.4.15, 3.0.17 and 3.1.11.
- The provided CVSS metrics (Base: 5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) highlight the fact that the attack is performed over the network, with a low complexity and no authentication. The impact is a partial integrity compromise.
