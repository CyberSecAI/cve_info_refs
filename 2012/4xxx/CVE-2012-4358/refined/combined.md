Application: Sielco Sistemi Winlog
http://www.sielcosistemi.com/en/products/winlog\_scada\_hmi/
Versions: <= 2.07.16
UPDATE:
also the new version 2.07.17 is affected by almost all
these vulnerabilities since has been introduced a signed
comparison "if((signed int)value > 32) return;" for the
32bit number after the opcode (in my PoC usually I used
the value e6563600) so replace it with a negative value
(for example 6ccaf6ff but will not work with my
pre-existent PoC because it's aligned while my old tests
didn't care about alignment) and most of the bugs will
work again:
00411A03 |. 83F8 32 CMP EAX,32

From vendor's website:
"Simple, flexible and economical, Winlog Pro is a SCADA/HMI software
package for the supervision of industrial and civil plants."

=======
2) Bugs
=======
This software can act as a TCP/IP server by enabling the specific
"Run TCP/IP server" option available in the
"Configuration->Options->TCP/IP" section of the project we want to run
and Runtime.exe will listen on the TCP port 46824.
The part of the server running on this port uses a static buffer of
0x119 bytes to handle the incoming data so all the vulnerabilities
explained below can be exploited using these fixed addresses.
Then the exception handler used by the server allows to perform many
attempts without altering the normal work of the program.
-----------------------------------
A] DbiGetRecordCount code execution
-----------------------------------
DbfIntf.DbiGetRecordCount:
0038354B 8B10 MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]
0038354D FF92 F4000000 CALL DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+F4]
-----------------------------------------
B] @Db@TDataSet@Close$qqrv code execution
-----------------------------------------
Vcldb40.@Db@TDataSet@Close$qqrv:
46012BEE 8B08 MOV ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]
46012BF0 FF91 20010000 CALL DWORD PTR DS:[ECX+120]
----------------------------------
C] DbiSetToRecordNo code execution
----------------------------------
DbfIntf.DbiSetToRecordNo:
00382BEB 8B10 MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]
00382BED FF92 F4000000 CALL DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+F4]
---------------------------------------
D] \_TCPIPS\_BinOpenFileFP stack overflow
---------------------------------------
004134F6 /. 55 PUSH EBP
004134F7 |. 8BEC MOV EBP,ESP
004134F9 |. 81C4 FCFEFFFF ADD ESP,-104
...
00413525 |> FF75 08 PUSH DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8] ; /Arg4
00413528 |. 8B15 E8085B00 MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[5B08E8] ; |
0041352E |. 8D8D FCFEFFFF LEA ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-104] ; |
00413534 |. 81C2 E0020000 ADD EDX,2E0 ; |
0041353A |. 52 PUSH EDX ; |Arg3
0041353B |. 68 FC245600 PUSH Runtime.005624FC ; |Arg2 = 005624FC ASCII "%s\%s"
00413540 |. 51 PUSH ECX ; |Arg1
00413541 |. E8 B6BD1300 CALL Runtime.0054F2FC ; \RunTime.0054F2FC sprintf()
----------------------
E] Directory traversal
----------------------
Through opcode 0x78 is possible to open any file on the disk where the
server is running and with 0x96/0x97/0x98 is possible to read its
content.
---------
F] write4
---------
The opcodes used for the file operations specify a 32bit number that is
the element of the array returned by the server while opening the file
and so it can be used to load a file pointer outside the array
(stream lock table PUSH DWORD PTR DS:[EBX\*4+5B0024]) and maybe reaching
EnterCriticalSection with an arbitrary value:
EnterCriticalSection:
7C81A1C1 F0:0FB301 LOCK BTR DWORD PTR DS:[ECX],EAX ; LOCK prefix
Anyway exploiting a similar bug is very theoretical because it's hard
to bypass all the obstacles for using the own 32bit value with
EnterCriticalSection.
---------
G] write1
---------
The lack of checks on the return value of the realloc function used by
the software allows to put a 0x00 byte outside the existent buffer if
the specified size to reallocate is negative or unallocable:
Vcl40.@System@@LStrSetLength$qqrv:
40004F42 E8 E1DCFFFF CALL Vcl40.@System@@ReallocMem$qqrv
40004F47 58 POP EAX
40004F48 83C0 08 ADD EAX,8
40004F4B 8903 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EBX],EAX
40004F4D 8970 FC MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX-4],ESI
40004F50 C60430 00 MOV BYTE PTR DS:[EAX+ESI],0

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
