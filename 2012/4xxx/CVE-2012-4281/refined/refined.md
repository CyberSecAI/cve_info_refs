Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Travelon Express CMS v6.2.2:

**1. Multiple Remote SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP GET parameters. Specifically, the `hid`, `cid`, `id`, and `fid` parameters in various PHP files are vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL injection vulnerability, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete database compromise, including data breaches and potential modification of the application's data.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely via HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable files.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Remote attacker, no user interaction is required for most of the SQLi vulnerabilities (except the ones in admin panel which require privileged account).

**Vulnerable Modules:**
    *   `holiday.php?hid`
    *   `pages.php?id`
    *   `holiday_book.php?hid`
    *   `admin/airline-edit.php?fid`
    *   `admin/customer-edit.php?cid`

**2. Multiple Persistent Input Validation Vulnerabilities**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization on user supplied data, allowing injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Persistent XSS vulnerability, allowing attackers to inject malicious script code that executes in the context of other users when they view the affected content.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, persistent context manipulation. An attacker could potentially gain control of administrative accounts or inject malicious content that affects other users.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by injecting malicious script code into input fields, specifically the "holiday name" field.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a privileged user account and low user interaction.

**Vulnerable Modules:**
    *   `holiday_add.php` - holiday name field
    *   `holiday_view.php` - holiday name field

**3. Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability**

*  **Root Cause:** The application allows privileged users to upload arbitrary files (including executable files) without proper validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Arbitrary file upload vulnerability. Specifically, the application doesn't properly restrict the file extensions that can be uploaded. This allows an attacker to upload and execute malicious files such as webshells.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The vulnerabilities can be exploited by uploading malicious files through the file upload functionalities. The attacker can bypass some restrictions using null byte injection (`%00`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Privileged user account (admin rights) required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Vulnerable Modules:**
    *   `airline-edit.php?fid`
    *   `hotel-image-add.php`
    *   `hotel-add.php`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `exploit-db.com` entry references three CVEs: CVE-2012-4281, CVE-2012-2939, and CVE-2012-2938. However, the main vulnerability details provided are for CVE-2012-4281.
*   The `secunia.com` content is generic information about their vulnerability research and doesn't provide specific details about this CVE.
*   The identified vulnerabilities are considered critical (SQL injection), medium (persistent XSS), and medium(-) (file upload) in severity.
*   The provided PoCs include examples of how to exploit each of the three vulnerabilities.
* The software version affected is Travelon Express CMS v6.2.2.
