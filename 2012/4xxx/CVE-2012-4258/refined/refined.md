Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-4258:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the `link_idd` and `userid` parameters. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands into the database queries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Database compromise
    *   Application compromise
    *   Exposure of sensitive data
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote, through HTTP requests to vulnerable pages with manipulated parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No special user interaction required for successful SQL injection. A remote attacker can inject SQL commands via the `link_idd` and `userid` parameters.

**Vulnerability 2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `bedrooms1` and `price2` parameters. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts that will be executed by the victim's browser.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to:
    *   Hijacking of user sessions (customer, moderator, admin)
    *   Account theft
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Client-side content manipulation
*   **Attack Vectors:** Remote, through crafted URLs with malicious scripts in the `bedrooms1` and `price2` parameters.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker needs medium to high user interaction. The user needs to click the malicious link.

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**
*   Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the `listings.php` and `agentprofile.php` scripts, parameters `link_idd` and `userid` respectively.
*   Multiple non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in `search.php`, parameters `bedrooms1` and `price2`
