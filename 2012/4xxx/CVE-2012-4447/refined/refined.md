{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2012-4447",
    "description": "LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain malformed images using the PixarLog compression format. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow in libtiff's parsing of files using PixarLog compression.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Application crash (denial of service) or arbitrary code execution with user privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted TIFF image"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to trick a user or automated system into opening a malicious TIFF image.",
     "additional_information": "The issue was partially fixed in libtiff 4.0.2 and completely fixed in libtiff 4.0.3. Overwrite outside of the heap is only a few bytes, but could lead to arbitrary code execution. "
