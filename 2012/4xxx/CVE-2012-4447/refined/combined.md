How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1631-1: LibTIFF vulnerabilities

15 November 2012

LibTIFF could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [tiff](/security/cves?package=tiff) - Tag Image File Format (TIFF) library

## Details

It was discovered that LibTIFF incorrectly handled certain malformed images

using the PixarLog compression format. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker

could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2012-4447](/security/CVE-2012-4447))

Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala discovered that the ppm2tiff tool incorrectly

handled certain malformed PPM images. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a specially crafted PPM image, a remote attacker could

crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2012-4564](/security/CVE-2012-4564))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

  -
  [3.9.2-2ubuntu0.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tiff/3.9.2-2ubuntu0.11)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

I had a look at the libtiff-4.0.3 commit logs and found one issue which
seems to bring a possibility of heap-based buffer overflow when using a
tiff file with PixarLog compression format.

More details at:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=860198>

Though memory overwrite outside the heap-buffer is only a few bytes, one
cannot really overwrite possible arbitrary code execution.

Can a CVE id be please assigned to the above flaw?

Found two other commits which seemed interesting, but i dont think
they could cause arbitrary code execution and i dont want to call
them security flaws.

1. OOB read crash tif_packbits.c
2. Memory not properly initialised in tif_fax3.c. Again this one was
partly fixed in 4.0.2 and completely fixed in 4.0.3

If anyone else wants to investigate these in more details, please be my
guest :)

Thanks!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4447

It was discovered that a buffer overflow in libtiff's parsing of files
using PixarLog compression could lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.9.6-9 of the tiff3
source package and in version 4.0.2-4 of the tiff source package.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-09-25 08:58:59 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libtiff, library for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, processed certain TIFF images using PixarLog Compression format. An attacker could create a specially-crafted TIFF image that, when opened, could cause an application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-09-25 09:01:45 UTC  ``` This issue was partly fixed in the libtiff-4.0.2 release via the following commit:  revision 1.37 date: 2012-05-24 23:21:45 +0000;  author: fwarmerdam;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2;  commitid: 5xHvb7ZoNW8P226w; Allocate working buffer one word larger since we "forward accumulate" and overwrite the end by one word in at least some cases.   and later seems to be completely resolved in libtiff-4.0.3 via the following commit:  revision 1.38 date: 2012-06-21 01:01:53 +0000;  author: fwarmerdam;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2;  commitid: i91tq45sntOmJv9w; make tbuf large enough for one stride past the end   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-09-25 09:05:09 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of libtiff as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  This issue affects the version of libtiff as shipped with Fedora 16 and Fedora 17.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c4)  Huzaifa S.

## Synopsis

Moderate: libtiff security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1590)

## Topic

Updated libtiff packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
Image File Format (TIFF) files.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libtiff processed
certain TIFF images using the Pixar Log Format encoding. An attacker could
create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, could cause an
application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-4447)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libtiff handled
DOTRANGE tags. An attacker could use this flaw to create a
specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application
linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-5581)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the tiff2pdf tool. An
attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that
would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-3401)

A missing return value check flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow,
was found in the ppm2tiff tool. An attacker could use this flaw to create a
specially-crafted PPM (Portable Pixel Map) file that would cause ppm2tiff
to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-4564)

The CVE-2012-5581, CVE-2012-3401, and CVE-2012-4564 issues were discovered
by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

All libtiff users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues. All running applications linked
against libtiff must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=871700#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-31 06:04:34 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way ppm2tiff, a tool to create a TIFF file from PPM, PGM and PBM image files, did not check the return value of TIFFScanlineSize() function. When TIFFScanlineSize encountered an integer-overflow and returned zero, this value was not checked. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PPM image format file, that when processed by ppm2tiff would lead to ppm2tiff executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the ppm2tiff binary.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=871700#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-31 06:24:55 UTC  ``` Analysis (I am using libtiff-4.0.3 as the base for the line numbers): ====================================================================  In ppm2tiff.c:241 the following code is used:  buf = (unsigned char *)_TIFFmalloc(TIFFScanlineSize(out));  However TIFFScanlineSize() detects an integer overflow using the following code segment:          if ((uint64)n!=m)         {                 TIFFErrorExt(tif->tif_clientdata,module,"Integer arithmetic overflow");                 n=0;         }         return(n); }  Due to overflow the return value from TIFFScanlineSize is zero. However ppm2tiff.c does not check this return value and uses zero to malloc memory via _TIFFmalloc.  _TIFFmalloc is just a wrapper around glibc malloc. As per glibc:         Even a request for zero bytes (i.e., malloc(0)) returns a        pointer to something of the minimum allocatable size.  So this causes some memory to be allocated to buf. Later data is written into buf via:                  if (TIFFWriteScanline(out, buf, row, 0) < 0)  This causes a heap-based buffer overflow.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=871700#c3)  Huzaifa S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-17 06:13:21 UTC  ``` A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way libtiff handled DOTRANGE tags. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file  that, when opened, would cause an application linked against libtiff to crash  or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.   This issue is fixed in libtiff-4.0.2   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c6)  Tom Lane    2012-10-30 16:23:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c5)) > Yeah.  I see that libtiff 4.0.x has completely rewritten the special cases > for DOTRANGE, but it's not clear whether that dodges this problem or not --  Turns out that indeed 4.0.3 does not crash.  It looks like these upstream commits were specifically intended to repair this type of problem:  2012-06-06 00:56:01  fwarmerdam  	* ChangeLog, libtiff/tif_dir.c: avoid special handling of 	PAGENUMBER, HALFTONEHINTS, YCBCRSUBSAMPLING and DOTRANGE in 	non-image directories  2012-06-06 02:06:20  fwarmerdam  	* ChangeLog, libtiff/tif_print.c: improve handling of PAGENUMBER, 	HALFTONEHINTS, YCBCRSUBSAMPLING and DOTRANGE  2012-06-08 01:15:21  fwarmerdam  	* ChangeLog, libtiff/tif_print.c: avoid pretty printing values 	without proper rawdata  I'm not sure about the backwards compatibility implications if we apply these patches --- it seems at least theoretically possible that some apps out there are expecting the original behavior of GetField/SetField.  On the other hand, it's unclear that there is any way to fix this crash without a behavioral change.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c11)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-11-08 05:19:28 UTC  ``` I backported the following upstream change and that seems to fix the crash.  2012-06-06 00:56:01  fwarmerdam  	* ChangeLog, libtiff/tif_dir.c: avoid special handling of 	PAGENUMBER, HALFTONEHINTS, YCBCRSUBSAMPLING and DOTRANGE in 	non-image directories   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c12)  Huzaifa S.

However, the only apparent alternative is to leave the bug unfixed, which is even less attractive.  The saving grace is that the case where an application might have a compatibility problem would be where it had special-case code to handle DotRange or one of the other "weird" TIFF tags whose behavior has been simplified by the patch. Such applications are probably very few and far between, since these tags are little-used.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-18 21:10:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1590 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1590.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=867235#c21)  Huzaifa S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-09-25 08:58:59 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libtiff, library for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, processed certain TIFF images using PixarLog Compression format. An attacker could create a specially-crafted TIFF image that, when opened, could cause an application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-09-25 09:01:45 UTC  ``` This issue was partly fixed in the libtiff-4.0.2 release via the following commit:  revision 1.37 date: 2012-05-24 23:21:45 +0000;  author: fwarmerdam;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2;  commitid: 5xHvb7ZoNW8P226w; Allocate working buffer one word larger since we "forward accumulate" and overwrite the end by one word in at least some cases.   and later seems to be completely resolved in libtiff-4.0.3 via the following commit:  revision 1.38 date: 2012-06-21 01:01:53 +0000;  author: fwarmerdam;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2;  commitid: i91tq45sntOmJv9w; make tbuf large enough for one stride past the end   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c3)  Huzaifa S.
