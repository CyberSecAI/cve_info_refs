| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.9 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 5.9 |

Affected Products  * This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS-XR Software, and Cisco IOS-XE Software.    Vulnerable ProductsA Cisco IOS router is potentially vulnerable when it is running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software, BGP routing is enabled on the router, and the router has at least one established BGP neighbor session. For more information on affected versions, see the "Software Versions and Fixes" section below.      A device running Cisco IOS XR has a vulnerable configuration if **BOTH** of the following conditions are true:      1. BGP mVPN routing is enabled and a neighbor is configured. The following example shows configuration commands that will be present: *router bgp* *address-family  mvpn*   *neighbor* 2. A neighbor session is established.      **Note:** For Cisco IOS XR, the only vulnerable configuration is *address-family  mvpn* as noted above. BGP mVPN with MDT is NOT affected.      A device running Cisco IOS has an affected configuration if **BOTH** of the following conditions are true:      1. BGP routing is enabled and a neighbor is configured. The following example shows configuration commands that will be   present: *router bgp*     *neighbor* 2. A BGP neighbor session is established.         You can determine if a BGP session is established using the **show ip bgp summary** command in Cisco IOS Software. In Cisco IOS XR software, you can determine if a BGP session is established using the **show bgp  mvpn all summary** command. The following example shows the output from an IOS router with two neighbor sessions established:      ```   Router# show ip bgp summary       ```      ```   !--- output shortened      ```                  ```   Neighbor        V    AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down State/PfxRcd      ```         ```   10.100.1.1      4   200      26      22      199    0    0 00:14:23 23      ```         ```   10.200.1.1      4   300      21      51      199    0    0 00:13:40 0      ```          To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableA Cisco IOS router is not vulnerable if BGP is not running, or if BGP does not have at least one neighbor session established. No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability. Cisco NXOS Software is not affected.      The following example shows output from a router with BGP enabled, two neighbors configured, but with no sessions established with the remote BGP peers:      ```   Router# show ip bgp summary       ```      ```   !--- output shortened      ```                  ```   Neighbor        V    AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down State/PfxRcd      ```         ```   10.100.1.1      4   200      0       0        0    0    0 never    Idle      ```         ```   10.200.1.1      4   300      0       2        0    0    0 never    Idle      ```  Details  * Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability in the BGP routing protocol feature. This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS-XR Software, and Cisco IOS-XE Software. Cisco NXOS Software is not affected.      The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a malformed attribute from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable.      Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause all BGP peers to reset. Repeated exploitation may result in an inability to route packets to BGP neighbors during reconvergence times.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs [CSCtt35379](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/%7B%7Bvalue%7D%7D) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCty58300](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/%7B%7Bvalue%7D%7D) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4617. The corresponding Cisco IOS XR Software bug IDs are [CSCtz63248](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/%7B%7Bvalue%7D%7D) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCtz62914](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/%7B%7Bvalue%7D%7D) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
