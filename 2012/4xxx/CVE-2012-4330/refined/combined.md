Application: Samsung devices with support for remote controllers
http://www.samsung.com
Versions: current
Platforms: the vulnerable protocol is used on both TV and blue-ray
devices so both of them should be vulnerable (my tests
were performed only on a D6000 TV with the latest
firmware); the following are the products listed on the
iTunes section of the app but note that I have NOT
tested them:
- TV released in 2010 with Internet@TV feature
Models greater than or equal to LCD 650, LED 6500 and PDP 6500
- TV released in 2011 with AllShare feature
Models greater than or equal to LCD 550, LED 5500 and PDP 5500
- BD released in 2011 with Smart Hub feature
Models greater than or equal to BD-Player D5300
Models greater than or equal to BD-HTS D5000
BD-AVR D7000
BD-HDD Combo D6900/8200/8500/8900

1) Introduction
===============
All the current Samsung TV and BD systems can be controlled remotely
via iPad, Android and other software/devices supporting the protocol
used on TCP port 55000:
http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/samsung-remote/id359580639
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.remoteTV
The vulnerabilities require only the Ethernet/wi-fi network connected
to be exploited so anyone with access to that network can do it.
I have not tested if there are limitations on Internet or in big WANs.
The remote controller feature is enabled by default like all the other
services (over 40 TCP ports opened on the TV).
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
When the controller packet is received on the device it displays a
message on the screen for telling the user that a new "remote" device
has been found and he must select "allow" or "deny" to continue.
The message includes also the name and MAC address specified in the
received packet, they are just normal strings (there is even a field
containing the IP address for unknown reasons).
-------------------
A] Endless restarts
-------------------
The controller packet contains a string field used for the name of the
controller.
When the user selects one of the two choices (allow/deny) available
after having received an invalid name string (for example containing
line feed and other invalid chars) the device enters in the following
endless loop:
- for about 5 seconds everything seems to work correctly
- then the TV can be no longer controlled manually (both the TV remote
controller and the TV panel become slow and then completely
inactive), it just doesn't accept inputs
- after other 5 seconds the TV restarts automatically
- this situation will continue forever
During these continuous reboots it's not even possible to reset the
device (for example the "EXIT" button for 15 seconds can't work in
this state) or doing other operations allowed by the normal users
without affecting the warranty.
This is not a simple temporary Denial of Service, the TV is just
impossible to be used and reset so it's necessary the manual
intervention of the technical assistance that will reset it via the
service mode (luckily the 5 seconds of activity are enough to reach the
reset option).
The user can avoid the exploiting of the vulnerability by pushing the
EXIT button on the controller when the message with allow/deny is
displayed on the screen.
---------------------------
B] Possible buffer-overflow
---------------------------
By setting some fields like the MAC address to a long string it's
possible to crash the device, probably due to a buffer-overflow
vulnerability (just my guess).
No additional analysis is possible because I can't debug the device and
sincerely I'm not interested in killing my poor TV just for finding
other bugs and understanding them :)

No fix because I wanted to report the problems to Samsung but an e-mail
address doesn't exist for these types of bugs (support@samsung.com is
not available).
It would have been useful also for having more details about the
problems and knowing if all or only some devices are affected but no
way.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
