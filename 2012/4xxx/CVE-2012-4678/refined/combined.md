Subject: CVE Request (minor) -- Two Munin graphing framework flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   the following three problems has been recently reported against Munin:
   [1] Insecure temp file use in the qmailscan plug-in:

       <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812889>
       <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668778>

   [2] Possibility to inject escape sequences into Munin's log file:

       <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812885>
       <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668666>

   [3] Remote users can fill /tmp filesystem:
       Red Hat would not consider this to be a security flaw =>
       no RH BTS entry.

       Original report:
       <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668667>

For the first two -- though both of them having minor security impact,
under suitable circumstances they could lead to trust boundary crossing =>
under our opinion they should get a (CVE-2012-*) identifiers.

For the third issue -- we wouldn't consider it to be a security
flaw. Just as something, which on improperly configured machine
could allow to fill in /tmp filesystem (just another way how to
do it, when the particular service isn't properly configured).

Could you allocate CVE ids for the first two issues?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

I reread this one a few times, I'm not clear on what:

==========
printf 'GET
/cgi-bin/munin-cgi-graph/localdomain/localhost.localdomain/vmstat-day.png?foo
HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: localhost\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n' | nc
localhost 80

Provided that the filename actually exists, munin will render the image
==========

means exactly, does the file vmstat-day.png need to exist where? It
seems like if the image is of any size (say 20k or more) the
amplification (each get request = 20k of tmp space usage) and the
files have to be deleted manually it might qualify as a DoS.

helmut@...divi.de can you shed more light on this?

Subject: munin-cgi-graph: remote users can fill the /tmp filesystem
Date: Fri, 13 Apr 2012 23:51:23 +0200
```
Package: munin
Version: 2.0~rc4-1
Severity: important
Tags: security

printf 'GET /cgi-bin/munin-cgi-graph/localdomain/localhost.localdomain/vmstat-day.png?foo HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: localhost\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n' | nc localhost 80

Provided that the filename actually exists, munin will render the image
and store it as
/tmp/munin-cgi-graph/localdomain/localhost.localdomain/vmstat-day.png?foo.
By choosing a unique string instead of foo for each request an adversary
is able to create one png file per http request none of which are ever
deleted. He is thus able to exhaust the filesystem for /tmp. The issue
gets worse when /tmp is a tmpfs.

Again this issue seems to only affect the 2.x branch (sid).

The basic requirement is that a plugin called vmstat is configured for
the node localhost.localdomain. I just picked it as an example, cause it
is present on my system. In practise any plugin for any host will do.

The filling of the disk works by choosing a unique query string for each
request, because munin "caches" all theses images without ever deleting
them and includes the query string in the filename. So you are right,
that we get a base amplification of 20k/request.

In addition munin parses parts of the query string. You are allowed to
modify the size of the image. By choosing a path
"....png?size_x=20000&size_y=20000&uniquestuff" you can do the same
attack while simultaneously using a large image size. The raw image
would be 381M (assuming 8bits/pixel) in this case. A png version will
likely be smaller, say 4M? So now you have an amplification of
4M/request. Note that this query can get a node into swapping, because
rrdtool needs to create the whole image in main memory.

Hope this helps

Helmut

Is this the default configuration?

I am not that sure about the defaults, because I changed them. However
running a Munin without any plugins is pointless. It is like running a
mail server that does not transport any mail. You don't even have to
guess the name of a configured plugin, because those images are linked
from the html. Finding a configured plugin is really no issue on any
sane munin installation. Sane administrators may have to restricted
access to munin to themselves as to not expose the monitoring results to
the public though.

If anyone can comment on this (default/not), and if you install a
plugin does it expose it publicly or does the administrator have to
enable remote access?

The packaging of munin node determines whether it will install
symlinks for enabling plugins. The packaging of munin master
determines whether a configuration for your httpd is installed and
activated.

On Debian, symlinks to enable plugins are installed by default, and an
apache2 configuration is automatically activated. So, on Debian, if
your httpd is publicly-accessible, the munin pages and CGI will be
publicly-accessible.

though on Debian, apache is only accessable on localhost per default.

I believe I fixed the bug in r4825, since :
- url with query string aren't stored permanently anymore.
- /tmp isn't used anymore per default (to fix #668536)

Could you confirm that ?

OTOH, the issue about very big imgs that gets the cgi into swapping
isn't the same bug to be.

As Helmut noticed, there is already a size cap in rrd, so do I still
need implement one in munin ? If yes, would you mind to file another
bugreport (for RAM exhaustion) ?

Thx !

I believe I fixed the bug in r4825, since :
- url with query string aren't stored permanently anymore.
- /tmp isn't used anymore per default (to fix #668536)

Could you confirm that ?

OTOH, the issue about very big imgs that gets the cgi into swapping
isn't the same bug to be.

As Helmut noticed, there is already a size cap in rrd, so do I still
need implement one in munin ? If yes, would you mind to file another
bugreport (for RAM exhaustion) ?

Thx !

The packaging of munin node determines whether it will install
symlinks for enabling plugins. The packaging of munin master
determines whether a configuration for your httpd is installed and
activated.

On Debian, symlinks to enable plugins are installed by default, and an
apache2 configuration is automatically activated. So, on Debian, if
your httpd is publicly-accessible, the munin pages and CGI will be
publicly-accessible.

Please use CVE-2012-2147 for this issue (specifying the size = lots of
