Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4381:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- MediaWiki was saving user passwords in the local database even when an external authentication mechanism (like LDAP) was in use. This occurred because core MediaWiki did not properly check or enforce whether an authentication plugin intended to handle password storage, instead of core.
- Furthermore, when an authentication plugin returned 'false' in its 'strict' function, older passwords stored in the local database for users that didn't exist in the external system could be used indefinitely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Storage of Passwords:** Passwords were stored in the local MediaWiki database, regardless of whether an external authentication system was used.
- **Bypass of External Authentication:** A failure in the strict authentication function allowed usage of old local passwords even if those accounts did not exist in the external authentication system anymore
- **Data Leakage:** The stored passwords could be exposed if the MediaWiki installation was compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially gain access to user accounts by exploiting leaked password hashes or by using old, cached passwords if the external authentication failed.
- **Exposure of LDAP Passwords:**  A compromised MediaWiki installation could leak sensitive LDAP passwords.
- **Circumvention of Authentication Policies:**  The bypass of external authentication allowed use of old passwords indefinitely, undermining intended authentication policies.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised MediaWiki Installation:** An attacker could gain access to the MediaWiki database via SQL injection or by other means and extract the stored passwords.
- **Network Attack (Man in the Middle):** If there was not proper encryption, attackers could potentially intercept password data during the login process when the external authentication was failing.
- **Local System Access:** A local attacker with access to the server and the database could retrieve the stored passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the MediaWiki Database:** The attacker needs to gain access to the database, which could be done remotely or locally, depending on the vulnerabilities of the setup.
- **Potential Compromise of MediaWiki Server:** If the attack involves a network vector, the attacker may first need to compromise the server.
- **Knowledge of External Authentication Failure:** If exploiting the old password issue, the attacker would need to know the circumstances of when the authentication plugin returns false

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability affects MediaWiki versions before 1.18.5 and 1.19.x before 1.19.2.
*   The fix involves modifying the core code to respect the AuthPlugin's decision on password storage.
*   Administrators are advised to clean up the data leakage by purging user passwords in the local database after applying the patch. If using a mix of local and external authentication, administrators would need to manually determine which users should have their passwords purged.

This vulnerability highlights the importance of secure password management practices, especially when integrating with external authentication systems.
