Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are created within sandboxes in Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey. When an XHR object was created in a sandbox, it incorrectly inherited the system principal (full privileges) instead of the intended sandbox principal (restricted privileges).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Principal Inheritance:** The core weakness is the improper inheritance of the system principal by XHR objects created in sandboxes. This violates the principle of least privilege.
- **Bypass of Sandbox Security:**  Sandboxes are meant to isolate untrusted code and limit its capabilities. By assigning system principal to XHR objects, the sandbox's security is circumvented.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker could potentially perform CSRF attacks, forcing a user's browser to make requests to a different website with elevated privileges.
- **Information Theft:** Malicious add-ons running untrusted code within a sandbox could steal sensitive information by making unauthorized requests using the XHR object with system privileges.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining system privileges through the XHR object, untrusted code could potentially escalate its access and perform actions it shouldn't be authorized to do.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Add-ons:** Attackers could distribute malicious add-ons that exploit this vulnerability. These add-ons, while running within a sandbox, could create XHR objects with system privileges and launch attacks.
- **Specially Crafted Web Pages:**  Although less likely directly, a malicious webpage could attempt to trigger this vulnerability if an installed add-on is susceptible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create a Malicious Add-on:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious add-on that exploits the vulnerability.
- **User Must Install the Malicious Add-on:** The victim must install the malicious add-on for the attack to be successful.
- **Javascript must be enabled (for Thunderbird):** Specifically, in Thunderbird's case, javascript must be enabled for this vulnerability to be exploited via crafted email.
- **Potentially Tricking a user into visiting a malicious page:** A malicious webpage could attempt to trigger the vulnerability given certain conditions are met, although a malicious add-on is a more likely scenario.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Gabor Krizsanits, a Mozilla developer.
- The fix involves properly initializing XHR objects with the sandbox principal rather than the system principal. The fix uses the `JS_GetCompartmentPrincipals` and `nsJSPrincipals::get` methods to fetch the appropriate principal.
- This vulnerability is a regression from a previous fix related to how principals are handled in javascript contexts.
- This vulnerability was rated as "high" impact by Mozilla.
- The bug was resolved in Firefox 17, SeaMonkey 2.14, and Thunderbird 17.
- OpenSUSE and Ubuntu also released patches for this vulnerability.
