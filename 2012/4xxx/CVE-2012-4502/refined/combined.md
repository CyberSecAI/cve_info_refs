Package        : chrony
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4502 CVE-2012-4503

Florian Weimer discovered two security problems in the Chrony time
synchronisation software (buffer overflows and use of uninitialised data
in command replies).

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon in 1.24-3+squeeze1 (due to a technical restriction in the archive
processing scripts the two updates cannot be released together).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24-3.1+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=846392#c0)  Florian Weimer    2012-08-07 16:19:02 UTC  ``` In pktlength.c:PKL_CommandLength(), the computation in the REQ_SUBNETS_ACCESSED/REQ_CLIENT_ACCESSES cases can overflow, and PKL_CommandLength can return a negative value.  As a result, the subsequent attempt to hash the packet triggers an out-of-bounds read, segmentation fault, and daemon crash.  Attacks are possible from IP addresses listed in the cmdallow ACL (restricted to localhost by default) by sending UDP packets to port 323; no additional authentication is required.  The length computations in pktlength.c:PKL_ReplyLength() should be guarded against overflow, too.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=846392#c25)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 07:47:04 UTC  ``` Chrony upstream has released 1.29 version correcting the following two security flaws:  * CVE-2012-4502: Buffer overflow when processing crafted command packets    When the length of the REQ_SUBNETS_ACCESSED, REQ_CLIENT_ACCESSES   command requests and the RPY_SUBNETS_ACCESSED, RPY_CLIENT_ACCESSES,   RPY_CLIENT_ACCESSES_BY_INDEX, RPY_MANUAL_LIST command replies is   calculated, the number of items stored in the packet is not validated.    A crafted command request/reply can be used to crash the server/client.   Only clients allowed by cmdallow (by default only localhost) can crash   the server.    With chrony versions 1.25 and 1.26 this bug has a smaller security   impact as the server requires the clients to be authenticated in order   to process the subnet and client accesses commands. In 1.27 and 1.28,   however, the invalid calculated length is included also in the   authentication check which may cause another crash.  * CVE-2012-4503: Uninitialized data in command replies    The RPY_SUBNETS_ACCESSED and RPY_CLIENT_ACCESSES command replies can   contain uninitalized data from stack when the client logging is disabled   or a bad subnet is requested. These commands were never used by chronyc   and they require the client to be authenticated since version 1.25.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=846392#c26)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 07:58:18 UTC  ``` Upstream patches:   <http://git.tuxfamily.org/chrony/chrony.git/?p=chrony/chrony.git;a=commitdiff;h=7712455d9aa33d0db0945effaa07e900b85987b1> (for [CVE-2013-4502](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4502))    <http://git.tuxfamily.org/chrony/chrony.git/?p=chrony/chrony.git;a=commitdiff;h=c6fdeeb6bb0b17dc28c19ae492c4a1c498e54ea3> (for [CVE-2013-4503](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-4503))   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=846392#c28)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 08:05:54 UTC  ``` These issues affect the (latest) versions of the chrony package, as shipped with Fedora release of 18, 19, Fedora EPEL-5, and Fedora EPEL-6.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
