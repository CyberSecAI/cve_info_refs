1.1
A arbitrary file traversal vulnerability is detected in Flatnux CMS 2011 08.09.2.
The vulnerability allows an admin of the cms system to access server file components.
Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized execution and access to system files
which expands the web server rights of a restricted user.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] controlcenter.php > opt=contents/Files&dir=
1.2
A persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in Flatnux CMS 2011 08.09.2.

context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Comment News - Title News > Name of Folders in Gallery
1.3
A cross site request forgery vulnerability is detected in Flatnux CMS 2011 08.09.2. The bugs allow remote
attackers with high required user inter action to edit user accounts. Successful exploitation can lead to account access.
