Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The VeriCentre web application contains a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `TerminalId`, `ModelName`, and `ApplicationName` parameters are vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **CWE-89:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').

**Impact of Exploitation:** A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to issue arbitrary commands against the database. This could lead to data theft, modification, or deletion, potentially compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
*   **Web Application Interface:** The attack targets the web application interface of VeriCentre.
*   **Specific Parameters:** The `TerminalId`, `ModelName`, and `ApplicationName` parameters are injection points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the web application to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Cory Eubanks of Clear Skies Security LLC.
*   The vendor has addressed the vulnerability in Web Console 2.2 build 36 and higher. Users are recommended to update to this version.
*   Restricting access to the application does not prevent SQL injection attacks since the attack comes as an SQL request from a legitimate user's host.
