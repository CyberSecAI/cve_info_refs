#### Vulnerability Note VU#180091

Original Release Date: 2012-11-06 | Last Revised: 2012-11-06

### Overview

The VeriCentre web application contains a SQL injection vulnerability.

### Description

| [CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html): Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')  The VeriCentre web application contains a SQL injection vulnerability within the TerminalId, ModelName, and ApplicationName parameters.Additional information can be found in the vulnerability reporter's [advisory](http://www.clearskies.net/documents/css-advisory-css1211-vericentre.pdf). |
| --- |

| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**The vendor has stated that these vulnerabilities have been addressed in Web Console 2.2 build 36. The vendor recommends that users update to Web Console 2.2 build 36 or higher. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent SQLi attacks since the attack comes as an SQL request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
