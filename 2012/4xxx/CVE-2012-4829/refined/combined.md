##### **Tips**

To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

# Security Bulletin: IBM XIV Storage System Gen3 (CVE-2011-4619, CVE-2011-4576, CVE-2011-3210, CVE-2012-4829)

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

Certain network-based attacks can cause the administration interface server to reboot (CVE-2011-4619 and CVE-2011-3210). Control data may be leaked from pad regions of cipher blocks (CVE-2011-4576).

## Content

**VULNERABILITY DETAILS:**

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-4619

**DESCRIPTION:** The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before 1.0.0f does not properly handle handshake restarts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via unspecified vectors.

**CVSS:**

**CVSS Base Score:** 4.3

**CVSS Temporal Score:**  See <http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/72132> for the current score

**CVSS Environmental Score\*:** Unknown

**CVSS Vector:** (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

**AFFECTED PRODUCTS:** IBM XIV Storage System Gen3 (MTMN 2810 and 2812) running releases 11.0 through 11.1.1.

**REMEDIATION:** Upgrade to Release 11.2 or higher code.

**VENDOR FIX(ES):** For XIV Gen 3 systems running a release lower than 11.2 contact IBM to have your system upgraded to release 11.2 or higher.

**WORKAROUND(S):** None known, apply fixes.

**MITIGATION(S):** Limit network access to the XIV system’s management interfaces.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-4576

**DESCRIPTION:** The SSL 3.0 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before 1.0.0f does not properly initialize data structures for block cipher padding, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by decrypting the padding data sent by an SSL peer.

**CVSS:**

**CVSS Base Score:** 5

**CVSS Temporal Score:** See <http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/72130> for the current score

**CVSS Environmental Score\*:** Unknown

**CVSS Vector:** (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

**AFFECTED PRODUCTS:** IBM XIV Storage System Gen3 (MTMN 2810 and 2812) running releases 11.0 through 11.1.1.

**REMEDIATION:** Upgrade to Release 11.2 or higher code.

**VENDOR FIX(ES):** For XIV Gen 3 systems running a release lower than 11.2 contact IBM to have your system upgraded to release 11.2 or higher.

**WORKAROUND(S):** None known, apply fixes.

**MITIGATION(S):** Limit network access to the XIV system’s management interfaces.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-3210

**DESCRIPTION:** The ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite functionality in OpenSSL 0.9.8 through 0.9.8r and 1.0.x before 1.0.0e does not ensure thread safety during processing of handshake messages from clients, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via out-of-order messages that violate the TLS protocol.

**CVSS:**

**CVSS Base Score:** 5

**CVSS Temporal Score:** See <http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/69614> for the current score

**CVSS Environmental Score\*:** Unknown

**CVSS Vector:** (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

**AFFECTED PRODUCTS:** IBM XIV Storage System Gen3 (MTMN 2810 and 2812) running releases 11.0 through 11.1.1

**REMEDIATION:** Upgrade to Release 11.2 or higher code.

**VENDOR FIX(ES):** For XIV Gen 3 systems running a release lower than 11.2 contact IBM to have your system upgraded to release 11.2 or higher.

**WORKAROUND(S):** None known, apply fixes.

**MITIGATION(S):** Limit network access to the XIV system’s management interfaces.

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-4829

**DESCRIPTION:** The default X509v3 certificate provided with XIV Storage System Gen3 is insufficient to properly authenticate the system to a client connecting via to a management client

**CVSS:**

**CVSS Base Score:** 4.3

**CVSS Temporal Score:** See <http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/78860> for the current score

**CVSS Environmental Score\*:** Undefined

**CVSS Vector:** (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

**AFFECTED PRODUCTS:** IBM XIV Storage System Gen3 (MTMN 2810 and 2812

**REMEDIATION:** Upgrade to Release 11.2 or higher code and install a new certificate

**VENDOR FIX(ES):** For XIV Gen 3 systems running a release lower than 11.2 contact IBM to have your system upgraded to release 11.2 or higher.

**WORKAROUND(S):** None known, apply fixes and replace certificate.

**MITIGATION(S):** Limit network access to the XIV system’s management interfaces.
