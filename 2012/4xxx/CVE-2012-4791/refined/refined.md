Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-4791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Microsoft Exchange Server's improper handling of RSS feeds. Specifically, the way Exchange processes and manages these feeds causes a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of RSS Feeds:** The core issue is the flawed logic in how Exchange Server parses and processes RSS feeds. This flaw allows specially crafted feeds to trigger a denial of service.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows a malicious RSS feed to render the Information Store service on the Exchange server unresponsive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation leads to the Information Store service becoming unresponsive, effectively halting user access to their mailboxes. The service remains unresponsive until forcibly terminated.
- **Database Dismount and Potential Corruption:** The unresponsive state of the Information Store service can cause Exchange databases to dismount and may potentially lead to database corruption, impacting user mailboxes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **RSS Feed Injection:** An attacker needs a valid email account on the affected Exchange server.
- **Crafted RSS Feed:** The attacker must create a specially crafted RSS feed designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Subscription:** The attacker then subscribes to the crafted RSS feed.
- **Processing Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered when the Exchange server attempts to handle the malicious RSS feed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Email Account:** The attacker requires a valid email account on the targeted Exchange server.
- **Ability to Create RSS Feeds:** The attacker must be able to create and host or inject malicious RSS feeds.
- **No Authentication Bypass:** The attacker does not need to bypass any authentication on the Exchange server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is a denial of service; it does not allow for remote code execution or privilege escalation.
- The provided documents indicate that this vulnerability was not publicly known before the security bulletin was released.
- Microsoft provides a fix by correcting the way Exchange Server handles RSS feeds.
- There are no identified workarounds for this vulnerability other than applying the patch.
