## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2784126)

Published: December 11, 2012

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server. The most severe vulnerabilities are in Microsoft Exchange Server WebReady Document Viewing and could allow remote code execution in the security context of the transcoding service on the Exchange server if a user previews a specially crafted file using Outlook Web App (OWA). The transcoding service in Exchange that is used for WebReady Document Viewing is running in the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by updating the affected Oracle Outside In libraries to a non-vulnerable version. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerabilities entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

## Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Exchange Server through the WebReady Document Viewing feature. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution as the LocalService account if a user views a specially crafted file through Outlook Web Access in a browser. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run code on the affected server, but only as the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

To view these vulnerabilities as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-3214](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3214) and [CVE-2012-3217](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3217).

#### Mitigating Factors for Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The transcoding service in Exchange that is used for WebReady Document Viewing is running in the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

#### Workarounds for Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable WebReady document view**

  1. Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
  2. Issue the following PowerShell command:

```
Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010'} |
Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$False -
WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$False

```
```
**Impact of workaround.** OWA users may not be able to preview the content of email attachments.

**How do I undo the workaround?**

1.  Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
2.  Issue the following PowerShell command:

```
```
Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010'} |
Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$True -
WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$True

```

**Note** The above steps assume the Exchange Administrator had previously allowed WebReady Documents to be viewed on both Public and Private logons to OWA. The appropriate $True or $False value should be used to set the desired behavior based upon user logon.

#### FAQ for Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities

**What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?**

These are a remote code execution vulnerabilities.

**What causes the vulnerabilities?**

The WebReady service parses files using the Oracle Outside In libraries in order to provide a preview of the document in the browser. The vulnerabilities are caused when WebReady Document Viewer is used to preview a specially crafted file.

**What** **are the** **Oracle Outside In** **libraries?**

In Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, Outlook Web App (OWA) users are provided with a feature called WebReady Document Viewing that allows users to view certain attachments as a webpage instead of relying on local applications to open/view it. The Oracle Outside In libraries are used by the conversion process in the server backend to support the WebReady feature. Microsoft licenses these libraries from Oracle.

**What is WebReady Document** **Viewing?**

WebReady Document Viewing allows users to view certain attachments as a webpage. Microsoft Exchange 2007 and Microsoft Exchange 2010 do the conversion, so the user doesn't need anything other than a web browser.

**What might an attacker use these vulnerabilities** **to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code as LocalService on the affected Exchange server. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

**How could an attacker exploit these vulnerabilities?**

An attacker could send an email message containing a specially crafted file to a user on an affected version of Exchange. When the user previews the specially crafted file in the browser, arbitrary code could be run on the Exchange server. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or take any other action that the server process has access to do.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Exchange server systems are primarily at risk from these vulnerabilities.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by updating the affected Oracle Outside In libraries to a non-vulnerable version.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had these vulnerabilities** **been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. These vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed. They have been assigned the following Common Vulnerability and Exposure numbers:

* [CVE-2012-3214](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3214)
* [CVE-2012-3217](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3217)

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that these vulnerabilities were** **being** **exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## RSS Feed May Cause Exchange DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2012-4791

For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723): Summary list of monthly detection and deployment guidance articles.

**Note** If you have used an Administrative Installation Point (AIP) for deploying Office 2003, you may not be able to deploy the update using SMS if you have updated the AIP from the original baseline. For more information, see the **Office Administrative Installation Point** heading in this section.

**Office Administrative Installation Point**

If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system.

* For supported versions of Microsoft Office 2003, see [Creating an Administrative Installation Point](https://office.microsoft.com/ork2003/ha011401931033.aspx). For more information on how to change the source for a client computer from an updated administrative installation point to an Office 2003 original baseline source or Service Pack 3 (SP3), see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 902349](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/902349).

  **Note** If you plan to manage software updates centrally from an updated administrative image, you can find more information in the article, [Distributing Office 2003 Product Updates](https://office.microsoft.com/ork2003/ha011402381033.aspx?pid=ch011480761033).
* For creating a network installation point for supported versions of Microsoft Office, see [Create a network installation point for Microsoft Office](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179063.aspx).

  **Note** If you plan to manage security updates centrally, use Windows Server Update Services. For more information about how to deploy security updates for Microsoft Office, see the [Windows Server Update Services website](https://technet.microsoft.com/wsus/default.aspx).

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc749197) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

# High version bucket on the Exchange Server 2010 mailbox server

Applies ToExchange Server 2010 Enterprise Exchange Server 2010 Standard

## Symptoms

On an Exchange 2010 mailbox server, the Information Store service may become unresponsive and eventually dismount and/or be forcibly terminated. When this problem occurs, Exchange users keeps receiving an RPC error that Outlook is trying to contact Exchange. If you use Performance Monitor to view the values for Version Buckets Allocated under MSExchange Database -> Instances, you will find that the value increases constantly for one or more databases until those databases eventually fail.

Event 10027 may be logged when this problem occurs.

Event ID: 10027 Source: MSExchangeIS Description: There are 5 RPC requests for the mailbox " <User> " on the database " <Database> " that have taken an abnormally long time to complete. This may be indicative of performance issues with your server.

## Cause

This problem occurs because of a bug that causes the Information Store service to enter an infinite loop when a database page is updated.

## Resolution

A supported hotfix is now available from Microsoft. However, it is intended to correct only the problem that is described in this article.
