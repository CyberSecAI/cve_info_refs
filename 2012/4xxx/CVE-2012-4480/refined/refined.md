Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**

- The `daemonize` function in `src/momd` incorrectly calls `os.umask(0)` when creating the daemon process. This results in the PID file being created with world-writable permissions. This behavior was traced back to incorrect example code in APUE.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **World-writable PID file:** The mom daemon creates a PID file in `/var/run` that is writable by any user on the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Process manipulation:** A malicious local attacker could modify the PID file. Upon a mom shutdown or restart, the system might attempt to kill a process specified by the attacker within the modified PID file, leading to the termination of an unintended process that the attacker would not normally have permissions to terminate.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local access:** The attack requires a malicious actor to have local access to the system where the mom daemon is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to write to the PID file, which is located in `/var/run`. Because of the world-writable permissions, any local user can write to the file.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix involves removing the call to `os.umask(0)` in the daemonization code.
- The fix was applied upstream.
- Updates were created for Fedora 17, Fedora 18, and EPEL6.
- The vulnerability is considered low priority and low severity.
