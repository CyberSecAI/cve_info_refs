| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c0)  Florian Weimer    2012-10-04 15:38:32 UTC  ``` daemonize in src/momd calls os.umask(0) when creating the daemon process.  As a result, the PID file is world-writable.  This dates back to incorrect example code in APUE.  It's probably best to just drop the umask call.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-04 17:38:50 UTC  ``` This is indeed a security concern.  I'll be filing a CVE bug for this.  Adam, am I correct in assuming that you are upstream for mom?  I don't believe this will require much of an embargo; it's quite trivial to fix (removing os.umask() is sufficient to fix it).  I will, however, file our CVE bug as an embargoed bug for the time being, until we've heard back from you as to how you would to handle it.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c2)  Adam Litke    2012-10-04 18:00:51 UTC  ``` Hi.  Yes, I am upstream for MOM.  I can remove the umask call upstream.  How should we propagate the fix into Fedora?  I can just release a new upstream version which I had been planning to do soon anyway.  Is that okay?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c3)  Adam Litke    2012-10-04 21:52:39 UTC  ``` Fix comitted: <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/8366/>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c4)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-05 15:01:17 UTC  ``` Thanks, Adam.  Can you reference the CVE in any changelogs (maybe change the git commit)?  The CVE assigned is [CVE-2012-4480](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-4480).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-05 15:06:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c2)) > Hi.  Yes, I am upstream for MOM.  I can remove the umask call upstream.  How > should we propagate the fix into Fedora?  I can just release a new upstream > version which I had been planning to do soon anyway.  Is that okay?  A new upstream version with the fix would be a fine way to resolve this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-05 15:10:44 UTC  ``` I'm making this bug public and into a tracking bug now that the commit is already public.  Adam, please note that we would desire the fix in all supported versions of Fedora; it also seems that EPEL6 provides mom as well (although that will get a separate tracking bug).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c7)  Fedora Update System    2012-10-05 21:01:56 UTC  ``` mom-0.3.0-1.fc17 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 17. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/mom-0.3.0-1.fc17>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c8)  Fedora Update System    2012-10-05 21:03:41 UTC  ``` mom-0.3.0-1.fc18 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 18. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/mom-0.3.0-1.fc18>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c9)  Fedora Update System    2012-10-05 21:04:40 UTC  ``` mom-0.3.0-1.el6 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 6. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/mom-0.3.0-1.el6>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c10)  Fedora Update System    2012-10-06 03:46:58 UTC  ``` Package mom-0.3.0-1.fc17: * should fix your issue, * was pushed to the Fedora 17 testing repository, * should be available at your local mirror within two days. Update it with: # su -c 'yum update --enablerepo=updates-testing mom-0.3.0-1.fc17' as soon as you are able to. Please go to the following url: <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2012-15496/mom-0.3.0-1.fc17> then log in and leave karma (feedback).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=863178#c11)  Fedora Update System    2012-12-20 15:50:49 UTC  ``` mom-0.3.0-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=863486#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-05 15:05:56 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team found [1] that mom created PID files in /var/run as world-writable.  This could allow a malicious local attacker to edit the PID file and on mom shutdown or restart, to kill some other process than the mom process, that they would not normally have access to terminate.  This is fixed upstream [2].  [1] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=863178](show_bug.cgi?id=863178 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-4480 mom: world-writable PID file [fedora-all]") [2] <http://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/8366/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=863486#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-05 15:11:37 UTC  ``` Created mom tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 863489](show_bug.cgi?id=863489 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-4480 mom: creates world-writable pid file [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=863486#c2)  Adam Litke    2014-01-02 19:33:44 UTC  ``` Fixed as of 0.3.0-1.   ``` |  |
