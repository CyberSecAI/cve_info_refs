### [WordPress 4.5.2 and Zingiri Web Shop](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpress-452-and-zingiri-web-shop/)

I installed this plugin on my multi-site.
Activated it both locally and network activate.
No controls of any kind could be found anywhere with any configuration. As if the plug simply didn’t exist except on the PlugIns page of WP.
Zingiri’s home page and support is fairly useless.
Trashing plug forthwith
