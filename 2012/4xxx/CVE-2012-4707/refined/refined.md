- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer. The 3S CODESYS Gateway-Server can read or write to a memory location outside the intended buffer boundary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper memory access control, specifically writing to or reading from out-of-bounds memory locations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may execute arbitrary code, alter the intended control flow, read sensitive information, or cause a system crash (Denial of Service).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted packet to the 3S CODESYS Gateway-Server over TCP port 1211.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server on TCP port 1211.
