Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-4945:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The application has several pages that could be exploited to allow an unauthenticated user to perform actions in the application that only an authenticated user should be able to perform. This points to a lack of proper access controls and authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-77):** The specific vulnerability is the ability for unauthenticated users to perform actions that should be restricted to authenticated users. This could be a form of command injection, but it's not explicitly stated, though the document classifies it as such, it does not clearly say how this could be exploited as command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker could perform actions within the application that should be restricted to authenticated users. This could lead to a variety of consequences depending on the specific actions that can be performed, such as modifying data, or potentially gaining administrative access.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exposed through several web pages which can be accessed without prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web pages. They don't need to have any pre-existing credentials or authenticated access to exploit the vulnerability.
