The Python keyring library provides an easy way to access the
system keyring service from python. It can be used in any
application that needs safe password storage.

These recommended keyring backends are supported:

* macOS [Keychain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_%28software%29)
* Freedesktop [Secret Service](http://standards.freedesktop.org/secret-service/) supports many DE including
  GNOME (requires [secretstorage](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/secretstorage))
* KDE4 & KDE5 [KWallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWallet)
  (requires [dbus](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dbus-python))
* [Windows Credential Locker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/credential-locker)

Other keyring implementations are available through [Third-Party Backends](#third-party-backends).

## Installation - Linux

On Linux, the KWallet backend relies on [dbus-python](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus-python), which does not always
install correctly when using pip (compilation is needed). For best results,
install dbus-python as a system package.

## Compatibility - macOS

macOS keychain supports macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later requires Python 3.8.7
or later with the “universal2” binary. See
[#525](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/525) for details.

## Using Keyring

The basic usage of keyring is pretty simple: just call
keyring.set\_password and keyring.get\_password:

```
>>> import keyring
>>> keyring.set_password("system", "username", "password")
>>> keyring.get_password("system", "username")
'password'
```
### Command-line Utility

Keyring supplies a keyring command which is installed with the
package. After installing keyring in most environments, the
command should be available for setting, getting, and deleting
passwords. For more usage information, invoke with no arguments
or with --help as so:

```
$ keyring --help
$ keyring set system username
Password for 'username' in 'system':
$ keyring get system username
password
```

The command-line functionality is also exposed as an executable
package, suitable for invoking from Python like so:

```
$ python -m keyring --help
$ python -m keyring set system username
Password for 'username' in 'system':
$ python -m keyring get system username
password
```

### Tab Completion

If installed via a package manager (apt, pacman, nix, homebrew, etc),
these shell completions may already have been distributed with the package
(no action required).

Keyring provides tab completion if the completion extra is installed:

```
$ pip install 'keyring[completion]'
```

Then, generate shell completions, something like:

```
$ keyring --print-completion bash | sudo tee /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/keyring
$ keyring --print-completion zsh | sudo tee /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_keyring
$ keyring --print-completion tcsh | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/keyring.csh
```

**Note**: the path of /usr/share is mainly for GNU/Linux. For other OSs,
consider:

* macOS (Homebrew x86): /usr/local/share
* macOS (Homebrew ARM): /opt/homebrew/share
* Android (Termux): /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/share
* Windows (mingw64 of msys2): /mingw64/share
* …

After installing the shell completions, enable them following your shell’s
recommended instructions. e.g.:

* bash: install [bash-completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion),
  and ensure . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash\_completion in ~/.bashrc.
* zsh: ensure autoload -Uz compinit && compinit appears in ~/.zshrc,
  then grep -w keyring ~/.zcompdump to verify keyring appears, indicating
  it was installed correctly.

## Configuring

The python keyring lib contains implementations for several backends. The
library will attempt to
automatically choose the most suitable backend for the current
environment. Users may also specify the preferred keyring in a
config file or by calling the set\_keyring() function.

### Config file path

The configuration is stored in a file named “keyringrc.cfg”
found in a platform-specific location. To determine
where the config file is stored, run keyring diagnose.

### Config file content

To specify a keyring backend, set the **default-keyring** option to the
full path of the class for that backend, such as
keyring.backends.macOS.Keyring.

If **keyring-path** is indicated, keyring will add that path to the Python
module search path before loading the backend.

For example, this config might be used to load the
SimpleKeyring from the simplekeyring module in
the ./demo directory (not implemented):

```
[backend]
default-keyring=simplekeyring.SimpleKeyring
keyring-path=demo
```

## Third-Party Backends

In addition to the backends provided by the core keyring package for
the most common and secure use cases, there
are additional keyring backend implementations available for other
use cases. Simply install them to make them available:

* [keyrings.cryptfile](https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.cryptfile)
  - Encrypted text file storage.
* [keyrings.alt](https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.alt) - “alternate”,
  possibly-insecure backends, originally part of the core package, but
  available for opt-in.
* [gsheet-keyring](https://pypi.org/project/gsheet-keyring)
  - a backend that stores secrets in a Google Sheet. For use with
  [ipython-secrets](https://pypi.org/project/ipython-secrets).
* [bitwarden-keyring](https://pypi.org/project/bitwarden-keyring/)
  - a backend that stores secrets in the [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
  password manager.
* [onepassword-keyring](https://pypi.org/project/onepassword-keyring/)
  - a backend that stores secrets in the [1Password](https://1password.com/) password manager.
* [sagecipher](https://pypi.org/project/sagecipher) - an encryption
  backend which uses the ssh agent protocol’s signature operation to
  derive the cipher key.
* [keyrings.osx\_keychain\_keys](https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.osx-keychain-keys)
  - OSX keychain key-management, for private, public, and symmetric keys.
* [keyring\_pass.PasswordStoreBackend](https://github.com/nazarewk/keyring_pass)
  + Password Store (pass) backend for python’s keyring
* [keyring\_jeepney](https://pypi.org/project/keyring_jeepney) - a
  pure Python backend using the secret service DBus API for desktop
  Linux (requires keyring<24).

## Write your own keyring backend

The interface for the backend is defined by keyring.backend.KeyringBackend.
Every backend should derive from that base class and define a priority
attribute and three functions: get\_password(), set\_password(), and
delete\_password(). The get\_credential() function may be defined if
desired.

See the backend module for more detail on the interface of this class.

Keyring employs entry points to allow any third-party package to implement
backends without any modification to the keyring itself. Those interested in
creating new backends are encouraged to create new, third-party packages
in the keyrings namespace, in a manner modeled by the [keyrings.alt
package](https://github.com/jaraco/keyrings.alt). See the
setup.cfg file
in that project for hints on how to create the requisite entry points.
Backends that prove essential may be considered for inclusion in the core
library, although the ease of installing these third-party packages should
mean that extensions may be readily available.

To create an extension for Keyring, please submit a pull request to
have your extension mentioned as an available extension.

## Runtime Configuration

Keyring additionally allows programmatic configuration of the
backend calling the api set\_keyring(). The indicated backend
will subsequently be used to store and retrieve passwords.

To invoke set\_keyring:

```
# define a new keyring class which extends the KeyringBackend
import keyring.backend

class TestKeyring(keyring.backend.KeyringBackend):
    """A test keyring which always outputs the same password
    """
    priority = 1

    def set_password(self, servicename, username, password):
        pass

    def get_password(self, servicename, username):
        return "password from TestKeyring"

    def delete_password(self, servicename, username):
        pass

# set the keyring for keyring lib
keyring.set_keyring(TestKeyring())

# invoke the keyring lib
try:
    keyring.set_password("demo-service", "tarek", "passexample")
    print("password stored successfully")
except keyring.errors.PasswordSetError:
    print("failed to store password")
print("password", keyring.get_password("demo-service", "tarek"))
```

## Disabling Keyring

In many cases, uninstalling keyring will never be necessary.
Especially on Windows and macOS, the behavior of keyring is
usually degenerate, meaning it will return empty values to
the caller, allowing the caller to fall back to some other
behavior.

In some cases, the default behavior of keyring is undesirable and
it would be preferable to disable the keyring behavior altogether.
There are several mechanisms to disable keyring:

* Uninstall keyring. Most applications are tolerant to keyring
  not being installed. Uninstalling keyring should cause those
  applications to fall back to the behavior without keyring.
  This approach affects the Python environment where keyring
  would otherwise have been installed.
* Configure the Null keyring in the environment. Set
  PYTHON\_KEYRING\_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
  in the environment, and the Null (degenerate) backend
  will be used. This approach affects all uses of Keyring where
  that variable is set.
* Permanently configure the Null keyring for the user by running
  keyring --disable or python -m keyring --disable.
  This approach affects all uses of keyring for that user.

## Altering Keyring Behavior

Keyring provides a mechanism to alter the keyring’s behavior through
environment variables. Each backend implements a
KeyringBackend.set\_properties\_from\_env, which
when invoked will find all environment variables beginning with
KEYRING\_PROPERTY\_{NAME} and will set a property for each
{NAME.lower()} on the keyring. This method is invoked during
initialization for the default/configured keyring.

This mechanism may be used to set some useful values on various
keyrings, including:

* keychain; macOS, path to an alternate keychain file
* appid; Linux/SecretService, alternate ID for the application

## Using Keyring on Ubuntu 16.04

The following is a complete transcript for installing keyring in a
virtual environment on Ubuntu 16.04. No config file was used:

```
$ sudo apt install python3-venv libdbus-glib-1-dev
$ cd /tmp
$ pyvenv py3
$ source py3/bin/activate
$ pip install -U pip
$ pip install secretstorage dbus-python
$ pip install keyring
$ python
>>> import keyring
>>> keyring.get_keyring()
<keyring.backends.SecretService.Keyring object at 0x7f9b9c971ba8>
>>> keyring.set_password("system", "username", "password")
>>> keyring.get_password("system", "username")
'password'
```

## Using Keyring on headless Linux systems

It is possible to use the SecretService backend on Linux systems without
X11 server available (only D-Bus is required). In this case:

* Install the [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring) daemon.
* Start a D-Bus session, e.g. run dbus-run-session -- sh and run
  the following commands inside that shell.
* Run gnome-keyring-daemon with --unlock option. The description of
  that option says:

  > Read a password from stdin, and use it to unlock the login keyring
  > or create it if the login keyring does not exist.

  When that command is started, enter a password into stdin and
  press Ctrl+D (end of data). After that, the daemon will fork into
  the background (use --foreground option to block).
* Now you can use the SecretService backend of Keyring. Remember to
  run your application in the same D-Bus session as the daemon.

## Using Keyring on headless Linux systems in a Docker container

It is possible to use keyring with the SecretService backend in Docker containers as well.
All you need to do is install the necessary dependencies and add the –privileged flag
to avoid any Operation not permitted errors when attempting to unlock the system’s keyring.

The following is a complete transcript for installing keyring on a Ubuntu 18:04 container:

```
docker run -it -d --privileged ubuntu:18.04

$ apt-get update
$ apt install -y gnome-keyring python3-venv python3-dev
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate # source a virtual environment to avoid polluting your system
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
$ pip3 install keyring
$ dbus-run-session -- sh # this will drop you into a new D-bus shell
$ echo 'somecredstorepass' | gnome-keyring-daemon --unlock # unlock the system's keyring

$ python
>>> import keyring
>>> keyring.get_keyring()
<keyring.backends.SecretService.Keyring object at 0x7f9b9c971ba8>
>>> keyring.set_password("system", "username", "password")
>>> keyring.get_password("system", "username")
'password'
```

## Integration

### API

The keyring lib has a few functions:

* get\_keyring(): Return the currently-loaded keyring implementation.
* get\_password(service, username): Returns the password stored in the
  active keyring. If the password does not exist, it will return None.
* get\_credential(service, username): Return a credential object stored
  in the active keyring. This object contains at least username and
  password attributes for the specified service, where the returned
  username may be different from the argument.
* set\_password(service, username, password): Store the password in the
  keyring.
* delete\_password(service, username): Delete the password stored in
  keyring. If the password does not exist, it will raise an exception.

In all cases, the parameters (service, username, password)
should be Unicode text.

### Exceptions

The keyring lib raises the following exceptions:

* keyring.errors.KeyringError: Base Error class for all exceptions in keyring lib.
* keyring.errors.InitError: Raised when the keyring cannot be initialized.
* keyring.errors.PasswordSetError: Raised when the password cannot be set in the keyring.
* keyring.errors.PasswordDeleteError: Raised when the password cannot be deleted in the keyring.

## Get Involved

* Mailing list: <http://groups.google.com/group/python-keyring>

## Security Considerations

Each built-in backend may have security considerations to understand
before using this library. Authors of tools or libraries utilizing
keyring are encouraged to consider these concerns.

As with any list of known security concerns, this list is not exhaustive.
Additional issues can be added as needed.

* macOS Keychain
  + Any Python script or application can access secrets created by
    keyring from that same Python executable without the operating
    system prompting the user for a password. To cause any specific
    secret to prompt for a password every time it is accessed, locate
    the credential using the Keychain Access application, and in
    the Access Control settings, remove Python from the list
    of allowed applications.
* Freedesktop Secret Service
  + No analysis has been performed
* KDE4 & KDE5 KWallet
  + No analysis has been performed
* Windows Credential Locker
  + No analysis has been performed

## Making Releases

This project makes use of automated releases and continuous
integration. The
simple workflow is to tag a commit and push it to Github. If it
passes tests in CI, it will be automatically deployed to PyPI.

Other things to consider when making a release:

* Check that the changelog is current for the intended release.

## Running Tests

Tests are continuously run in Github Actions.

To run the tests locally, install and invoke
[tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox).

## Background

The project was based on Tarek Ziade’s idea in [this post](http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/pycon-hallway-session-1-a-keyring-library-for-python/). Kang Zhang
initially carried it out as a [Google Summer of Code](http://socghop.appspot.com/) project, and Tarek
mentored Kang on this project.

# USN-1634-1: Python Keyring vulnerabilities

20 November 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Python Keyring.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [python-keyring](/security/cves?package=python-keyring) - store and access your passwords safely

## Details

Dwayne Litzenberger discovered that Python Keyring's CryptedFileKeyring

file format used weak cryptography. A local attacker may use this issue to

brute-force CryptedFileKeyring keyring files. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 11.10 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-4571](/security/CVE-2012-4571))

It was discovered that Python Keyring created keyring files with insecure

permissions. A local attacker could use this issue to access keyring files

belonging to other users.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [python3-keyring](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring)
  -
  [0.9.2-1ubuntu0.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring/0.9.2-1ubuntu0.2)
* [python-keyring](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring)
  -
  [0.9.2-1ubuntu0.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring/0.9.2-1ubuntu0.2)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [python3-keyring](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring)
  -
  [0.9.2-0ubuntu0.12.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring/0.9.2-0ubuntu0.12.04.2)
* [python-keyring](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring)
  -
  [0.9.2-0ubuntu0.12.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring/0.9.2-0ubuntu0.12.04.2)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [python-keyring](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring)
  -
  [0.9.2-0ubuntu0.11.10.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-keyring/0.9.2-0ubuntu0.11.10.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug

fixes, and will migrate existing keyring files to the new format upon first

use.

I got this backtrack when trying to use syncpackage in my up-to-date quantal chroot. I don't know if it's a bug in python-crypto or python-keyring as this error appeared after updating python-crypto to 2.6-1.

Workaround is to downgrade python-crypto to 2.5-2 for now.

Hmm. It looks like python-keyring's CryptedFileKeyring uses weak cryptography, and your pull request effectively asks me to change PyCrypto in order to hide that fact. Obviously, I'm not going to do that, so I've rejected your patch.

This is a terrible way to initialize a cipher from a password:

def \_init\_crypter(self):

        """Init the crypter(using the password of the keyring).

        """

        # check the password file

        if not self.\_check\_file():

            self.\_init\_file()

password = self.\_getpass("Please input your password for the keyring")

if not self.\_auth(password):

            sys.stderr.write("Wrong password for the keyring.\n")

            raise ValueError("Wrong password")

# init the cipher with the password

        from Crypto.Cipher import AES

        # pad to \_BLOCK\_SIZE bytes

        password = password + (\_BLOCK\_SIZE - len(password) % \_BLOCK\_SIZE) \* \

                                                                    \_PADDING

        return AES.new(password, AES.MODE\_CFB)

There's no salt, there's no iteration, and users can't even get the full 256 bits of entropy because their passphrases are limited to 32 printable characters. Digging further, it's trivial to determine the length of each password, and since there's no per-password salting, the storage format reveals which passwords are duplicates of each other.

This code looks like it was written by someone who is unfamiliar with password-based encryption. I suggest that anyone working on secure password-storage software should---at a minimum---read the PKCS#5 v2 standard: ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-5v2/pkcs5v2\_1.pdf

CryptedFileKeyring should store all the passwords together as a single ciphertext, with a unique salt generated every time the file is saved, and the key derived from the user's passphrase (which must not be limited to 32 characters) using a standard salted password-based key derivation function like PBKDF2. (PyCrypto now provides Crypto.Protocol.KDF.PBKDF2).

Yeah, that key generation is pretty terrible.

Fortunately we mostly use python-keyring to talk to GNOME Keyring / KDE Wallet. Hopefully most people do.

I don't think re-using IVs is horrifically insecure here, as most keyrings won't be re-written much, so the key + IV-reuse is minimal. But it is definitily a problem and should be improved.

This is wrong-headed thinking. If I had a dollar for every time a programmer said that and was wrong, I would be rich.

Strong crypto is only strong if you follow the instructions \*exactly\*. Everything else is snake oil.

"the key + IV-reuse is minimal"

The same key and IV are reused for every single password, so you get this:

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("a").encode('hex')

'6a'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("ab").encode('hex')

'6af9'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("ab").encode('hex')

'6af9'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc").encode('hex')

'6af9bb'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc").encode('hex')

'6af9bb'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc").encode('hex')

'6af9bb'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc1").encode('hex')

'6af9bb63'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc2").encode('hex')

'6af9bb60'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc3").encode('hex')

'6af9bb61'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc4").encode('hex')

'6af9bb66'

Notice a pattern in the ciphertexts?

I've implemented a new CryptedFileKeyring based on Dwayne's recommendation and created an upstream pull request: <https://bitbucket.org/kang/python-keyring-lib/pull-request/13/implement-new-cryptedfilekeyring>

I'd really appreciate a review since it's the first time that I've done something with PBKDF2.

Dwayne, I'd like your opinion on a slightly different approach than the one you recommended. Your suggestions to use unique salts and IV are much appreciated, and a definite improvement to the approach.

You suggested also encrypting the entire file. Instead of encrypting the entire file, which has substantial compatibility limitations (see <https://bitbucket.org/kang/python-keyring-lib/issue/64/new-cryptedfilekeyring-doesnt-follow#comment-1530192>). I'd like to retain more granularity in the password file.

Would it be suitable to encrypt each password separately, but have a separate encrypted payload as a reference to validate the user's password when opening the file? This would necessarily mean that several ciphertexts share the same key and one of them has a known plaintext. I seem to recall from my crypto studies that such a situation is potentially less secure, but not necessarily insecure, depending on the algorithm. I'd like your opinion on the approach.

Jamies Strandboge, we already know that Quantal has python-crypto 2.6-2. That doesn't solve the issue at stake here.

The real problen seems to be python-keyring which is still at 0.7.1-1fakesync1and currently broken.

I got this backtrack when trying to use syncpackage in my up-to-date quantal chroot. I don't know if it's a bug in python-crypto or python-keyring as this error appeared after updating python-crypto to 2.6-1.

Workaround is to downgrade python-crypto to 2.5-2 for now.

Hmm. It looks like python-keyring's CryptedFileKeyring uses weak cryptography, and your pull request effectively asks me to change PyCrypto in order to hide that fact. Obviously, I'm not going to do that, so I've rejected your patch.

This is a terrible way to initialize a cipher from a password:

def \_init\_crypter(self):

        """Init the crypter(using the password of the keyring).

        """

        # check the password file

        if not self.\_check\_file():

            self.\_init\_file()

password = self.\_getpass("Please input your password for the keyring")

if not self.\_auth(password):

            sys.stderr.write("Wrong password for the keyring.\n")

            raise ValueError("Wrong password")

# init the cipher with the password

        from Crypto.Cipher import AES

        # pad to \_BLOCK\_SIZE bytes

        password = password + (\_BLOCK\_SIZE - len(password) % \_BLOCK\_SIZE) \* \

                                                                    \_PADDING

        return AES.new(password, AES.MODE\_CFB)

There's no salt, there's no iteration, and users can't even get the full 256 bits of entropy because their passphrases are limited to 32 printable characters. Digging further, it's trivial to determine the length of each password, and since there's no per-password salting, the storage format reveals which passwords are duplicates of each other.

This code looks like it was written by someone who is unfamiliar with password-based encryption. I suggest that anyone working on secure password-storage software should---at a minimum---read the PKCS#5 v2 standard: ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-5v2/pkcs5v2\_1.pdf

CryptedFileKeyring should store all the passwords together as a single ciphertext, with a unique salt generated every time the file is saved, and the key derived from the user's passphrase (which must not be limited to 32 characters) using a standard salted password-based key derivation function like PBKDF2. (PyCrypto now provides Crypto.Protocol.KDF.PBKDF2).

Yeah, that key generation is pretty terrible.

Fortunately we mostly use python-keyring to talk to GNOME Keyring / KDE Wallet. Hopefully most people do.

I don't think re-using IVs is horrifically insecure here, as most keyrings won't be re-written much, so the key + IV-reuse is minimal. But it is definitily a problem and should be improved.

"I don't think [insert arbitrary misuse of crypto here] is horrifically insecure here"

This is wrong-headed thinking. If I had a dollar for every time a programmer said that and was wrong, I would be rich.

Strong crypto is only strong if you follow the instructions \*exactly\*. Everything else is snake oil.

"the key + IV-reuse is minimal"

The same key and IV are reused for every single password, so you get this:

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("a").encode('hex')

'6a'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("ab").encode('hex')

'6af9'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("ab").encode('hex')

'6af9'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc").encode('hex')

'6af9bb'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc").encode('hex')

'6af9bb'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc").encode('hex')

'6af9bb'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc1").encode('hex')

'6af9bb63'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc2").encode('hex')

'6af9bb60'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc3").encode('hex')

'6af9bb61'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc4").encode('hex')

'6af9bb66'

Notice a pattern in the ciphertexts?

Dwayne, I'd like your opinion on a slightly different approach than the one you recommended. Your suggestions to use unique salts and IV are much appreciated, and a definite improvement to the approach.

You suggested also encrypting the entire file. Instead of encrypting the entire file, which has substantial compatibility limitations (see <https://bitbucket.org/kang/python-keyring-lib/issue/64/new-cryptedfilekeyring-doesnt-follow#comment-1530192>). I'd like to retain more granularity in the password file.

Would it be suitable to encrypt each password separately, but have a separate encrypted payload as a reference to validate the user's password when opening the file? This would necessarily mean that several ciphertexts share the same key and one of them has a known plaintext. I seem to recall from my crypto studies that such a situation is potentially less secure, but not necessarily insecure, depending on the algorithm. I'd like your opinion on the approach.

The real problen seems to be python-keyring which is still at 0.7.1-1fakesync1and currently broken.

I got this backtrack when trying to use syncpackage in my up-to-date quantal chroot. I don't know if it's a bug in python-crypto or python-keyring as this error appeared after updating python-crypto to 2.6-1.

Workaround is to downgrade python-crypto to 2.5-2 for now.

Hmm. It looks like python-keyring's CryptedFileKeyring uses weak cryptography, and your pull request effectively asks me to change PyCrypto in order to hide that fact. Obviously, I'm not going to do that, so I've rejected your patch.

This is a terrible way to initialize a cipher from a password:

def \_init\_crypter(self):

        """Init the crypter(using the password of the keyring).

        """

        # check the password file

        if not self.\_check\_file():

            self.\_init\_file()

password = self.\_getpass("Please input your password for the keyring")

if not self.\_auth(password):

            sys.stderr.write("Wrong password for the keyring.\n")

            raise ValueError("Wrong password")

# init the cipher with the password

        from Crypto.Cipher import AES

        # pad to \_BLOCK\_SIZE bytes

        password = password + (\_BLOCK\_SIZE - len(password) % \_BLOCK\_SIZE) \* \

                                                                    \_PADDING

        return AES.new(password, AES.MODE\_CFB)

There's no salt, there's no iteration, and users can't even get the full 256 bits of entropy because their passphrases are limited to 32 printable characters. Digging further, it's trivial to determine the length of each password, and since there's no per-password salting, the storage format reveals which passwords are duplicates of each other.

This code looks like it was written by someone who is unfamiliar with password-based encryption. I suggest that anyone working on secure password-storage software should---at a minimum---read the PKCS#5 v2 standard: ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-5v2/pkcs5v2\_1.pdf

CryptedFileKeyring should store all the passwords together as a single ciphertext, with a unique salt generated every time the file is saved, and the key derived from the user's passphrase (which must not be limited to 32 characters) using a standard salted password-based key derivation function like PBKDF2. (PyCrypto now provides Crypto.Protocol.KDF.PBKDF2).

Hmm. It looks like python-keyring's CryptedFileKeyring uses weak cryptography, and your pull request effectively asks me to change PyCrypto in order to hide that fact. Obviously, I'm not going to do that, so I've rejected your patch.
This is a terrible way to initialize a cipher from a password:
def \_init\_crypter(self):
"""Init the crypter(using the password of the keyring).
"""
# check the password file
if not self.\_check\_file():
self.\_init\_file()
password = self.\_getpass("Please input your password for the keyring")
if not self.\_auth(password):
sys.stderr.write("Wrong password for the keyring.\n")
raise ValueError("Wrong password")
# init the cipher with the password
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
# pad to \_BLOCK\_SIZE bytes
password = password + (\_BLOCK\_SIZE - len(password) % \_BLOCK\_SIZE) \* \
\_PADDING
return AES.new(password, AES.MODE\_CFB)
There's no salt, there's no iteration, and users can't even get the full 256 bits of entropy because their passphrases are limited to 32 printable characters. Digging further, it's trivial to determine the length of each password, and since there's no per-password salting, the storage format reveals which passwords are duplicates of each other.

Yeah, that key generation is pretty terrible.

Fortunately we mostly use python-keyring to talk to GNOME Keyring / KDE Wallet. Hopefully most people do.

I don't think re-using IVs is horrifically insecure here, as most keyrings won't be re-written much, so the key + IV-reuse is minimal. But it is definitily a problem and should be improved.

"I don't think [insert arbitrary misuse of crypto here] is horrifically insecure here"

This is wrong-headed thinking. If I had a dollar for every time a programmer said that and was wrong, I would be rich.

Strong crypto is only strong if you follow the instructions \*exactly\*. Everything else is snake oil.

"the key + IV-reuse is minimal"

The same key and IV are reused for every single password, so you get this:

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("a").encode('hex')

'6a'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("ab").encode('hex')

'6af9'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("ab").encode('hex')

'6af9'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc").encode('hex')

'6af9bb'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc").encode('hex')

'6af9bb'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc").encode('hex')

'6af9bb'

'6af9bb63'

'6af9bb60'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc3").encode('hex')

'6af9bb61'

>>> AES.new("0123456789abcdef", AES.MODE\_CFB, "\0"\*16).encrypt("abc4").encode('hex')

'6af9bb66'

Notice a pattern in the ciphertexts?

I'd really appreciate a review since it's the first time that I've done something with PBKDF2.

Dwayne, I'd like your opinion on a slightly different approach than the one you recommended. Your suggestions to use unique salts and IV are much appreciated, and a definite improvement to the approach.

You suggested also encrypting the entire file. Instead of encrypting the entire file, which has substantial compatibility limitations (see <https://bitbucket.org/kang/python-keyring-lib/issue/64/new-cryptedfilekeyring-doesnt-follow#comment-1530192>). I'd like to retain more granularity in the password file.

Would it be suitable to encrypt each password separately, but have a separate encrypted payload as a reference to validate the user's password when opening the file? This would necessarily mean that several ciphertexts share the same key and one of them has a known plaintext. I seem to recall from my crypto studies that such a situation is potentially less secure, but not necessarily insecure, depending on the algorithm. I'd like your opinion on the approach.
