| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=871187#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-29 21:00:21 UTC  ``` A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was reported [1] in how plib handles errors when loading 3d model files as X (Direct X), ASC, ASE, ATG, and OFF.  The description of the flaw follows:  Vulnerability Details: Plib is prone to stack based Buffer overflow in the error function in ssg/ssgParser.cxx when it loads 3d model files as X (Direct x), ASC, ASE, ATG, and OFF, if a very long error message is passed to the function, in line 68:   // Output an error void _ssgParser::error( const char *format, ... ) {   char msgbuff[ 255 ];   va_list argp;    char* msgptr = msgbuff;   if (linenum)   {     msgptr += sprintf ( msgptr,"%s, line %d: ",       path, linenum );   }    va_start( argp, format ); 68        vsprintf( msgptr, format, argp );   va_end( argp );    ulSetError ( UL_WARNING, "%s", msgbuff ) ; }  I'm unsure whether or not this was reported upstream (there is no relevant bugs, and the last commit to ssgParser.cxx [2] was five years ago).  [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/10/29/8> [2] <http://plib.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/plib/trunk/src/ssg/ssgParser.cxx?view=log>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=871187#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-29 21:01:27 UTC  ``` Created plib tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 871188](show_bug.cgi?id=871188 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-4552 plib: stack-based buffer overflow in the error function in ssg/ssgParser.cxx [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=871187#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-31 18:31:01 UTC  ``` plib is no longer being maintained upstream:  <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=28580157>  This likely means we should determine whether or not we want to keep this package in Fedora, or what other upstream projects (like FlightGear) are going to do about this lack of maintenance.  Unfortunately this means we will need to come up with our own patch to fix this flaw.   ``` |  |
