Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `error` function within `ssg/ssgParser.cxx` of the PLIB library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-Based Buffer Overflow:** The `error` function uses a fixed-size buffer (`msgbuff` of 255 bytes) to store an error message. The `vsprintf` function is used to format the error message into `msgbuff` without proper bounds checking. If the formatted message is larger than 255 bytes, it will overflow the buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** A successful exploit could overwrite data on the stack, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Denial of Service:** The overflow could cause a crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious 3D Model Files:** The vulnerability can be triggered by loading specially crafted 3D model files (X, ASC, ASE, ATG, and OFF formats) that include excessively long error messages during parsing. The parsing process will pass the overly large error message to the vulnerable `error` function, leading to the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a crafted file:**  An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious 3D model file to be processed by the vulnerable application that is using the PLIB library.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerable code section is located at line 68 in `ssg/ssgParser.cxx`.
*   The `error` function constructs the error message by using `sprintf` to add file and line number and then `vsprintf` to add the provided formatted error message.
*   The `vsprintf` function does not check the length of the output against the `msgbuff` buffer leading to the overflow.
*   The vulnerability affects PLIB version 1.8.5.
*   The upstream project for PLIB is no longer maintained, requiring distros to create their own patches.
*   Patches were released by openSUSE and Red Hat to fix this vulnerability.
