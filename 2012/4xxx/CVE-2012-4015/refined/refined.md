Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a vulnerability in the management screen of myLittleAdmin for SQL Server 2000 that allows for arbitrary script execution. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or encode database entries before displaying them in the management screen.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability is classified as a CWE-79, indicating a cross-site scripting issue. The application fails to prevent the injection of malicious scripts through database entries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution: When a user accesses a malicious database entry through the myLittleAdmin management screen, an attacker-controlled script can be executed in the user's web browser.
- The impact is categorized as partial integrity impact, meaning that an attacker could potentially modify data or change settings. There is no direct confidentiality impact and availability impact listed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious script content into a database entry.
- The malicious script will be executed when a user views the modified database entry through the vulnerable management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to insert or modify database entries with malicious script content.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, however, a malicious database entry must exist that contains the malicious scripts.
- The attack complexity is considered high because it requires an attacker to inject malicious content into the database.
