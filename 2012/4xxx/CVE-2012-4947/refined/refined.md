Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application stores sensitive information, specifically database connection details including clear text credentials, in a file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312):**  Database connection information is stored in a file in plain text. This makes it vulnerable to unauthorized access if the file is compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, specifically database credentials, which can be leveraged to further compromise the system or other systems using the same credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Access:** A malicious user can exploit vulnerabilities in the application to access the file containing the database credentials or gain access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the file containing the credentials. This could involve exploiting other vulnerabilities, gaining unauthorized file system access through command injection, or some other means of access to the files on the server. This could potentially be achieved through a variety of means including those listed under other vulnerabilities (SQLi, file upload etc..) in the same vulnerability note.
