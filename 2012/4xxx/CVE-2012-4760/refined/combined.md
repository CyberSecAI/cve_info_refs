```
Safend Data Protector Multiple Vulnerabilities (Client software) 3.4.5586.9772:

Advisory Link:
<http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/safend-private-key-log-file.html>

Details
CVE number: CVE-2012-4767
The private key data is in the securitylayer.log file in a directory called "logs.9772". This key could potentially be
used to decrypt communications between the client and server and ultimately affect the security policies applied to the
machine.
Impact

An attacker may be able to decrypt and potentially change the Safend security policies applied to the machine.

Advisory Link:
<http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/safend-sdbagent-write-dac-priv-esc.html>

Details
CVE number: CVE-2012-4760
The SDBagent service has 'WRITE_DAC' privileges set for all local users. The WRITE_DAC privilege would allow a local
user to rewrite the acl and give himself full control of the file which could then be trojaned to gain full local admin
privileges. The following is the output from the cacls command:

C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDBAgent.exe BUILTIN\Users:(special access:)

READ_CONTROL
WRITE_DAC
SYNCHRONIZE
FILE_GENERIC_READ
FILE_GENERIC_EXECUTE
FILE_READ_DATA
FILE_READ_EA
FILE_EXECUTE
FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES

NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:F
BUILTIN\Users:R
BUILTIN\Power Users:C
BUILTIN\Administrators:F
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:F

Impact

An attacker may be able to elevate privileges to local administrator level.

Details
CVE number: CVE-2012-4760
The SDPagent service has 'WRITE_DAC' privileges set for all local users. The WRITE_DAC privilege would allow a local
user to rewrite the acl and give himself full control of the file which could then be trojaned to gain full local admin
privileges. The following is the output from the cacls command:

C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDPAgent.exe BUILTIN\Users:(special access:)

READ_CONTROL
WRITE_DAC
SYNCHRONIZE
FILE_GENERIC_READ
FILE_GENERIC_EXECUTE
FILE_READ_DATA
FILE_READ_EA
FILE_EXECUTE
FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES

Impact

An attacker may be able to elevate privileges to local administrator level.

Advisory Link:
<http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/safend-sdbagent-unquoted-path-priv-esc.html>

Details
CVE number: CVE-2012-4761
The SDBAgent Windows service path has spaces in the path and is not quoted:

C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDBAgent.exe

Instead of:
"C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDBAgent.exe"

This could allow a user with write access to the c: drive to create a malicious C:\program.exe file (or even
"c:\program files\safend\data.exe") which would be run in place of the intended file.
Impact

An attacker may be able to elevate privileges to local system level.

Advisory Link:
<http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/safend-sdpagent-unquoted-path-priv-esc.html>

Details
CVE number: CVE-2012-4761
The SDPAgent Windows service path has spaces in the path and is not quoted:

C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDPAgent.exe

Instead of:
"C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDPAgent.exe"

This could allow a user with write access to the c: drive to create a malicious C:\program.exe file (or even
"c:\program files\safend\data.exe") which would be run in place of the intended file.
Impact

An attacker may be able to elevate privileges to local system level.
