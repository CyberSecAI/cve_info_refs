Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2012-4760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `SDBagent.exe` and `SDPAgent.exe` services within Safend Data Protector are configured with insecure access control lists (ACLs). Specifically, the `WRITE_DAC` privilege is granted to all local users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The core issue is the excessive privilege assigned to local users on the service executables.  `WRITE_DAC` grants the ability to modify the file's discretionary access control list (DACL).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability to gain local administrator privileges. By modifying the ACL, they can gain full control over the service executable. They can then replace the legitimate executable with a malicious one, allowing them to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges the next time the service runs.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the machine running the vulnerable Safend Data Protector client software.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to write to the file system in order to replace the original service executable with a malicious one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A standard user account on the targeted Windows system.
*  Ability to write to the file system location where the service executables reside.

**Additional Notes**

*   The content provides more specific details about the vulnerability than a typical CVE description. It includes the affected executable names (`SDBagent.exe` and `SDPAgent.exe`) and specific ACL details extracted using `cacls`.
*   It clearly explains the exploitation process involving manipulating the ACL and replacing the original service executable.
*   The advisory explicitly links the two service vulnerabilities to the same CVE number, CVE-2012-4760.
