Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-4733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a privilege escalation vulnerability in RT versions 4.0.0 and above. It stems from inadequate access control checks on certain ticket modification operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Access Control:** Users with the `ModifyTicket` right could bypass restrictions on the `DeleteTicket` right and custom lifecycle transition rights. This indicates a failure to properly enforce the intended privilege model.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Modification of Ticket Data:** Successful exploitation allows a user with `ModifyTicket` to perform actions they should not be authorized to do, including deleting tickets and possibly performing other unauthorized lifecycle transitions, which can lead to data loss or corruption and potential disruptions of workflows.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves a user with the `ModifyTicket` right attempting to use this right to perform actions that would normally require `DeleteTicket` or custom lifecycle transition rights. The specific method is not detailed but seems to involve using the `ModifyTicket` right in a context or manner not foreseen by the developers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have a valid user account with the `ModifyTicket` right within the RT system. No special network positioning or system level access is required.
