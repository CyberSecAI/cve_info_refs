  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-4555",
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way token processing system of Certificate System processed interrupted token format operations. A local attacker, via suddenly interrupting the token format operation, could use this flaw to cause pki-tps infrastructure to crash with NULL pointer dereference, subsequently leading to relevant Apache httpd web server worker it to need to restart, rendering it to be unavailable for short period of time possibly halting (already) in-progress operations of other users.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Certificate System 8.1",
      "Fedora 16",
      "Fedora 17"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The token processing system of Certificate System does not handle interrupted token format operations correctly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of interrupted operations leading to a NULL pointer dereference."
    ],
     "impact": "A local attacker can cause the pki-tps infrastructure to crash with a NULL pointer dereference, leading to the Apache httpd web server worker process to restart, causing a temporary denial of service. This can interrupt other users' in-progress operations.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local attacker capable of interrupting token format operations."
