Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-4333:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack overflow in the `BackupToAvi` method of certain ActiveX components within the Samsung NET-i ware software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stack overflow vulnerability in ActiveX components.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The stack overflow could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `BackupToAvi` method of specific ActiveX components. This implies that an attacker would likely need to induce a user to visit a malicious webpage, or open a file, that uses these vulnerable ActiveX controls.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to execute code using the vulnerable ActiveX control. This typically involves tricking a user to visit a website or open a file containing the malicious code, and so the attack vector is remote.

**Additional details from the exploit-db entry:**
