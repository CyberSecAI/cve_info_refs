## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

USN-1638-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The new packages introduced

regressions in cookies handling and the User Agent string. This update fixes

the problem.

Original advisory details:

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar

could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this

vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5837](/security/CVE-2012-5837))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar

could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this

vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute

arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or

steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5837](/security/CVE-2012-5837))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830), [CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Managed to get a crash.
Um, few bugs here.
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/base/nsRefreshDriver.cpp?rev=3de1ec1e38cf&mark=431-431#425>
doesn't ensure the viewmanager stays alive.
nsViewManager::ProcessPendingUpdates() is all scary.
CallWillPaintOnObservers(true); flushes, so things which aren't kept explicitly alive
can be dead. And in this case for some reason mRootView is deleted
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/view/src/nsViewManager.cpp?rev=eaccb5bb50c0&mark=1213-1213#1199>
(Could be that the viewmanager itself is dead at that point)

Oh, right, I got the crash when shutting down the browser. So it is the top level
presshell and its viewmanager which are dead.

I strongly suspect it's a regression from [bug 598482](/show_bug.cgi?id=598482 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hook up invalidation flushing to the refresh driver and make all painting asynchronous") which added this code
in RefreshDriver: <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2d5e31af7e3e>
If so, it affects all branches except esr10.Blocks: [598482](/show_bug.cgi?id=598482 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hook up invalidation flushing to the refresh driver and make all painting asynchronous")

Attached patch

[fix](attachment.cgi?id=673110&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=673110&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=802902&attachment=673110)

The fix is the strong ref in RefreshDriver. I added strong refs for
the WillPaintWindow and DidPaintWindow calls as well, just in case.

The fix is very low risk.
We should take this on all branches where it applies.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Use-after-free and buffer overflow issues found using Address Sanitizer

Announced
November 20, 2012
Reporter
Abhishek Arya
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 17
* Firefox ESR 10.0.11
* SeaMonkey 2.14
* Thunderbird 17
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.11

### Description

Security researcher **Abhishek Arya** (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to thank Abhishek for reporting five additional use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow flaws introduced during Firefox development that were fixed before general release.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

Description:
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to the 10.0.11 ESR
security release, which fixes various bugs and security
issues.
\*
MFSA 2012-106: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover a series critically
rated of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and memory
corruption issues in shipped software. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code
execution. We would also like to thank miaubiz for
reporting two additional use-after-free and memory
corruption issues introduced during Firefox development
that have been fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17
and ESR 10.0.11:
o use-after-free when loading html file on osx
(CVE-2012-5830) o Mesa crashes on certain texImage2D calls
involving level>0 (CVE-2012-5833) o integer overflow,
invalid write w/webgl bufferdata (CVE-2012-5835)
The following issues have been fixed in Firefox 17:
o crash in copyTexImage2D with image dimensions
too large for given level (CVE-2012-5838)
\*
MFSA 2012-105: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series critically rated of use-after-free and buffer
overflow issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in shipped
software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting five additional
use-after-free, out of bounds read, and buffer overflow
flaws introduced during Firefox development that have been
fixed before general release.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

\*
MFSA 2012-104 / CVE-2012-4210: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a maliciously crafted
stylesheet is inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and
CSS can run in a chrome privileged context without being
properly sanitized first. This can lead to arbitrary code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-103 / CVE-2012-4209: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location with a
frame whose name attribute's value is set to "top". This
can allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-102 / CVE-2012-5837: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa reported that when script is entered into
the Developer Toolbar, it runs in a chrome privileged
context. This allows for arbitrary code execution or
cross-site scripting (XSS) if a user can be convinced to
paste malicious code into the Developer Toolbar.
\*
MFSA 2012-101 / CVE-2012-4207: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa found when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is
used for text, the "~" character will destroy another
character near the chunk delimiter. This can lead to a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages encoded in
HZ-GB-2312.
\*
MFSA 2012-100 / CVE-2012-5841: Mozilla developer
Bobby Holley reported that security wrappers filter at the
time of property access, but once a function is returned,
the caller can use this function without further security
checks. This affects cross-origin wrappers, allowing for
write actions on objects when only read actions should be
properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-99 / CVE-2012-4208: Mozilla developer Peter
Van der Beken discovered that same-origin XrayWrappers
expose chrome-only properties even when not in a chrome
compartment. This can allow web content to get properties
of DOM objects that are intended to be chrome-only.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-98 / CVE-2012-4206: Security researcher
Robert Kugler reported that when a specifically named DLL
file on a Windows computer is placed in the default
downloads directory with the Firefox installer, the Firefox
installer will load this DLL when it is launched. In
circumstances where the installer is run by an
administrator privileged account, this allows for the
downloaded DLL file to be run with administrator
privileges. This can lead to arbitrary code execution from
a privileged account.
\*
MFSA 2012-97 / CVE-2012-4205: Mozilla developer Gabor
Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created
within sandboxes have the system principal instead of the
sandbox principal. This can lead to cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an add-on running
untrusted code in a sandbox.
\*
MFSA 2012-96 / CVE-2012-4204: Security researcher
Scott Bell of Security-Assessment.com used the Address
Sanitizer tool to discover a memory corruption in
str\_unescape in the Javascript engine. This could
potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
MFSA 2012-95 / CVE-2012-4203: Security researcher
kakzz.ng@gmail.com reported that if a javascript: URL is
selected from the list of Firefox "new tab" page, the
script will inherit the privileges of the privileged "new
tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally
installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a
bookmark of a malicious javascript: URL.
\*
MFSA 2012-94 / CVE-2012-5836: Security researcher
Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining SVG text on a
path with the setting of CSS properties could lead to a
potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-93 / CVE-2012-4201: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that if code executed by
the evalInSandbox function sets location.href, it can get
the wrong subject principal for the URL check, ignoring the
sandbox's Javascript context and gaining the context of
evalInSandbox object. This can lead to malicious web
content being able to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack or stealing a copy of a local file if the user has
installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack.
\*
MFSA 2012-92 / CVE-2012-4202: Security researcher
Atte Kettunen from OUSPG used the Address Sanitizer tool to
discover a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format
images. This issue is potentially exploitable and could
lead to arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-91: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

Sorry for taking so long to get to this -- I was away for the last eight days or so. The test doesn't seem to do anything bad on trunk (as of an hour or two ago), even if I refresh a bunch of times. Can you confirm that this will actually crash a trunk build right now? Or should I be looking for something else? I can't easily tell from the stack traces what's going on, particularly since the line numbers don't seem to match trunk anymore either.

1. It does not reproduce on trunk anymore, but before it used to reproduce easily with just one firefox instance.
2. The crash happens on line <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/editor/libeditor/base/nsEditor.cpp#3319> which i remember was the same line when i filed the bug.
3. You can use builds from <https://people.mozilla.com/~choller/firefox/asan/> to see when it stopped reproducing. it is like 10 days since the bug is filed and i see builds till 9/30 there.

Yeah, let's try to bisect it to see what fixed it, and whether that was expected. This might have been just wallpapered by something else, so we shouldn't necessarily assume that it's fixed unless we know for sure.

I can't use ASAN builds on my desktop because it's 32-bit Linux, and the builds seem to be only 64-bit. I'll try on my laptop. I tried with some nightlies from <<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/>>, and couldn't reproduce on any of them: 2012-09-24-mozilla-central-debug, 2012-09-29-03-06-24-mozilla-central, 2012-09-29-mozilla-central-debug. The stack traces here don't make a lot of sense to me, so I probably need a local reproduction to track it down.

I can reproduce with the ASAN builds, but not with a regular debug nightly of the same night. 20121006-mozilla-central-linux64-debug-2da1f2bde40e+asan does not exhibit the problem, but 20121004-mozilla-central-linux64-debug-4cb8f88213f5+asan does. Linux m-c builds for 2012-10-05 are not available, so that's the smallest range I can get using ASAN builds. So this is the range:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=4cb8f88213f5&tochange=2da1f2bde40e>
Ehsan, what should I do here? I don't see a way to debug the problem without building locally, but it seems like I need to build with ASAN to detect the problem, which looks to be something of an ordeal. I'm not totally sure I can, because my machine is 32 bits with PAE, rather than 64 bits as recommended. Do you think this is a good use of a few hours of my time, or can you think of a better way to approach this?
In particular, is there any way to detect the bug in a non-ASAN build, such as by adding a bit of extra code somewhere? That would make things a lot easier.

Building with ASAN should not be very hard. There's some initial setup in terms of building your own clang, and after that it's mostly a mozconfig change. Have you tried the instructions here? <<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Building_Firefox_with_Address_Sanitizer>> I'm not aware of anything which prevents you from doing 32-bit ASAN builds.
It seems like ASAN builds are the only way we can reproduce this...

It reproduces easily every time on my older windows build (i think 1-2 weeks old). As i was debugging, candidate raw node looks get freed in the IsEditable call and is later used in FindNode.
if (!aEditableNode || IsEditable(candidate)) {
return candidate;
}
return FindNode(candidate, aGoForward, aEditableNode, bNoBlockCrossing);
Specifically, something in this part of the code is freeing it [nsHTMLEditor::IsVisTextNode].
if (aNode->TextIsOnlyWhitespace())
{
nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMNode> node = do\_QueryInterface(aNode);
nsWSRunObject wsRunObj(this, node, 0);
nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMNode> visNode;
int32\_t outVisOffset=0;
WSType visType;
wsRunObj.NextVisibleNode(node, 0, address\_of(visNode),
&outVisOffset, &visType);
if (visType == WSType::normalWS || visType == WSType::text) {
\*outIsEmptyNode = (node != visNode);
}
}

Put a alert(1) in the event handler and see it getting fired here
if (content && content->IsElement()) {
elementStyle = nsComputedDOMStyle::GetStyleContextForElement(content->AsElement(),
nullptr,
ps);
That event handler blows away the nodes.

if (aNode->TextIsOnlyWhitespace())
{
nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMNode> node = do\_QueryInterface(aNode);
........
}
since node maintains the ref, as soon as the if ends, you will see aNode (raw pointer) going stale.

Now I started getting consistent segfaults in my regular debug builds on this test-case. Well, okay. Stepping through, I find that going into IsVisTextNode, aNode has a refcount of 1. After the nsWSRunObject constructor, it goes up to 7. It stays there until the end of the block, and after the end of the block the node is killed. So the nsWSRunObject destructor is Release()ing more times than the constructor is AddRef()ing. Now I'll just step through and see why that's happening.

So the basic bug seems to still exist in trunk -- the destructor still releases more times than the constructor addrefs. I printed out refcounts at various points using List():

So at the end, the refcount is still one lower than at the start. It just happens that this makes it go from 4 to 3 instead of from 1 to 0, so a use-after-free is averted in this specific case, but something is still very wrong here!
The problem is, I'm not clear how this could be happening. I'll try setting conditional breakpoints on AddRef() and Release() and see if I can puzzle it out.

Okay, so after a good hour or so of painstakingly stepping through every AddRef() and Release(), here's the issue. The constructor for nsWSRunObject calls nsWSRunObject::GetRuns. This wants to figure out how to break up the whitespace, so it calls nsEditor::IsPreformatted. This needs style info, so it calls nsComputedDOMStyle::GetStyleContextForElement. This then calls PresShell::FlushPendingNotifications, which eventually winds up calling JS. The JS modifies the DOM.
So basically, calling IsEditable() can wind up running script, which can Release(). Thus anything that calls IsEditable() must make sure it has strong references to anything it plans to refer to later on. It so happens that something randomly changed in trunk that meant that in this case the refcount wound up being nonzero anyway, but we can't depend on that.
It goes back to nsEditor::FindNode doing
nsIContent\* candidate =
FindNextLeafNode(aCurrentNode, aGoForward, bNoBlockCrossing);
and then passing candidate to a function after calling IsEditable(candidate). Since it doesn't keep a reference, it blows up. This is due to [bug 635618](/show_bug.cgi?id=635618 "RESOLVED FIXED - Typing goes incredibly slow in a contentEditable div when there are a lot of divs") -- it rewrote the function to use nsINode\*, and changed nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMNode> candidate to nsIContent\* candidate in the process. Boris was probably making silly assumptions like "IsEditable() will not mutate the DOM". This is why I always use nsCOMPtr even if it looks like it shouldn't be necessary -- who knows what crazy stuff can happen further down on the stack?
I'll make this use nsCOMPtr, and look for any other patches from that bug that also might have taken away nsCOMPtr.Blocks: [635618](/show_bug.cgi?id=635618 "RESOLVED FIXED - Typing goes incredibly slow in a contentEditable div when there are a lot of divs")

Attached patch

[Patch](attachment.cgi?id=670328&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=670328&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=795708&attachment=670328)

[Bug 635618](/show_bug.cgi?id=635618 "RESOLVED FIXED - Typing goes incredibly slow in a contentEditable div when there are a lot of divs") removed nsCOMPtr use in a whole bunch more places than this. I don't \*think\* any of them would be a problem right now, but it still makes me nervous, because someone could change any of the relevant code at any time and not realize they're introducing a use-after-free. Would you like a patch to change them all to use nsCOMPtr instead of raw pointers? I somehow don't think any of this is performance-critical.

Yes please! And thanks for the extensive analysis.
Note that [bug 796839](/show_bug.cgi?id=796839 "VERIFIED FIXED - CK Editor video adding option on vB 4.2 not working since FF15") recently touched the code around there, so that may describe some behavior differences between trunk/aurora and older branches.

Patch
[Security approval request comment]
How easily can the security issue be deduced from the patch? fairly easily. This sort of screams refcounting bug.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem? no.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw? all except ESR.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw? [bug 635618](/show_bug.cgi?id=635618 "RESOLVED FIXED - Typing goes incredibly slow in a contentEditable div when there are a lot of divs").
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be? they're the same.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need? not likely at all.

I searched using the following regex:
find editor/ -name '\*.cpp' -exec grep '^ \+nsI[a-zA-Z\_]\+ \?\\*.\*=' {} +
This will find anything that looks like "nsIFoo\*" or "nsIFoo \*" at the start of the line, if there's an = anywhere later on the line. Crude, but it largely works. I found a lot of things that matched it, and fixed all of them, skipping nsIFrame and nsITransaction. (Later I undid changes to nsITableCellLayout too.) I used the following command to fix:
find editor/ -name '\*.cpp' -exec sed -i 's/^\( \+\)nsI\(Atom\|BidiKeyboard\|Content\|DocShell\|Document\|DOMElement\|DOMNode\|FocusManager\|LoadContext\|Node\|ParserService\|PresShell\|Principal\|TableCellLayout\|TransactionListener\|URI\|WordBreaker\)\(\\* \| \\*\)\(.\*=\)/\1nsCOMPtr<nsI\2> \4/g' {} +
Then I had to manually fix up places that were now invalid static\_casts, one case with "nsIDOMNode \*a, \*b =" that became "nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMNode> a, \*b", etc. A lot of these places are obviously okay if manually inspected and don't actually need changing, but it would be a lot of error-prone work to figure out which are which. There were around 160 total places changed.
But this caused problems, like
###!!! ASSERTION: Changing refcount of nsDocument object during Traverse is not permitted!: 'Error', file /mnt/ssd/checkouts/central/content/base/src/nsDocument.cpp, line 1713
So it doesn't seem to be a good idea to change \*everything\* like this. Do you have any suggestions as to how I could narrow it down?

Hmm, not besides doing the stuff in the sed command one by one... :/

I'll assume that around that time someone will grant the sec-approval flag, at which point we'll remember about landing this patch. :-)

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [ubufox](/security/cves?package=ubufox) - Ubuntu Firefox specific configuration defaults and apt support

## Details

USN-1638-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides an

updated ubufox package for use with the latest Firefox.

Original advisory details:

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed

Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and

Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting

Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an

attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via

application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5842](/security/CVE-2012-5842), [CVE-2012-5843](/security/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format

images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code

as the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-4202](/security/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function's JavaScript sandbox

context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the

user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site

scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially

crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents,

or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](/security/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting

of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text

could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](/security/CVE-2012-5836))

It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of

Firefox "new tab" page, the script will inherit the privileges of the

privileged "new tab" page. This allows for the execution of locally

installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a

malicious javascript: URL. ([CVE-2012-4203](/security/CVE-2012-4203))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine.

If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of

another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4204](/security/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within

sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This

can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an

add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](/security/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does

not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could

use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object

properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](/security/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write

actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly

allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a

specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the

contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain.

([CVE-2012-5841](/security/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used

for text, the "~" character will destroy another character near the chunk

delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages

encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user

were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could

exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within

the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](/security/CVE-2012-4207))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by

binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute's

value is set to "top". This can allow for possible cross-site scripting

(XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,

if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote

attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](/security/CVE-2012-4209))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is

inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome

privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4210](/security/CVE-2012-4210))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues

in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-4214](/security/CVE-2012-4214), [CVE-2012-4215](/security/CVE-2012-4215), [CVE-2012-4216](/security/CVE-2012-4216), [CVE-2012-5829](/security/CVE-2012-5829),

[CVE-2012-5839](/security/CVE-2012-5839), [CVE-2012-5840](/security/CVE-2012-5840), [CVE-2012-4212](/security/CVE-2012-4212), [CVE-2012-4213](/security/CVE-2012-4213), [CVE-2012-4217](/security/CVE-2012-4217),

[CVE-2012-4218](/security/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5830](/security/CVE-2012-5830),

[CVE-2012-5833](/security/CVE-2012-5833), [CVE-2012-5835](/security/CVE-2012-5835), [CVE-2012-5838](/security/CVE-2012-5838))
