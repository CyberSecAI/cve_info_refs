  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-4556",
    "description": "A temporary denial of service flaw was found in the way token processing system of Certificate System processed user certificate search queries with certain empty search fields. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the main Apache httpd web server broker it to need to restart (resulting into situation where the client would obtain connection reset instead of proper error message), leading to (temporary) denial of service (resulting into any users currently in the middle of enrolling tokens to experience a connection drop and their in progress operation to be terminated).",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Certificate System 8"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way the token processing system of the Certificate System handles user certificate search queries with specific empty search fields, leading to a denial-of-service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Denial of service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause the Apache httpd web server process to crash and restart, resulting in a temporary denial of service. Users in the middle of enrolling tokens may experience a connection drop.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specific certificate search query with certain empty fields."
