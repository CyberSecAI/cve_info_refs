  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The fix for CVE-2009-4030 was removed from MySQL packages in RHSA-2012:0127 when it was updated to version 5.0.95. Upstream claimed to have corrected this in version 5.0.88, so the patch was removed when it did not apply.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The fix for CVE-2009-4030, which addressed a flaw in how MySQL checked paths for DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives when 'datadir' was a relative path, was unintentionally removed."
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker could bypass the restriction preventing the use of subdirectories of the MySQL data directory as DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY paths.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker needs to be authenticated to the MySQL server.",
      "The attacker needs to be able to control the paths used as arguments for the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the MySQL server. They need to be able to set the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives in the MySQL configuration or through command-line arguments.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is only exploitable when the `datadir` option is configured with a relative path. If the `basedir` and `datadir` directives are unchanged, or if `symbolic-links=0` is set in the `my.cnf` configuration file, the vulnerability is not exploitable."
