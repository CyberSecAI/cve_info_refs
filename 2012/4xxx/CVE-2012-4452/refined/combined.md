| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=860808#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-26 18:38:56 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2009-4030](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4030) was removed from the MySQL packages as provided with RHSA-2012:0127 when it was updated to version 5.0.95.  Upstream claimed to have corrected this in version 5.0.88, so the patch was removed when it did not apply.  As a result, MySQL version 5.0.95-1.el5_7.1 became vulnerable to [CVE-2009-4030](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4030) again.  For most default or typical configurations, this flaw has no impact.  Please see [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=543653#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=543653#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-4030 mysql: Incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2079 / CVE-2008-4098") for further discussion on the possible scenarios where this flaw can be triggered.  If the basedir and datadir directives are unchanged in MySQL's configuration or command-line arguments, this flaw has no impact.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=860808#c2)  Huzaifa S.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

Updated mysql packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

It was found that the fix for the CVE-2009-4030 issue, a flaw in the way
MySQL checked the paths used as arguments for the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX
DIRECTORY directives when the "datadir" option was configured with a
relative path, was incorrectly removed when the mysql packages in Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 were updated to version 5.0.95 via RHSA-2012:0127. An
authenticated attacker could use this flaw to bypass the restriction
preventing the use of subdirectories of the MySQL data directory being used
as DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY paths. This update re-applies the fix
for CVE-2009-4030. (CVE-2012-4452)

Note: If the use of the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives were
disabled as described in RHSA-2010:0109 (by adding "symbolic-links=0" to
the "[mysqld]" section of the "my.cnf" configuration file), users were not
vulnerable to this issue.

This issue was discovered by Karel Volny of the Red Hat Quality Engineering
team.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the log file path in the logrotate script did not

behave as expected. As a consequence, the logrotate function failed to
rotate the "/var/log/mysqld.log" file. This update modifies the logrotate
script to allow rotating the mysqld.log file. (BZ#647223)

* Prior to this update, the mysqld daemon could fail when using the EXPLAIN

flag in prepared statement mode. This update modifies the underlying code
to handle the EXPLAIN flag as expected. (BZ#654000)

* Prior to this update, the mysqld init script could wrongly report that

mysql server startup failed when the server was actually started. This
update modifies the init script to report the status of the mysqld server
as expected. (BZ#703476)

* Prior to this update, the "--enable-profiling" option was by default

disabled. This update enables the profiling feature. (BZ#806365)

All MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this
update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=860808#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-26 18:38:56 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2009-4030](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4030) was removed from the MySQL packages as provided with RHSA-2012:0127 when it was updated to version 5.0.95.  Upstream claimed to have corrected this in version 5.0.88, so the patch was removed when it did not apply.  As a result, MySQL version 5.0.95-1.el5_7.1 became vulnerable to [CVE-2009-4030](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4030) again.  For most default or typical configurations, this flaw has no impact.  Please see [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=543653#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=543653#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-4030 mysql: Incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2079 / CVE-2008-4098") for further discussion on the possible scenarios where this flaw can be triggered.  If the basedir and datadir directives are unchanged in MySQL's configuration or command-line arguments, this flaw has no impact.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=860808#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-09-27 06:06:53 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=860808#c5)  Murray McAllister    2012-11-15 01:37:35 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Karel Volný of the Red Hat Quality Engineering team.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=860808#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-08 04:54:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:0121 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0121.html>   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0127)

## Topic

Updated mysql packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the MySQL database server.
Information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Critical Patch
Update Advisory page, listed in the References section. (CVE-2012-0075,
CVE-2012-0087, CVE-2012-0101, CVE-2012-0102, CVE-2012-0114, CVE-2012-0484,
CVE-2012-0490)

These updated packages upgrade MySQL to version 5.0.95. Refer to the MySQL
release notes for a full list of changes:

<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/news-5-0-x.html>

All MySQL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing this update, the MySQL server daemon
(mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=860808#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-26 18:38:56 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2009-4030](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4030) was removed from the MySQL packages as provided with RHSA-2012:0127 when it was updated to version 5.0.95.  Upstream claimed to have corrected this in version 5.0.88, so the patch was removed when it did not apply.  As a result, MySQL version 5.0.95-1.el5_7.1 became vulnerable to [CVE-2009-4030](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4030) again.  For most default or typical configurations, this flaw has no impact.  Please see [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=543653#c4](show_bug.cgi?id=543653#c4 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-4030 mysql: Incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2079 / CVE-2008-4098") for further discussion on the possible scenarios where this flaw can be triggered.  If the basedir and datadir directives are unchanged in MySQL's configuration or command-line arguments, this flaw has no impact.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=860808#c2)  Huzaifa S.

Subject: CVE-2009-4030 regression in mysql

Hi All,

It was found that the fix for CVE-2009-4030 was not present in mysql
version 5.0.88, as claimed by upstream.

As a result of this, Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2012:0127 which
rebased mysql in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to 5.0.95, missed the above
fix.

We have assigned CVE-2012-4452 to this issue.

Reference:

## Topic

Updated mysql packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

MySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. It consists of
the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) and many client programs and libraries.

It was discovered that the MySQL client ignored certain SSL certificate
verification errors when connecting to servers. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could use this flaw to trick MySQL clients into connecting to a
spoofed MySQL server. (CVE-2009-4028)

Note: This fix may uncover previously hidden SSL configuration issues, such
as incorrect CA certificates being used by clients or expired server
certificates. This update should be carefully tested in deployments where
SSL connections are used.

A flaw was found in the way MySQL handled SELECT statements with subqueries
in the WHERE clause, that assigned results to a user variable. A remote,
authenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash the MySQL server daemon
(mysqld). This issue only caused a temporary denial of service, as the
MySQL daemon was automatically restarted after the crash. (CVE-2009-4019)

When the "datadir" option was configured with a relative path, MySQL did
not properly check paths used as arguments for the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX
DIRECTORY directives. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to
bypass the restriction preventing the use of subdirectories of the MySQL
data directory being used as DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY paths.
(CVE-2009-4030)

Note: Due to the security risks and previous security issues related to the
use of the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY directives, users not
depending on this feature should consider disabling it by adding
"symbolic-links=0" to the "[mysqld]" section of the "my.cnf" configuration
file. In this update, an example of such a configuration was added to the
default "my.cnf" file.

All MySQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this
update, the MySQL server daemon (mysqld) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>
