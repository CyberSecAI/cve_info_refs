Safend Data Protector Multiple Vulnerabilities (Client software) 3.4.5586.9772:

Advisory Link:
<http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/safend-sdbagent-unquoted-path-priv-esc.html>

Details
CVE number: CVE-2012-4761
The SDBAgent Windows service path has spaces in the path and is not quoted:

C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDBAgent.exe

Instead of:
"C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDBAgent.exe"

This could allow a user with write access to the c: drive to create a malicious C:\program.exe file (or even
"c:\program files\safend\data.exe") which would be run in place of the intended file.
Impact

An attacker may be able to elevate privileges to local system level.

Details
CVE number: CVE-2012-4761
The SDPAgent Windows service path has spaces in the path and is not quoted:

C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDPAgent.exe

Instead of:
"C:\Program Files\Safend\Data Protection Agent\SDPAgent.exe"

This could allow a user with write access to the c: drive to create a malicious C:\program.exe file (or even
"c:\program files\safend\data.exe") which would be run in place of the intended file.
Impact

An attacker may be able to elevate privileges to local system level.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SDBAgent and SDPAgent Windows services have unquoted paths with spaces in their service path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unquoted service paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve local system privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user with write access to the root of the C drive can place a malicious executable at a location within the unquoted path to be executed by the service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local user with write access to the C drive.
