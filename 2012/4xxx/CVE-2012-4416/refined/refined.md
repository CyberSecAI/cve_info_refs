  "CVE-2012-4416": {
    "description": "An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation of Oracle Java SE 7 used to initialize integer arrays (they have had nonzero elements right after the allocation in certain circumstances). An attacker could use this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "A bug in the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine optimization code caused it to not perform array initialization in certain cases, leading to uninitialized memory being exposed.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could use this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from the JVM's memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting a vulnerability in the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute a Java application or applet that exploits the vulnerability.",
