Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-4737:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from the fact that Asterisk does not properly apply Access Control List (ACL) rules when an IAX2 call is made using the credentials of a peer defined in a dynamic Asterisk Realtime Architecture (ARA) backend.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **ACL bypass:** The core weakness is the failure to enforce ACL rules for IAX2 peers defined in an ARA backend. This allows a user to bypass intended restrictions on call origination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Use of System:** An attacker with knowledge of a peer's credentials can bypass the configured ACL rules for that peer. This allows them to place outbound calls which they would otherwise be restricted from.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely.
*   **IAX2 Protocol:** The vulnerability is specific to IAX2 calls.
*   **ARA Backend:** The attack requires that the peer be defined in a dynamic ARA backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker must know the credentials (username/password) of an IAX2 peer that is defined within an ARA backend.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Asterisk server using the IAX2 protocol.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
*   The issue affects multiple versions of Asterisk, including both open-source and commercial editions.
*   Patches and corrected versions are available to address this vulnerability.
