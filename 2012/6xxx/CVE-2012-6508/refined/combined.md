How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the Car Portal v3.0 web application.
Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2012-04-24: Public or Non-Public Disclosure
Discovery Status:
=================
Published
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote
Severity Level:
===============
Medium
Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the car portal v3.0 web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application-side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Post a new vehicle - PWRS & Description field
[+] Create News - News title
[+] Create a sub user - Name
[+] Create new user group - group Name
[+] Change profile - Dealer name &First Name & Last Name
1.2
Multiple cross site request forgery vulnerabilities are detected in the car portal v3.0 web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to enforce the user (admin) to change user`s password, Create a user, sub user, or change profile information
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to creating a new admin account or changing user`s password.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] cars/ADMIN/index.php?category=security&action=nouveau
[+] USERS/index.php?category=profile&action=edit
[+] USERS/index.php?category=home&action=sub\_accounts
1.3
Arbitrary file upload allows the attacker to upload files that differs than images. The attacker can upload the file by
changing its name from file.php to file.php%00.php. After the uploading the file .jpg of the file will be truncated and the
file will save on the sever as file.php.
Successful exploitation can result in malware or malicious web shell upload which results in a system comrpomise at the end.
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with required low & high required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...
1.1
The issue can be exploited by creating news, new sub user, or new group with script code as value.
The result is the persistent execution out of the web application context.
Strings: >"<3 ... or >"

1.3
The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading the file with name
file.php%00.jpg instead of file.php
Security Risk:
==============
1.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).
1.2
The security risk of the cross site request forgery vulnerability is estimated as low.
1.3
The security risk of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).
