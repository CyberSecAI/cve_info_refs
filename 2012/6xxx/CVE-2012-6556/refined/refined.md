```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input sanitization in the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields within the Vanilla FirstLastNames plugin.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which executes when other users view the profile page of the compromised user. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website for other users.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through the user profile edit page where the first and last name fields are vulnerable.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to have an account on the affected forum and the ability to edit their own profile to inject the malicious payload.
