- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the vulnerability allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary shell commands using the device management command-line interface (CLI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution, potentially leading to total compromise of the device. This includes full control over the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and data.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device's management CLI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated administrator of the device.
