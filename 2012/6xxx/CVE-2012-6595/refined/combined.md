### Description

A vulnerability exists whereby an authenticated user can inject arbitrary shell commands using the device management command line interface. (Ref #34595)

This vulnerability can result in arbitrary command execution, and can result in total compromise of the device. The attacker must still be an authenticated administrator of the device.

This issue affects PAN-OS 4.1.1 and earlier; PAN-OS 4.0.8 and earlier; PAN-OS 3.0.x is not affected.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 4.1 | <= 4.1.1 | >= 4.1.2 |
| PAN-OS 4.0 | <= 4.0.8 | >= 4.0.9 |

### Severity: HIGH, Suggested Urgency: N/A

CVSS-B:
8.4 ([CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78")

### Solution

PAN-OS 4.1.2 and later. PAN-OS 4.0.9 and later.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

This issue affects the management interface of the device. Security appliance management best practices dictate that the management interface be isolated and strictly limited only to security administration personnel.
