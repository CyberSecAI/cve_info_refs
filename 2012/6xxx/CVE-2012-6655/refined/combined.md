| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=892382#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-08-18 16:20:02 UTC  ``` Via bugs.freedesktop.org:  Calling SetPassword() on the AccountsService results in a crypted password included on the command line. This seems to me to be minor security hole. It is the equivalent of having /etc/shadow readable by non-root users (albeit only for those who change their password via the AccountsService).  Any other local user can (in a default linux configuration) see the command lines of any other process on the system.  The relevant code is in src/user.c in the user_change_password_authorized_cb() function:          argv[0] = "/usr/sbin/usermod";         argv[1] = "-p";         argv[2] = strings[0];         argv[3] = "--";         argv[4] = user->user_name;         argv[5] = NULL;  strings[0] has been set to the crypted password in user_set_password(). The crypted password has been passed from the client (ie: gnome-control-center).  CVE-2012-6655 was assigned to this issue.

(+SLE-12) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=892382#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-08-18 22:00:26 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=892382#c4)  Dominique Leuenberger   2016-08-05 07:34:30 UTC  ``` Passing on to Frederic - maybe you find somebody to actually dig into this (it's likely still an issue in SLE12?!) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=892382#c5)  Felix Zhang   2017-07-25 03:58:29 UTC  ``` The bug is not fixed by upstream yet. So probably still an issue in TW too.. ``` |  |

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-08-17 18:09:50 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  It was reported that accountsservice invokes usermod with the -p parameter when calling SetPassword(), which can leak encrypted  passwords locally (being that they are briefly visible via ps).  As noted in the upstream bug:  The relevant code is in src/user.c in the user_change_password_authorized_cb() function:          argv[0] = "/usr/sbin/usermod";         argv[1] = "-p";         argv[2] = strings[0];         argv[3] = "--";         argv[4] = user->user_name;         argv[5] = NULL;  strings[0] has been set to the crypted password in user_set_password(). The crypted password has been passed from the client (ie:  gnome-control-center).  This has not yet been corrected upstream.  References:  <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55000> <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=757912> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1130538>    @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Christopher Díaz Riveros (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2017-07-06 17:53:40 UTC  ```  From:   <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1130538> <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6655>  The bug was labeled closed wontfix ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1130538#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-08-15 13:41:59 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that accountsservice invokes usermod with the -p parameter when calling SetPassword(), which can leak encrypted passwords locally (being that they are briefly visible via ps).  As noted in the upstream bug:  The relevant code is in src/user.c in the user_change_password_authorized_cb() function:          argv[0] = "/usr/sbin/usermod";         argv[1] = "-p";         argv[2] = strings[0];         argv[3] = "--";         argv[4] = user->user_name;         argv[5] = NULL;  strings[0] has been set to the crypted password in user_set_password(). The crypted password has been passed from the client (ie: gnome-control-center).  This has not yet been corrected upstream.   [1] <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55000>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1130538#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-08-15 13:46:57 UTC  ```  Created accountsservice tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1130543](show_bug.cgi?id=1130543 "CLOSED EOL - accountsservice: local encrypted password disclosure when changing password [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1130538#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-08-16 17:41:24 UTC  ``` This was assigned CVE-2012-6655:  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/08/16/7>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1130538#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-08-15 13:41:59 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that accountsservice invokes usermod with the -p parameter when calling SetPassword(), which can leak encrypted passwords locally (being that they are briefly visible via ps).  As noted in the upstream bug:  The relevant code is in src/user.c in the user_change_password_authorized_cb() function:          argv[0] = "/usr/sbin/usermod";         argv[1] = "-p";         argv[2] = strings[0];         argv[3] = "--";         argv[4] = user->user_name;         argv[5] = NULL;  strings[0] has been set to the crypted password in user_set_password(). The crypted password has been passed from the client (ie: gnome-control-center).  This has not yet been corrected upstream.   [1] <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55000>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1130538#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-08-15 13:46:57 UTC  ```  Created accountsservice tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1130543](show_bug.cgi?id=1130543 "CLOSED EOL - accountsservice: local encrypted password disclosure when changing password [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1130538#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-08-16 17:41:24 UTC  ``` This was assigned CVE-2012-6655:  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/08/16/7>   ``` |  |

Subject: accountsservice: passes (encrypted) passwords as commandline arguments
Date: Tue, 12 Aug 2014 12:06:03 +0200
```
Package: accountsservice
Version: 0.6.37-3
Severity: normal
Tags: security

Hi,

accountsservice passes (encrypted) passwords as command line arguments
to usermod:

+---
|         argv[0] = "/usr/sbin/usermod";
|         argv[1] = "-p";
|         argv[2] = strings[0];
+---[ src/user.c ]

Command line arguments, and thus the (encrypted) password, are by
default readable by every local user.

Please use some other means to set passwords that do not involve
passing them as command line arguments, for example by using chpasswd
which allows passing user name and password via stdin.

Ansgar

```

I sent a fix upstream (using chpasswd -e instead) in
<https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/accountsservice/accountsservice/-/merge_requests/118>
and backported it into the Debian package in:

accountsservice (22.08.8-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload
  * d/control: accountsservice Recommends polkitd.
    Without polkitd, its D-Bus interface will be essentially read-only.
  * d/tests/integration.py: Add an integration test.
    Among other things, this exercises #1030253 and #1030262, and detected
    the missing Recommends on polkitd.
  * d/p/user-Replace-usermod-p-with-chpasswd-e.patch:
    Add patch to avoid (encrypted) password being briefly visible in /proc
    (Closes: #757912; [CVE-2012-6655](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6655))
    - d/tests/integration.py: Assert that [CVE-2012-6655](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6655) was avoided
  * d/copyright: Fix a typo detected by Lintian
  * Standards-Version: 4.6.2 (no changes required)

 -- Simon McVittie <smcv@debian.org>  Sun, 05 Feb 2023 19:07:46 +0000

That version never actually reached unstable (I uploaded 22.08.8-4 instead)
so the bug wasn't automatically closed. Closing it now.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=55000#c0)  Stef Walter    2012-09-17 08:59:16 UTC  ``` Calling SetPassword() on the AccountsService results in a crypted password included on the command line. This seems to me to be minor security hole. It is the equivalent of having /etc/shadow readable by non-root users (albeit only for those who change their password via the AccountsService).  Any other local user can (in a default linux configuration) see the command lines of any other process on the system.  The relevant code is in src/user.c in the user_change_password_authorized_cb() function:          argv[0] = "/usr/sbin/usermod";         argv[1] = "-p";         argv[2] = strings[0];         argv[3] = "--";         argv[4] = user->user_name;         argv[5] = NULL;  strings[0] has been set to the crypted password in user_set_password(). The crypted password has been passed from the client (ie: gnome-control-center). ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=55000#c1)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2012-09-17 15:59:04 UTC  ``` ugghh ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=55000#c2)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2012-09-17 16:01:36 UTC  ``` we should probably just drop this and get [attachment 63941](attachment.cgi?id=63941 "Use PAM to change passwords") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=63941&action=edit "Use PAM to change passwords") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=55000&attachment=63941) (from [bug 51833](show_bug.cgi?id=51833 "RESOLVED MOVED - PIN login infrastructure")) in (with changes to make sure we don't repeat the same mistake) ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=55000#c3)  Chris Wilson    2013-02-05 11:41:43 UTC  ``` Hmm, right, that would not be along the spans path in the first place. Oh well, I can try one of the other workarounds I had earlier... ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=55000#c4)  Chris Wilson    2013-02-05 11:42:17 UTC  ``` Oops, wrong bug report, sorry. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=55000#c5)  Chris Wilson    2013-06-22 20:07:41 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 66055](show_bug.cgi?id=66055 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - [gen4, sna] Corruption when scrolling in transparent urxvt") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=55000#c6)  Laurent Bigonville    2016-05-08 13:52:03 UTC  ``` Apparently this is CVE-2012-6655 ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=55000#c7)  GitLab Migration User    2018-08-07 09:30:19 UTC  ``` -- GitLab Migration Automatic Message --  This bug has been migrated to freedesktop.org's GitLab instance and has been closed from further activity.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
