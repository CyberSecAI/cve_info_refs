Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a double-free caused by an incorrect placement of the `free()` call in the `dhcp.c` file, within the `parse_dhcpmessage()` function when handling the `DHCP_DNSSEARCH` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Double-Free:** The code frees the `dhcp->dnssearch` memory before calling the `decode_search` function to determine the length, and then frees it again after reallocating memory, leading to a double-free.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** The double-free can lead to a crash of the `dhcpcd` process, causing a denial of service.
- **Memory Corruption:** Double-frees can corrupt the heap, potentially leading to further issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious DHCP Server:** An attacker can craft a malicious DHCP server that sends a specially crafted DHCP message to a client using dhcpcd with the `DHCP_DNSSEARCH` option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious DHCP response to the victim's DHCP client, therefore being in a position to intercept or act as a DHCP server.

**Additional Details:**

- The `decode_search()` function is used to parse DNS search options within the DHCP message.
- The vulnerability exists in `dhcpcd` versions prior to the fix.
- This vulnerability is related to other vulnerabilities reported by Guido Vranken in the same component (`CVE-2012-6698`, `CVE-2012-6699`).
- The provided patch from the launchpad bug report fixes this vulnerability by moving the `free` call after the length calculation.
