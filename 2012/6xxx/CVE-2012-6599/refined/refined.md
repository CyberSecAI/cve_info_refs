Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-6599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when processing device management commands via the command-line interface (CLI). This allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary operating system commands through a vulnerable interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute any command on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
- **Total Compromise of Device:** This can lead to complete control over the device, potentially including data exfiltration, denial of service, and further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the device's local management interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the affected device to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Access to Management Interface:**  The attacker needs access to the command-line interface of the device.

**Affected Versions:**
- PAN-OS 4.1.0 and earlier
- PAN-OS 4.0.7 and earlier
- PAN-OS 3.0.x is not affected

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to PAN-OS 4.1.1 or later for the 4.1 branch.
- Upgrade to PAN-OS 4.0.8 or later for the 4.0 branch.
- Restrict management interface access to security administration personnel.
