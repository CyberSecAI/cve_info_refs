Discovery Status:
=================
Published
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote
Severity Level:
===============
Medium
Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the car portal v3.0 web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application-side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Post a new vehicle - PWRS & Description field
[+] Create News - News title
[+] Create a sub user - Name
[+] Create new user group - group Name
[+] Change profile - Dealer name &First Name & Last Name
1.2
Multiple cross site request forgery vulnerabilities are detected in the car portal v3.0 web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to enforce the user (admin) to change user`s password, Create a user, sub user, or change profile information

file will save on the sever as file.php.
Successful exploitation can result in malware or malicious web shell upload which results in a system comrpomise at the end.
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with required low & high required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...
1.1
The issue can be exploited by creating news, new sub user, or new group with script code as value.
The result is the persistent execution out of the web application context.
Strings: >"<3 ... or >"

1.3
The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading the file with name
file.php%00.jpg instead of file.php
Security Risk:
==============
1.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).
1.2
The security risk of the cross site request forgery vulnerability is estimated as low.
1.3
