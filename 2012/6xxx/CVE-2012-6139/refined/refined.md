Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-6139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how libxslt handles certain empty values within XSLT stylesheets, specifically:

1.  **Empty `match` attribute in `xsl:key`:** When an `xsl:key` element has an empty `match` attribute, a null pointer dereference occurs in the `xsltAddKey` function within `keys.c`.
2.  **Uninitialized variable in `document()` function:** Passing an uninitialized variable as a parameter to the `document()` function leads to a null pointer dereference in the `xsltDocumentFunction` function within `functions.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference, which occurs when the code attempts to access a memory location through a null pointer. This leads to a crash.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The code fails to properly validate or handle empty or uninitialized values in specific XSLT constructs (`xsl:key` and the `document()` function).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a crash of the application using libxslt, leading to a denial of service. This means the application becomes unavailable or unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted XSLT Documents:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious XSLT document that includes either an `xsl:key` with an empty `match` attribute or calls `document()` with an uninitialized variable.
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely because the attacker only needs to trick a user or automated system into processing the specially crafted XSLT document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Malicious XSLT:** The attacker needs the ability to supply or get the targeted system to process a specially crafted XSLT file. This could be achieved in various ways such as tricking a user into opening a malicious XML file that uses a vulnerable stylesheet or through an application that loads stylesheets from untrusted sources.
*   **No Special Privileges:** Exploitation does not require any special privileges on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Nicolas Gregoire.
*   Patches were created to properly handle empty values in affected functions. These patches involve checks for empty values before attempting to dereference them.
*   Multiple distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, Mageia, openSUSE) were affected.
