Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect usage of the `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` option in the libcurl API within Zabbix. The code was setting this option to `1L`, which does not perform proper host verification, instead of `2L` which enables full verification of the server's certificate against the hostname in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient SSL/TLS Host Verification:** By setting `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` to `1`, Zabbix only checks for the presence of a Common Name field in the server's SSL certificate, without verifying if that name matches the hostname it's trying to connect to. This allows for a potential Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack where an attacker can present a certificate with any valid Common Name, even if it doesn't belong to the intended server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker can intercept the communication between Zabbix and an external server if they can control the network path. By presenting a malicious SSL certificate, the attacker can potentially eavesdrop on or modify the data exchanged between Zabbix and the server. This can result in:
    - Data compromise of sensitive information sent to the external service.
    - Manipulation of data returned by the external service, potentially affecting Zabbix's functionality or integrity.
    - Complete compromise of the Zabbix client if the service contains a vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the Zabbix server/proxy and the external server it's communicating with.
- **Malicious SSL Certificate:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a valid but malicious SSL certificate during the TLS handshake.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network-level access to intercept communications between Zabbix and the external server.
- **SSL/TLS Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SSL/TLS to generate a malicious certificate.
- **MitM capabilities:** The attacker would need to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and modify the network traffic.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `eztexting.c` file in Zabbix.
- The fix was implemented in Zabbix versions 1.8.18rc1, 2.0.8rc1 and 2.1.2.
- The issue was discovered and reported by Alessandro Ghedini from the Debian security team.
- The issue is considered a minor security risk by Zabbix.
- The vulnerability was present in Zabbix version 2.0.3.
- As of curl v7.28.1 the value "1" for `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` is no longer a valid value and libcurl will return an error.
