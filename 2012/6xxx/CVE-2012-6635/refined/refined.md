Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from the fact that WordPress was displaying post excerpts even when a user did not have the necessary permissions to read the full post. Specifically, in the admin post list table view (in "excerpt" mode), the excerpt of a post was displayed without checking if the current user had the 'read_post' capability for that particular post. This could lead to information disclosure, as users without proper access could view the post's excerpt.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Displaying post excerpts to unauthorized users.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to partial content (excerpts) of posts they were not supposed to read. This could reveal sensitive information or give an adversary insights about the content structure of the site.

**Attack vectors:**

- A logged-in user with limited privileges would browse the WordPress admin post listing page using the 'excerpt' view. If a post existed they could not fully view, the excerpt would still be rendered, leading to information disclosure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must be a logged-in user.
- The attacker must have limited read access to certain posts.

**Additional details:**

- The fix was implemented by adding a capability check ('current_user_can( 'read_post', $post->ID )') before displaying a post excerpt in the `wp-admin/includes/class-wp-posts-list-table.php` file.
- This fix was part of a larger security release that addressed multiple vulnerabilities (WordPress version 3.3.3).
- This vulnerability was also fixed in WordPress versions 3.4.0 and 3.4.1.
