Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of the `clipText` variable within the ZeroClipboard Flash application before it's passed back to the JavaScript environment. This allows for the injection of malicious code into the clipboard. Additionally, the swf files were also vulnerable to XSS via the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via clipboard:** The Flash application doesn't sanitize the copied text before passing it back to the JavaScript, enabling the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the clipboard. When pasted into a web page, this code can then be executed.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via URL Parameter:** The `id` parameter of the ZeroClipboard.swf files is vulnerable to XSS, specifically when the vulnerable version of the flash file is loaded with an injected JavaScript payload in the `id` URL parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware installation
    *   Defacement of websites
*   **Clipboard Manipulation:** The attacker can manipulate the content of the user's clipboard to inject malicious links, text or other data that could lead to phishing or other attacks when pasted into other applications.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Clipboard XSS:** The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the clipboard by tricking a user into copying data via the vulnerable ZeroClipboard flash app.
*   **URL Parameter XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `id` parameter of the ZeroClipboard.swf file URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Clipboard XSS:** The attacker needs a way to make a user copy text via the ZeroClipboard flash app. This can be achieved if the attacker can control the content of a website which uses the vulnerable flash app.
*   **URL Parameter XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to open a manipulated URL pointing to the vulnerable flash application that includes the malicious payload.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects ZeroClipboard versions 1.0.7 and earlier.
*   The issue was fixed in later versions: one XSS was fixed in version 1.0.8 and another one in version 1.1.4. The latest version at the time of the report, 1.1.7, was not affected.
*   The fix involved escaping the `clipText` in the ActionScript code before passing it to the JavaScript environment (as shown in the github commit diff)
*   The exploit for XSS via URL parameters requires setting the width and height parameter in official versions of ZeroClipboard.
*   The vulnerability was found in multiple websites and applications and the `zeroclipboard.swf` files are found in a wide number of sites.
*   The github commit shows the exact code change that addressed the XSS vulnerability via clipboard injection: by splitting the clipText with `\` and rejoining with `\\`, it escapes the backslashes before sending the data to JavaScript.
