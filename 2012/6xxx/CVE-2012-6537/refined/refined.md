```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `xfrm_user` implementation in the Linux kernel copies data to user space using structures with padding bytes added by the compiler for alignment. These padding bytes could contain uninitialized memory, leading to information leaks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities could exploit this flaw to examine parts of kernel memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system is required to send specific system calls (e.g., via ioctl calls or getsockopt) to trigger the vulnerable code paths in the `xfrm_user` module."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities to exploit this vulnerability. For some cases related to network information disclosure, CAP_NET_ADMIN is not needed."
