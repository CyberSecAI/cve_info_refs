**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Splunk Web.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected XSS type, meaning the malicious script is injected into the application through a crafted URL or input, and then reflected back to the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could trick an authenticated Splunk Web user into clicking a maliciously crafted link. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the user's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the web page, all within the context of the authenticated user.
- The vulnerability does not have a direct impact on the Splunk server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a maliciously crafted link that is designed to inject script code into Splunk Web.
- The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user into clicking this link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince an authenticated user to click on the malicious link. This could be achieved through social engineering techniques, like embedding the link in an email or a webpage.

**Affected Product and Component:**
- Splunk 5.0.0 to 5.0.2 are affected by the reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Splunk version 5.0.3 or later.
- Implement the security hardening standards as described in the Securing Splunk documentation.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by the Groupon Security team.
- Splunk uses CVSS version 2 to standardize the calculation of severity scores.
