Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of authentication and authorization commands by the remote shell server (rshd) on the affected Linux-based Cisco Prime LMS Virtual Appliance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper authentication and authorization checks.
- The rshd service, which is vulnerable is listening on TCP port 514.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the root user on the affected system. This allows for complete control of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker can connect to the affected system over TCP port 514 and send arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the affected system over the network on TCP port 514.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Linux-based Cisco Prime LMS Virtual Appliances. Windows and Solaris versions of Cisco Prime LMS are not affected.
- A workaround is provided, which involves editing the `/etc/securetty` file and removing the `rsh` service command line.
- Metasploit has functional exploit code for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a support case.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is a base score of 10.0 and a temporal score of 8.3.
- Cisco has released patches to address this vulnerability.
