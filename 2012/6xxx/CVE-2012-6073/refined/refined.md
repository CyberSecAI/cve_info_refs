```
- Root cause of vulnerability: An open redirect vulnerability in Jenkins.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Open redirect.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can create a URL that appears to point to the Jenkins server but redirects the user to a site controlled by the attacker, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to know the URL of the Jenkins installation but does not require authentication.
