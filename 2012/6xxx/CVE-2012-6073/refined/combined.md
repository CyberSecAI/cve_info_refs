| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=890607#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-12-28 05:49:05 UTC  ```  Jenkins Security Advisory 2012-11-20  The first vulnerability is commonly known as HTTP response splitting  vulnerability, which can act as a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This  allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages served by  Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his privileges by  hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack, the attacker needs  to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation. This vulnerability  affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in servlet container (this  includes all the native packages.)  Fix: Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.491 LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.1  External URLs: [https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2012-11-20](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2012-11-20) <http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-advisory/jenkins-security-advisory-2012-11-20.cb>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=890607#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-31 20:34:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEL 6 Version of OpenShift Enterprise  Via RHSA-2013:0220 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0220.html>   ``` |  |

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service
(PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Refer to the Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 Release Notes for information
about the changes in this release. The Release Notes will be available
shortly from <https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/>

This update also fixes the following security issues:

It was found that the master cryptographic key of Jenkins could be
retrieved via the HTTP server that is hosting Jenkins. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to access the server and execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Jenkins. Note that this issue only
affected Jenkins instances that had slaves attached and that also allowed
anonymous read access (not the default configuration). Manual action is
also required to correct this issue. Refer to "Jenkins Security Advisory
2013-01-04", linked to in the References, for further information.
(CVE-2013-0158)

When the rhc-chk script was run in debug mode, its output included
sensitive information, such as database passwords, in plain text. As this
script is commonly used when troubleshooting, this flaw could lead to users
unintentionally exposing sensitive information in support channels (for
example, a Bugzilla report). This update removes the rhc-chk script.
(CVE-2012-5658)

Multiple flaws in the Jenkins web interface could allow a remote attacker
to perform HTTP response splitting and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks,
as well as redirecting a victim to an arbitrary page by utilizing an open
redirect flaw. (CVE-2012-6072, CVE-2012-6074, CVE-2012-6073)

A flaw was found in the way rubygem-activerecord dynamic finders extracted
options from method parameters. A remote attacker could possibly use this
flaw to perform SQL injection attacks against applications using the Active
Record dynamic finder methods. (CVE-2012-6496)

The openshift-port-proxy-cfg program created a temporary file in an
insecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic
link attack, overwriting an arbitrary file accessible to the root user with
a "0" or a "1", which could lead to a denial of service. By default,
OpenShift uses polyinstantiation (per user) for the /tmp/ directory,
minimizing the risk of exploitation by local attackers. (CVE-2013-0164)

The CVE-2013-0164 issue was discovered by Michael Scherer of the Red Hat
Regional IT team.

Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.0 are advised to upgrade to Red Hat
OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2012-11-20

This advisory announces two security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.

## Description

* The first vulnerability is commonly known as [HTTP response splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting) vulnerability, which can act as a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages served by Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his privileges by hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack, the attacker needs to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation. This vulnerability affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in servlet container (this includes all the native packages.) (CVE-2012-6072)
* The second vulnerability is so-called [open redirect](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html) vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to create an URL that looks as if it’s pointing to Jenkins, yet it actually lands on the site that the attacker controls. This can be therefore used as a basis for phishing. (CVE-2012-6073)
* The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that allows an attacker with some degree of write access in Jenkins to embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins. (CVE-2012-6074)

These vulnerabilities are discovered by [Soroush Dalili](https://soroush.secproject.com/), and we’d like to thank him.

## Severity

These combined vulnerabilities are rated as **high**, as they allow malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. On the other hands, this attack can be only mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.

## Fix

* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.491
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.1

All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

Adding Kohsuke Kawaguchi to the CC since he seems to be a Jenkins
security related person. Also if you need CVE's for Jenkins (or any
other major Open Source project your participate in, this goes for
everyone) in future contact me and they can be assigned prior to
advisory release which makes life easier for everyone.

Yup they appear to be new (the last batch I did is acknowledged in the
earlier security advisory from Jenkins).

From:
[https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2012-11-20](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2012-11-20)

vulnerability, which can act as a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
This allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages
served by Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his
privileges by hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack,
the attacker needs to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation.
This vulnerability affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in

Please use CVE-2012-6072 for this issue.

The second vulnerability is so-called open redirect vulnerability.
This allows an anonymous attacker to create an URL that looks as if
it's pointing to Jenkins, yet it actually lands on the site that the
attacker controls. This can be therefore used as a basis for phishing.

Please use CVE-2012-6073 for this issue.

The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that
allows an attacker with some degree of write access in Jenkins to
embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins.

Please use CVE-2012-6074 for this issue.

# CloudBees Security Advisory 2012-11-19

This advisory announces two security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.

The first vulnerability is commonly known as [HTTP response splitting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting) vulnerability, which can act as a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages served by Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his privileges by hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack, the attacker needs to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation. This vulnerability affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in servlet container (this includes all the native packages.)

The second vulnerability is so-called [open redirect](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html) vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to create an URL that looks as if it's pointing to Jenkins, yet it actually lands on the site that the attacker controls. This can be therefore used as a basis for phishing.

The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that allows an attacker with some degree of write access in Jenkins to embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins.

These vulnerabilities are discovered by [Soroush Dalili](http://soroush.secproject.com/) , and we'd like to thank him.

### Severity

CloudBees rates these vulnerabilities as **high** , when combined, as they allow malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. On the other hands, this attack can be only mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.

### Fix

* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.491

This  allows an anonymous attacker to create an URL that looks as if it's pointing  to Jenkins, yet it actually lands on the site that the attacker controls.  This can be therefore used as a basis for phishing.  Fix: Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.491 LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.1  External URLs: [https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2012-11-20](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2012-11-20) <http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-advisory/jenkins-security-advisory-2012-11-20.cb>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=890608#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-31 20:34:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEL 6 Version of OpenShift Enterprise  Via RHSA-2013:0220 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0220.html>   ``` |  |
