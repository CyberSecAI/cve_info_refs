# RAR and UnRAR: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201708-05**

An integer overflow in RAR and UnRAR might allow remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/rar** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.5.0\_beta4\_p20170628** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.5.0\_beta4\_p20170628** |

| Package | **app-arch/unrar** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.5.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.5.5** |

### Background

RAR and UnRAR provide command line interfaces for compressing and
decompressing RAR files.

### Description

A VMSF\_DELTA memory corruption was discovered in which an integer
overflow can be caused in DataSize+CurChannel. The result is a negative
value of the “DestPos” variable which allows writing out of bounds
when setting Mem[DestPos].

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to open a specially crafted
archive, could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All RAR users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-arch/rar-5.5.0_beta4_p20170628"

```

All UnRAR users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/unrar-5.5.5"

```
