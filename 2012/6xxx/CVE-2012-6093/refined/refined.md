Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-6093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `QSslSocket` implementation in the Qt framework handles certificate verification callbacks. Specifically, when Qt libraries are used with a different OpenSSL version than the one they were compiled against, it can lead to incorrect error reporting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Error Reporting:** When an SSL certificate verification fails due to an OpenSSL version mismatch, `QSslSocket` reports `QSslError:NoError` instead of a more specific error related to the certificate issue.
*   **Potential for User Misinterpretation:** The incorrect error reporting could lead users to believe there are no issues with the SSL connection, potentially encouraging them to ignore SSL errors and proceed with insecure connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confusing Error Messages:** Users may encounter misleading or unhelpful error messages regarding SSL connections.
*   **User Bypassing Security:**  Users might be inclined to ignore errors related to the connection, potentially connecting to malicious sites or being vulnerable to MITM attacks.
*   **MITM attacks:** While not directly part of the vulnerability, the incorrect error reporting could indirectly facilitate MITM attacks by making it less obvious to users that there's an issue with the connection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **OpenSSL Version Mismatch:** The primary attack vector involves running Qt applications with a different OpenSSL version than the one against which the Qt libraries were compiled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No specific attacker position required:** An attacker doesn't need a specific network position; the vulnerability is triggered by using a binary with mismatched OpenSSL versions.
*   **Influence over OpenSSL libraries used:** The attacker would need to either provide the affected application with a mismatched version of OpenSSL or have the user run an application configured with a mismatched version.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is more likely to affect systems that dynamically load OpenSSL. Systems where Qt is linked statically to OpenSSL are less likely to be vulnerable.
*   Several Linux distributions were affected including Ubuntu, openSUSE, and Debian.
*   Patches address the issue by correctly reporting the underlying error and by blacklisting known bad SSL certificates.
*   The issue was addressed in Qt versions 4.8.5, 4.7.6, and 4.6.5.
