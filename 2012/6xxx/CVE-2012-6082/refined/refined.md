Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-6082

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `rsslink()` function in the `theme/__init__.py` file of MoinMoin Wiki version 1.9.5. This function fails to properly escape the page name parameter when generating RSS links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input sanitization. Specifically, the page name parameter used in the `rsslink()` function is not properly escaped before being used in an RSS link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the page name parameter. When a user clicks on the crafted RSS link, the injected script will execute in the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the wiki
*   Redirection to malicious sites
*   Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted RSS link. An attacker can create a page with a malicious name, or manipulate an existing link, which when visited by a user will cause the injection to trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a page on the MoinMoin wiki, or control a link that directs to an RSS link.
*   The attacker needs to know that the vulnerability exists and craft the malicious payload.
