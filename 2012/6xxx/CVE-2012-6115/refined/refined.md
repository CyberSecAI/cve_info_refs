Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `rhevm-manage-domains` tool, when performing a `validate` action, was logging administrative passwords to a world-readable log file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Logging:**  The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive credentials (administrative passwords) in a log file accessible to all users.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The log file had insufficient access controls, allowing any local user to potentially read it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation/System Compromise:** A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain control of systems managed by Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager (RHEV-M). By obtaining administrative passwords, they could perform unauthorized actions on the RHEV-M environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the system where `rhevm-manage-domains` was run with the `validate` action.
*   **Log File Access:** Attackers would need to access the world-readable log file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker would need a local user account on the system where `rhevm-manage-domains` was executed.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read the log file, which was world-readable.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager version 3.1 through the RHSA-2013:0211 security advisory.
* The issue was discovered by Andrew Cathrow of Red Hat.
* The fix involved preventing the logging of passwords in the specified log file.
