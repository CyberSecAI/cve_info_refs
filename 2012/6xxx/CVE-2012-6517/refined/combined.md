Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory researcher discovered multiple web vulnerabilities in DIY v1.0 Content Management System.

Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-16:     Public or Non-Public Disclosure

Status:
========
Published

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote

Severity:
=========
High

Details:
========
1.1
A SQL Injection vulnerability  is detected in DIY v1.0 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                           [+] Mod - Poll

1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected  in DIY v1.0 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing
& client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                           [+] Poll - Question & Answer Input/Output

1.3
A cross site request forgery vulnerability is detected  in DIY v1.0 Content Management System. The bugs allow remote
attackers with high required user inter action to edit user accounts. Successful exploitation can lead to account
access.
To exploit the issue the attacker need to create a manipulated copy the edit user mask/form. Inside of the document the
remote can implement his own values for the update because of no form or token protection. When admin get now forced to
execute the script via link he is executing the new value on the update of the application if his session is not
expired.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                           [+] &modfile=add

Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action.
Exploitation requires the possibility to allow an attacker to add or config a poll.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
diy-cms/mod.php?mod=poll&start=`[SQL-INJECTION]--

1.2
The cross site vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
diy-cms/modules/poll/add.php[Cross Site Scripting]

1.3
The cross site request forgery vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with high required user inter
action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

<form action="http://127.0.0.1/diy/mod.php?mod=poll&modfile=add"; method="post" name="add_poll"
enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="hidden" name='polltype' value='1'>

<input type="hidden" name="question" value="<script>alert(1)</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="answer1" value="<script>alert(1)</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="answer2" value="<script>alert(1)</script>">

<input type="hidden" name='active' value='1' checked>
<input type=submit name='submit' value=XSS></td>
</form>

Solution:
=========
1.1

In file /diy-cms/modules/poll/index.php
line: 50 - 55

$ppp = $mod->setting(/`polls_per_page/`);
                if(!isset($_GET[/`start/`]))
                {$start = /`0/`;

                $start = $_GET[/`start/`];
                }

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Severity Level:
===============
High
Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in DIY v1.0 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Mod - Poll
1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected in DIY v1.0 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing
& client-side content request manipulation.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Poll - Question & Answer Input/Output
1.3
A cross site request forgery vulnerability is detected in DIY v1.0 Content Management System. The bugs allow remote
attackers with high required user inter action to edit user accounts. Successful exploitation can lead to account access.
To exploit the issue the attacker need to create a manipulated copy the edit user mask/form. Inside of the document the
remote can implement his own values for the update because of no form or token protection. When admin get now forced to
execute the script via link he is executing the new value on the update of the application if his session is not expired.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] &modfile=add
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action.
Exploitation requires the possibility to allow an attacker to add or config a poll.
For demonstration or reproduce ...
PoC:
diy-cms/mod.php?mod=poll&start=`[SQL-INJECTION]--
1.2
The cross site vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...
PoC:
diy-cms/modules/poll/add.php[Cross Site Scripting]
1.3
The cross site request forgery vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with high required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

$ppp = $mod->setting(/`polls\_per\_page/`);
if(!isset($\_GET[/`start/`]))
{$start = /`0/`;
}else{
$start = $\_GET[/`start/`];
}
we edit to:

if(!isset($\_GET[/`start/`]))
{$start = /`0/`;
}else{
$start = (int)$\_GET[/`start/`];
