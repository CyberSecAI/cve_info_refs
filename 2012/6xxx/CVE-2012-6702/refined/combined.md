# Android Security Bulletin—November 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published November 07, 2016 | Updated December 21, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the
[Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of November 06, 2016 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the
[Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on October 20,
2016 or earlier. Where applicable, source code patches for these issues have
been released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository. This
bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the
[Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as
[SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* With the introduction of the Pixel and Pixel XL devices, the term for
  [all devices supported by Google](#google-devices) is
  "Google devices" instead of "Nexus devices."
* This bulletin has three security patch levels to provide Android partners
  with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are
  similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2016-11-01**: Partial security patch level. This security
    patch level indicates that all issues associated with 2016-11-01 (and all
    previous security patch level) are addressed.
  + **2016-11-05**: Complete security patch level. This security
    patch level indicates that all issues associated with 2016-11-01 and 2016-11-05
    (and all previous security patch levels) are addressed.
  + **Supplemental security patch levels**

    Supplemental security patch levels are provided to identify devices
    that contain fixes for issues that were publicly disclosed after the
    patch level was defined. Addressing these recently disclosed
    vulnerabilities is not required until the 2016-12-01 security patch level.

    - **2016-11-06**: This security patch level indicates that the
      device has addressed all issues associated with 2016-11-05 and CVE-2016-5195,
      which was publicly disclosed on October 19, 2016.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the November
  05, 2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with
  [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

Please excuse bumping this thread.  It think it may need another CVE:

The call to srand(3) can reduce the security of the calling application,
depending on what it is doing with srand(3)/random(3).  This behavior is
recognized as a bug by Fedora, too
(<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1197087>).

There are multiple related commits in Expat's Git repository.  I am
happy to extract a single to-the-point patch for your version of Expat
and operating system platform from that for you, if needed.

Best

Sebastian

#### Description

The tls\_decrypt\_ticket function in ssl/t1\_lib.c in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not consider the HMAC size during validation of the ticket length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a ticket that is too short.

Package        : expat
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-6702 CVE-2016-5300

Two related issues have been discovered in Expat, a C library for parsing
XML.

CVE-2012-6702

    It was introduced when CVE-2012-0876 was addressed. Stefan SÃ¸rensen
    discovered that the use of the function XML_Parse() seeds the random
    number generator generating repeated outputs for rand() calls.

CVE-2016-5300

      It is the product of an incomplete solution for CVE-2012-0876. The
      parser poorly seeds the random number generator allowing an
      attacker to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML
      file with crafted identifiers.

You might need to manually restart programs and services using expat
libraries.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-6+deb8u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.1-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# [R3] PVS 5.2.0 Fixes Multiple Third-party Library Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable's Passive Vulnerability Scanner (PVS) uses third-party libraries to provide certain standardized functionality. Four of these libraries were found to contain vulnerabilities and were fixed upstream. Those fixes have been integrated despite there being no known exploitation scenarios related to PVS.

* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem.c read\_state\_machine() Function Message Handling Use-after-free Remote Code Execution
* OpenSSL CRL Handling Unspecified NULL Pointer Dereference DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c ssl\_parse\_clienthello\_tlsext() Function OCSP Status Request Extension Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL Certificate Message Handling Limited Out-of-bounds Read DoS Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_dtls.c dtls1\_preprocess\_fragment() Function DTLS Message Handling Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/record/rec\_layer\_s3.c SSL\_peek() Function Empty Record Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL ssl/statem/statem\_lib.c tls\_get\_message\_header() Function Memory Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/mdc2/mdc2dgst.c MDC2\_Update() Function Buffer Overflow Weakness
* OpenSSL ssl/t1\_lib.c tls\_decrypt\_ticket() Function Ticket HMAC Digest Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Buffered Message Saturation Queue Exhaustion Remote DoS
* OpenSSL DTLS Implementation Record Epoch Sequence Number Handling Remote DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/bn/bn\_print.c BN\_bn2dec() Function BIGNUM Handling Buffer Overflow DoS
* OpenSSL crypto/ts/ts\_lib.c TS\_OBJ\_print\_bio() Function Out-of-bounds Read Issue
* OpenSSL crypto/dsa/dsa\_ossl.c DSA Signing Algorithm Constant Time Failure Side-channel Attack Information Disclosure
* OpenSSL Integer Overflow Unspecified Weakness
* Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (3DES) 64-bit Block Size Birthday Attack HTTPS Cookie MitM Disclosure (SWEET32)
* SQLite Insecure Temporary Directory Usage Local Issue
* Expat XML Parser Input Document Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c XML\_GetBuffer() Function Compressed XML Content Handling Buffer Overflow
* Expat lib/xmlparse.c generate\_hash\_secret\_salt() Function PRNG Non-random Output Generation Weakness
* Expat xmlparse.c Hash Table Collision DoS
* jQuery UI dialog() Function closeText Parameter XSS

Note that the CVSSv2 score associated with this advisory is specific to the OpenSSL integration into PVS and assumes a worst-case scenario. These updates are proactive; Tenable has had no reports of exploitation and some of these issues may not impact PVS at all. Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that PVS be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

Additionally, a reflected XSS vulnerability affecting the PVS Web GUI was fixed in the HTML 1.7.1 and Web Server 1.8.0 updates delivered via the plugin feed on November 14, 2016. A default install of PVS 5.2.0 includes these fixes. This issue was reported to us by Kaustubh Padwad. Tenable thanks him for privately reporting the issue to us.

### Solution

Tenable has released version 5.2.0 that corresponds to the supported operating systems and architectures. This version bundles the updated OpenSSL library (1.0.2j), jQuery UI (1.12.0), Expat (2.2.0), and SQLite (3.13.0), which are not affected. The new version is available at:

The text below assigns one CVE ID to this expat vulnerability.

>> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1197087#c6>
>>
>> Expat is calling srand ... [if] the code using Expat ... never called
>> XML_SetHashSalt on that parser ... the arrival of XML_SetHashSalt
>> bypassed the Expat user's radar

>>> <https://sourceforge.net/p/expat/bugs/499/>
>>> 2012-04-05
>>> In any case, you can supply your own hash salt - after creating the
>>> parser, but before parsing is started. See the new API function XML_SetHashSalt.

The higher-level issue, from our perspective, is that a library
(intended for use in arbitrary applications) should not have
potentially unavoidable calls to the srand function unless this is
documented. The library might be used by an application in which srand
was already called exactly once, and srand/rand happens to be the
right choice for that application because of a minimal need for
randomness, and this minimal need for randomness is no longer
satisfied if there are unexpected extra calls to srand.

In other words, good options for a library include:

  - never call srand under any circumstances

  - call srand only if the application calls a library function that
    is documented as triggering an srand call

  - call srand whenever it wants, as long as the documentation warns
    application authors about potential incompatibility with any use
    of srand within an application

We really don't know whether the above is a generally accepted
principle for all libraries. However, it appears that the expat vendor
is recognizing the old behavior (i.e., the behavior before
XML_SetHashSalt was available and documented) as a security-relevant
implementation error. Use CVE-2012-6702.

An entirely separate question is whether generate_hash_secret_salt
should ultimately be using the rand function to attempt to provide a
random number, or whether it should provide a better quality random
number. There is no CVE ID for this yet. If the expat upstream
maintainer is announcing a new expat release, specifically stating
that discontinuing use of the rand function represents a vulnerability
fix, then a CVE ID can be assigned.

One might make a design assertion that every portable library and
application, if it potentially has a need for good random numbers, is
supposed to have its own code that is able to call each of getrandom,
CryptGenRandom, and arc4random_buf on the applicable OS (as suggested
in <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1197087#c28>). We don't
feel that CVE is the right way to track that assertion's viability or
adherence.

# Expat: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201701-21**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Expat, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/expat** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.0-r1** |

### Background

Expat is a set of XML parsing libraries.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Expat. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by enticing a user to process a specially crafted XML
file, could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or
cause a Denial of Service condition. This attack could also be used
against automated systems that arbitrarily process XML files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Expat users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/expat-2.2.0-r1"

```

#### Description

The XML parser (xmlparse.c) in expat before 2.1.0 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML file with many identifiers with the same value.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.
