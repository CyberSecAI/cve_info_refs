Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability CVE-2012-6702:

*   **Description:** Expat, when used in a parser that has not called `XML_SetHashSalt` or passed it a seed of 0, makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via vectors involving use of the `srand` function.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the predictable seeding of the random number generator when `XML_Parse()` is used and `XML_SetHashSalt` is not called with a non-zero seed. This is related to a previous fix for CVE-2012-0876.
*   **Weakness:** Predictable random number generation when the hash salt is not explicitly set in Expat XML parser. An application using the library might be calling `srand` already, but the expat library's call will disrupt the application's own usage of `srand` and `rand` functions.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to potentially bypass cryptographic protections due to the predictable nature of the random number generator. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML file with crafted identifiers.
*   **Attack Vector:** By enticing a user to process a specially crafted XML file. This can affect automated systems that process XML files, which makes the attack surface broader than just interactive user applications.
*   **Affected Systems:** Systems using Expat XML parser versions before the fix was applied. Some sources indicate that supported Google devices on Android 7.0 or later that have installed all available updates are not affected by this vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** Call `XML_SetHashSalt` with a randomly generated seed. Upgrade to patched versions of Expat.
