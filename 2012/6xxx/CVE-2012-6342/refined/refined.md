  "CVE-2012-6342": {
    "description": "Multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Confluence 3.0 and below allow remote attackers to submit actions on their behalf. Newer versions may also be vulnerable.",
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly check each URL, which allows an attacker to execute requests on behalf of a legitimate user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can submit actions on behalf of a legitimate user, including actions that could log the user out.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Adding a comment to a page with a crafted image tag containing a logout URL. Visiting the page would trigger the logout action.",
      "Adding the comment to anyone's profile would force them to log out when they log in."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to add content to a Confluence page, such as a comment.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability was reported in 2011, but was marked as 'Won't Fix' 1.5 years later. The specific vulnerable component is 'logout.action'. The vulnerability exists in Atlassian Confluence versions 3.0 and below, possibly affecting newer versions as well. The authentication required depends on the configuration. The attack can be performed remotely. A proof of concept exploit demonstrates how to force logouts."
