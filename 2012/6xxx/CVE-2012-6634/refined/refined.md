The provided content relates to CVE-2012-6634. It describes a security update for WordPress version 3.3.3 that addresses multiple vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerabilities stem from insufficient checks and sanitization of user-supplied data, and lack of proper authorization checks when handling media uploads and post data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A persistent XSS vulnerability existed via editable slug fields.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Some post IDs were not properly restricted during media uploads, potentially leaking information or allowing media to be attached to posts the user doesn't have privileges to.
    *   Post excerpts were not hidden when a user could not read the entire post, revealing partial content.
*   **CSRF Hardening:** Unfiltered HTML could be included in comments under certain conditions (potential for clickjacking when the front-end is loaded in a frame).
*  **Hardening:**
    * The `wp_explain_nonce()` function could reveal unnecessary information and was deprecated.
    * A child theme could be activated with an unintended parent theme.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to information they are not authorized to view, such as post IDs, unauthorized media uploads and partial post content.
* **CSRF:** Could lead to users being tricked into submitting malicious data or unintended actions.
* **Hardening Issues:** Could reveal sensitive information or lead to unintended site configurations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **XSS:** By crafting a malicious input in an editable slug field.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    * By manipulating media upload requests.
    * By viewing post excerpts when they lack permission to see the full post.
*   **CSRF:** Through tricking a user into submitting a comment containing unfiltered HTML while the site is loaded in an iframe.
* **Hardening Issues:** Exploiting the ability to activate child themes with incorrect parents and using the `wp_explain_nonce()` function to gain information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker needs the ability to create or edit content containing editable slug fields.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker needs to be a user of the system and be able to upload media or access post content, or be able to manipulate media upload requests.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker must trick a user into performing actions while the vulnerable site is loaded in an iframe.

**Additional Information**
The changes in `wp-admin/media-upload.php` were implemented to restrict media uploads to a post the user has 'edit_post' capability on, preventing information disclosure.
The fixes in version 3.3.3 were backported from the 3.4 branch.
