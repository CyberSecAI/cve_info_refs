Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from unspecified issues within the Autonomy KeyView IDOL file parser library. Specifically, it is described as "a number of underlying issues" that lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary weakness is memory corruption resulting from processing a crafted file. Some cases demonstrated memory corruption with attacker-controlled input which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **File Parsing Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies within the way Autonomy KeyView IDOL parses files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using the vulnerable library. Depending on the application this could be SYSTEM level or the equivalent.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption issues can cause an affected application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In the context of software like IBM Lotus Domino, a successful exploit could lead to code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacks:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted file to an affected application that uses the vulnerable Autonomy Keyview IDOL library.
*   **Crafted Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially-crafted files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to deliver crafted files:** The attacker needs to deliver a specially crafted file to a vulnerable system. This could be through email attachments, web uploads, or other file transfer methods.
*   **No user interaction may be necessary** for some affected products.

**Affected Products:**

The vulnerability affects multiple products that utilize the vulnerable Autonomy KeyView IDOL library, including, but not limited to:

*   IBM Lotus Domino 8.5.x prior to 8.5.3 FP4
*   IBM Notes 8.5.x
*   Symantec Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange prior to 6.5.8
*   Symantec Mail Security for Domino prior to 8.1.1
*   Symantec Messaging Gateway prior to 10.0.1
*   Symantec Data Loss Prevention (DLP) prior to 11.6.1
*   Other products that use Autonomy KeyView IDOL.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Autonomy Keyview IDOL 10.16.
*   Mitigation techniques like EMET and DEP can offer some protection but are not full workarounds.
