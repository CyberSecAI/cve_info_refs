#### Synopsis

The remote web server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.
#### Description

According to its banner, the version of Lotus Domino on the remote host is 8.5.x earlier than 8.5.3 FP4. It is, therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :

 - An error exists related to the 'Autonomy KeyView' file parser that could allow arbitrary code execution.
 (CVE-2012-6277)

 - A memory leak error exists that could allow an attacker to crash the application. (CVE-2013-0486)

 - An error exists related to time-limited authentication credentials and the Java console that could allow an authenticated user to elevate privileges.
 (CVE-2013-0487)
#### Solution

Upgrade to Lotus Domino 8.5.3 FP4 or later.

## Autonomy Keyview IDOL contains multiple vulnerabilities in file parsers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#849841

Original Release Date: 2012-11-20 | Last Revised: 2014-01-28

---

### Overview

[Autonomy Keyview IDOL](http://www.autonomy.com/content/Products/idol-modules-connectors/index.en.html) contains multiple vulnerabilities in file parsers. These vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

### Description

| [Autonomy Keyview IDOL](http://www.autonomy.com/content/Products/idol-modules-connectors/index.en.html) is a set of libraries that can decode over [1,000 different file formats](http://www.autonomy.com/content/Technology/idol-functionality-information-connectivity/index.en.html). The Autonomy Keyview IDOL libraries are used by a variety of applications, including IBM Lotus Notes, Lotus Domino, Symantec Mail Security, RSA DLP, VMware Zimbra, Hyland OnBase, and many others. These vulnerabilities result from a number of underlying issues. Some of these cases demonstrated memory corruption with attacker-controlled input and could be exploited to run arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By causing an application to process a specially-crafted file with the Autonomy Keyview IDOL library, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause an affected application to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Depending on what application is using Keyview IDOL, these may happen as the result of some user interaction, such as single-clicking on a file, or it may happen with no user interaction at all. Privileges that the code would execute with depend on the application in question. For example, an attacker that exploits Symantec Mail Security or IBM Lotus Domino would be able to achieve code execution with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in Autonomy Keyview IDOL 10.16. Please see your vendor for relevant product updates that include this version of Keyview. |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. CERT/CC has created a [video tutorial for setting up EMET 3.0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28_LUs_g0u4) on Windows 7. Note that platforms that do not support ASLR, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, will not receive the same level of protection that modern Windows platforms will.**Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows**Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: [On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx) for more details. |

### Simple and Effective Vulnerability Identification Approach Vulnerability scanners are great tools to identify vulnerabilities, but they have drawbacks.

Additionally, vulnerability scanning processes usually fail to scan software like web browsers, pdf readers, or word processors. And some hosts in IT infrastructure are not reachable by vulnerability scanners. Vulmon Alerts' proactive vulnerability identification approach lets you be aware of critical vulnerabilities without vulnerability scanning. Vulmon Alerts provide instant software vulnerability alerts. So you get notified about newly published vulnerabilities that affect your infrastructure in minutes. [Get Started](/register)

# Announcement Regarding Non-Cisco Product Security Alerts

On 2019 September 15, Cisco stopped publishing non-Cisco product alerts  alerts with vulnerability information about third-party software (TPS). Cisco will continue to publish Security Advisories to address both Cisco proprietary and TPS vulnerabilities per the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy. Cisco uses Release Note Enclosures to disclose the majority of TPS vulnerabilities; exceptions to this method are outlined in the Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities section of the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#3psv). The following links provide additional information.

**Vulnerability Information for Non-Cisco Products**

 National Vulnerability Database: <https://nvd.nist.gov>

 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures: <https://cve.mitre.org>

**Vulnerability Information for Cisco Products**

 Cisco Bug Search Tool: <https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch>

 Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/case>

**Cisco Security Policy and Advisories**

 Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html>

 Cisco Security Advisories: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x>
