Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6036:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from multiple issues within the Transcendent Memory (TMEM) hypercall implementation in Xen. Specifically, several sub-operations of the TMEM hypercall lack proper input validation, privilege validation, or contain other security-relevant bugs. These include:
*   TMEM save-related control operations not checking for NULL clients.
*   TMEM save-related control operations not checking guest output buffer pointers.
*  TMEM operations not checking for negative pool IDs.
*   `do_tmem_destroy_pool` not checking for invalid pool IDs.
*   `do_tmem_control`'s privilege check being commented out, allowing access to control stack operations.
*   `tmh_copy_from_client` and `tmh_copy_to_client` having an integer overflow vulnerability.
*   `do_tmem_get()`'s error path leaving a spinlock held.
*   `do_tmem_op` having error paths with broken locking checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Missing input validation:** Several TMEM sub-operations do not validate inputs such as client IDs, pool IDs and buffer pointers.
*   **Missing privilege validation:** The privilege check for `do_tmem_control` is disabled, allowing unprivileged guests to execute control operations.
*   **Integer overflow:**  The `tmh_copy_from_client` and `tmh_copy_to_client` functions are vulnerable to integer overflow.
*   **Locking issues:** Error paths in `do_tmem_get()` and `do_tmem_op` have broken locking checks, resulting in deadlocks or other locking related issues.
*   **NULL pointer dereferences:** Certain control operations can dereference NULL client pointers, leading to crashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Privilege escalation:** An unprivileged guest can overwrite hypervisor-owned memory with attacker-controlled content, allowing them to gain host privileges.
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** Guests can crash the hypervisor by triggering NULL pointer dereferences, or through locking issues, leading to a DoS. Memory corruption may also cause a DoS or even code execution.
*   **Memory corruption:**  Various issues such as incorrect buffer handling, integer overflows and missing input validation can lead to memory corruption in the hypervisor.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Malicious or compromised guest virtual machines.
*   Potentially malicious unprivileged users via a trusted TMEM-aware kernel (although considered unlikely).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Attacker must be able to execute code within a Xen guest VM.
*  TMEM must be enabled on the hypervisor via the command line option `tmem`.

**Additional notes:**
*   The TMEM functionality is described as a technology preview and is not recommended for production use.
* The advisory notes that the list of vulnerabilities provided is not exhaustive.
* Fixes for all known issues were not available at the time of the advisory.
