**Verification:**

The provided content clearly refers to **CVE-2012-5596** and not CVE-2012-6057. The content specifically mentions "CVE-2012-5596 Wireshark #5 DoS (infinite loop) in the EIGRP dissector (wnpa-sec-2012-34)". Therefore this content is UNRELATED to CVE-2012-6057.
 
**CVE-2012-5596 Analysis (Based on the provided content):**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A flaw in the EIGRP dissector within Wireshark causes it to enter an infinite loop when processing malformed EIGRP packets.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is present in the EIGRP dissector of Wireshark. The dissector fails to properly handle malformed packets, leading to a loop.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.  Wireshark will consume excessive CPU resources, potentially causing it to become unresponsive.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malformed Packet Injection:** An attacker can inject malformed EIGRP packets onto the network.
    *   **Malformed Packet Trace File:** An attacker can convince a user to open a malformed packet trace file that contains crafted EIGRP packets.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject packets onto a network being monitored by Wireshark or must be able to provide a malicious packet capture file to a user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Wireshark versions 1.8.0 to 1.8.3.
*   The issue is resolved in Wireshark version 1.8.4 and later.
*   The vulnerability is identified as wnpa-sec-2012-34.
