{
  "CVE-2012-6542": {
    "Description": "The Linux kernel, when built with Logical Link Control (LLC) protocol, has an information leakage flaw. It occurs while retrieving the socket name via the getsockname call. A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.",
    "Root cause": "The LLC code incorrectly returns success when the socket is zapped, leading to the use of an uninitialized uaddrlen pointer argument, causing arbitrary memory leak via the getsockname() syscall.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Leakage"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can leak kernel stack memory by exploiting the flaw.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local user can call the getsockname() system call on a zapped LLC socket.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user privileges are required to call the getsockname() syscall."
  },
   "CVE-2012-6545": {
    "Description": "The Linux kernel, when built with Bluetooth networking and RFCOMM protocol support, is vulnerable to information leakage flaws. These occur while calling getsockname, getsockopt(BT_SECURITY), and ioctl(RFCOMMGETDEVLIST) routines. A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.",
      "Root cause": "The Bluetooth RFCOMM implementation fails to properly initialize memory structures when calling getsockname, getsockopt(BT_SECURITY), and ioctl(RFCOMMGETDEVLIST), which allows a local attacker to leak kernel memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Leakage"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can leak kernel memory by exploiting the flawed routines.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local user can call the getsockname, getsockopt(BT_SECURITY), and ioctl(RFCOMMGETDEVLIST) routines on a vulnerable Bluetooth RFCOMM socket.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user privileges are required to interact with Bluetooth and call the vulnerable routines."
  },
  "CVE-2013-4592": {
     "Description": "A flaw was found in the way IOMMU memory mappings were handled when moving memory slots. A malicious user on a KVM host who has the ability to assign a device to a guest could use this flaw to crash the host.",
        "Root cause": "IOMMU pages are neither unpinned nor unmapped when a user memory slot is moved, leading to a memory leak. The memory for these pages cannot be recovered without rebooting the system.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak",
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user with the ability to assign a device could cause a denial of service by exhausting memory.",
     "Attack vectors": "A user with privileges to assign devices to a KVM guest can exploit the memory leak by repeatedly moving memory slots.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user with ability to assign device (access to PCI sysfs files for a device)."
