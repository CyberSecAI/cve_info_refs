Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `ok_message` and `error_message` parameters in the Roundup issue tracker. The application attempts to filter HTML tags in these parameters using a regular expression, but this filter is not strict enough and can be bypassed, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the flawed filtering mechanism for user-supplied messages.  The regular expression used to filter HTML tags is not comprehensive and allows for bypasses.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is an XSS flaw, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when they view a page with the injected message.
- **Potential for Data Theft/Manipulation:** With the ability to execute scripts, attackers can potentially steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or modify displayed content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL containing a specially crafted  `ok_message` or `error_message` parameter.
- **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can directly manipulate the URL to include their malicious payload.
   - Example: `http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/?@ok_message=%3C%3Cscript%20%3E%3Ealert(42)%3B5%3C%3C%2Fscript%20%3E%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** Attackers must be aware that the `ok_message` and `error_message` parameters are vulnerable and can be exploited for XSS.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** Attackers need to be able to create URLs with malicious scripts embedded within the vulnerable parameters.
- **Social Engineering (Optional):** While not strictly required, successful exploitation is more likely if the attacker can trick a user into clicking on the malicious link, as the payload is reflected in the response.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by completely disallowing HTML tags in the `ok_message` and `error_message` parameters in Roundup version 1.4.20.  The original attempt to filter tags via regex was abandoned for this more secure approach.
- There was a discussion about allowing certain HTML elements (like `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<a>`, `<br>`), but this was ultimately rejected in favor of the complete sanitization approach to mitigate the risk.
- The issue was reported by David Benjamin.
- The fix was implemented by Ralf Schlatterbeck with contributions from Ezio Melotti.
