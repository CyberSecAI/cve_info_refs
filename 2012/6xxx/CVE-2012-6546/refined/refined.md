Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an information leak in the Linux kernel's Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking stack. Specifically, the code failed to initialize padding bytes in the `sockaddr_atmpvc` structure when handling `getsockname()` and `getsockopt(SO_ATMPVC)` calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information leak: Kernel stack memory was being exposed to user space due to the lack of initialization of padding bytes in a data structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to examine parts of the kernel memory. Specifically, they could leak stack memory content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, requiring a user to execute code on the system to trigger the `getsockname()` or `getsockopt(SO_ATMPVC)` calls on ATM sockets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a local user account on the vulnerable system.
- No special privileges beyond that of an unprivileged user are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was present in the `vcc_getsockopt` function (for getsockopt calls) and in `pvc_getname` function (for getsockname calls), both within the ATM networking subsystem.
- The fix involved explicitly setting the memory to zero before filling the structure.
