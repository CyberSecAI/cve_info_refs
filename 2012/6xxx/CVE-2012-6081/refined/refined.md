Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `save` method in the `AnyWikiDraw` (`action/anywikidraw.py`) and `TWikiDraw` (`action/twikidraw.py`) classes in MoinMoin Wiki versions 1.9.x up to and including 1.9.5 do not properly filter user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The lack of input validation allows attackers to inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) into filenames or file paths.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Due to the path traversal, attackers can overwrite arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server user (typically `www-data`). Additionally the vulnerability in AttachFile allows for file overwriting via directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user by overwriting critical files, such as the application's `wsgi` file or plugin files.
*  **File Overwriting:** Attackers can overwrite files on the server via path traversal.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any user with write access to the MoinMoin wiki.
*  **Web Interface:** Exploitation is performed through the MoinMoin web interface by manipulating the `target` parameter in the `twikidraw` or `anywikidraw` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write Access:** Attackers need to have write access to a page on the MoinMoin wiki to exploit this vulnerability. This can be achieved by either having an account and the ability to edit existing pages, or the ability to create new pages if the application allows for that.
*   **Knowledge of MoinMoin:** Basic knowledge of the MoinMoin wiki structure and the existence of the vulnerable actions.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Exploit in the Wild:** The vulnerability was being actively exploited at the time of discovery.
*   **Fix:** A fix was released and is available on the project's repository.
*   **Affected Versions:** MoinMoin versions 1.9.x up to and including 1.9.5 are vulnerable.
*   **Exploit Scripts:** An example exploit is provided, which can write a webshell or a reverse shell.
*   **Ubuntu USN:** Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1680-1 addresses this vulnerability and provides updated packages for multiple Ubuntu releases.
*  **Debian DSA:** Debian Security Advisory DSA-2593-1 addresses this vulnerability as well.
