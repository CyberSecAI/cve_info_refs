Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-6693:

**Verification:**

The ICS Medical Advisory document explicitly lists CVE-2012-6693 as being assigned to "GE Centricity PACS Server". This confirms the relevance of the advisory to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of default or hard-coded credentials in GE Healthcare products, specifically the Centricity PACS Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the affected products use default or hard-coded usernames and passwords, making them easily accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Authentication:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to the affected devices/systems.
*   **Data Breach:** Potential access to sensitive patient data stored on the affected machines.
*   **System Manipulation:** There is a risk of unauthorized changes to the configuration of the imaging equipment (mentioned in the Forbes article). This could potentially result in physical harm to patients if radiation doses are modified.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The advisory states that the vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The Forbes article also mentions that hospital systems may be accessible over the web, which could be used to access the vulnerable systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the affected systems. This could be achieved by:
    *   Gaining access to the hospital's internal network.
    *   Accessing systems that are exposed to the internet.
*   **Low Skill Level:**  The ICS advisory states that an attacker with a low skill level would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory lists multiple other CVEs affecting different GE Healthcare products related to the same root cause (default/hard-coded credentials).
*   The Forbes article provides a good overview of the impact of this type of vulnerability in medical devices, including potential for data theft and manipulation of the systems, potentially causing physical harm.
*   GEâ€™s response, as mentioned in the Forbes article, was to state that the passwords should be changed. However, the researcher also mentioned that in some cases the documentation asked users not to change the default passwords.
*   The ICS-CERT advisory provides detailed mitigation steps, including closing unused ports, limiting third-party software, ensuring updates are applied, restricting network access and monitoring for suspicious activity.
