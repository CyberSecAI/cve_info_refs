Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6505:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `id` parameter in the `get_hours.php` page of PHP Volunteer Management version 1.0.2 is vulnerable to both Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The application also fails to sanitize user-provided data in the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by other users, leading to potential session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary code on the database server, thus compromising the integrity and confidentiality of the data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited via HTTP requests by directly manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL when accessing the `get_hours.php` script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   No authentication is required for exploitation.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Summary of Exploit Details:**

The `exploit-db` entry provides proof-of-concept (PoC) URLs demonstrating the XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
* **XSS PoC:**
`http://localhost/mods/hours/data/get_hours.php?id=%27%22%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29;%3C/script%3E&take=10&skip=0&page=1&pageSize=10`
This URL demonstrates how an attacker can inject a simple JavaScript alert using the `id` parameter, confirming the XSS vulnerability.
* **SQL Injection PoC:**
`http://localhost/mods/hours/data/get_hours.php?id=1%27%20AND%20SLEEP%285%29%20AND%20%27BDzu%27=%27BDzu&take=10&skip=0&page=1&pageSize=10`
This URL shows an SQL injection using `SLEEP(5)`, which will cause a delay in server response, thus confirming the presence of the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The application is identified as "PHP Volunteer Management" version 1.0.2.
*   The vulnerabilities are present in the `get_hours.php` page within the `/mods/hours/data/` directory.
*   The exploit was published on 2012-04-26.

This entry from exploit-db provides more details than the initial CVE description, detailing specific attack vectors and proof of concepts for both XSS and SQL injection.
