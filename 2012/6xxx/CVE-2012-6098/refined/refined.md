Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a capability issue in Moodle's outcome editing functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Capability Checks:** The system failed to properly check user capabilities when editing outcomes. This allowed users, specifically teachers, who lacked the necessary permissions to elevate custom outcomes to standard, site-wide outcomes during the editing process.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Teachers could improperly elevate the status of a custom created outcome to standard, which would normally require higher level permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Modification of Site-Wide Settings:** A teacher could make a custom outcome a standard site-wide outcome, potentially affecting the site-wide grading or assessment standards/outcomes defined for the Moodle instance. Although described as a "minor" issue, it allows for unintended changes to site-wide configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Manipulation through User Interface:** The attack vector is through the standard user interface used for editing outcomes. A teacher with access to this interface could exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Teacher Role:** The attacker needs to have a teacher role in the Moodle instance to access the outcome editing interface.
*   **Access to Outcome Editing:** The teacher must have access to edit an outcome they created.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is marked as "minor" in severity.
*   The issue was reported by Elena Ivanov.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Moodle versions including 2.4, 2.3 to 2.3.3+, 2.2 to 2.2.6+, 2.1 to 2.1.9+, and 1.9 to 1.9.19.
*   The fix involved preventing teachers from improperly setting custom outcomes to standard during the editing of that outcome.
