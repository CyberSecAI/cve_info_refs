Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6651:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability within the "vitamin" WordPress plugin. This vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of the 'path' parameter received via HTTP GET requests in `add_headers.php` and `minify.php` files. Specifically, the plugin directly uses the provided path to construct file paths without proper validation, allowing an attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization for the 'path' parameter. The code uses `$_GET['path']` without sufficient checks, allowing an attacker to insert directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access arbitrary files on the server.
- **Insecure File Inclusion:**  The files `add_headers.php` and `minify.php`  use user-supplied input directly in file paths for inclusion and/or processing. While there is an attempted fix to prevent php/phtml inclusion, the underlying path traversal is still exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Access:** By exploiting the path traversal, an attacker can access any file on the server that the webserver user has read permissions to. This includes sensitive files like configuration files, database credentials, and other application code. The impact is severe, as it can lead to data breaches, privilege escalation, and complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request where the `path` parameter is manipulated to include directory traversal sequences. The `add_headers.php` and `minify.php` files are vulnerable to this attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress plugin. This typically means they need to have network connectivity to the server running the website.
- **Knowledge of Plugin Structure:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable files (`add_headers.php` and `minify.php`) within the plugin directory to send the crafted request to those specific files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in version 1.0 of the Vitamin plugin and was fixed in version 1.1.
- The fix included checks for `../` sequences in the path and file extension validation to prevent access to php and phtml files.
- The vulnerability was identified as a "Big security issue" by the plugin developers and prompted the release of version 1.1 as a fix.

In summary, the vulnerability is a path traversal issue stemming from inadequate input validation, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server. The fix included both directory traversal detection and file extension checks to try to mitigate the vulnerability.
