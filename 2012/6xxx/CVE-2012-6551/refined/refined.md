{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The default configuration of Apache ActiveMQ before 5.8.0 includes a sample web application that is vulnerable to resource exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The sample web application does not implement resource limitations, allowing arbitrary requests to consume all available broker resources.",
      "The sample web application is enabled by default."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending HTTP requests to the sample web application, leading to broker resource consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to the vulnerable sample web application."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where Apache ActiveMQ is running."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The vulnerability was fixed in Apache ActiveMQ 5.8.0 by disabling the sample web application by default. Instructions were provided on how to start the broker with an activemq-demo.xml file for those who want the sample application running."
