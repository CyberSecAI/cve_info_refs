* **Status:**
  Resolved
* **Priority:**
  ![](/jira/images/icons/priorities/minor.svg "Minor - Minor loss of function, or other problem where easy workaround is present.") Minor
* **Resolution:**
  Fixed
* **Affects Version/s:**
  5.7.0
* **Fix Version/s:**
  [5.8.0](/jira/issues/?jql=project+%3D+AMQ+AND+fixVersion+%3D+5.8.0 "5.8.0 Maintenance release with new AMQP support and smaller modules")
* **Component/s:**

* **Labels:**
  None
#### Description

The out of the box broker you can start with bin/activemq includes a sample web application. We should disable this web app as people dont want to run this in the production broker. Instead we should have instructions to startup the broker with a activemq-demo.xml file that has the sample instead.

RHSA-2013:1029 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2013:1029 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1, which fixes multiple security
issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Fuse MQ Enterprise, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant
messaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.

This release of Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1 is an update to
Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 and includes bug fixes. Refer to the readme file
included with the patch files for information about the bug fixes.

The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

It was found that, by default, the Apache ActiveMQ web console did not
require authentication. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the
state of the Apache ActiveMQ environment, obtain sensitive information, or
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2013-3060)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the Apache ActiveMQ
demo web applications. A remote attacker could use these flaws to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML on pages displayed by the demo web
applications. (CVE-2012-6092)

It was found that a sample Apache ActiveMQ application was deployed by
default. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send the sample
application requests, allowing them to consume all available broker
resources. (CVE-2012-6551)

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way Apache
ActiveMQ handled cron jobs. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
perform an XSS attack against users viewing the scheduled.jsp page.
(CVE-2013-1879)

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the
portfolioPublish servlet of the Apache ActiveMQ demo web applications. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary web script or
HTML. (CVE-2013-1880)

Note: All of the above flaws only affected the distribution of Apache
ActiveMQ included in the extras directory of the Fuse MQ Enterprise
distribution. The Fuse MQ Enterprise product itself was not affected by any
of the above flaws.

The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name
in /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
custom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these
native libraries with malicious versions during the window between when
HawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)

The CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat
Product Security Team.

All users of Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 as provided from the Red Hat Customer
Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 roll up patch 1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=955908#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2013-04-24 04:23:25 UTC  ``` The web console in Apache ActiveMQ before 5.8.0 does not require authentication. Remote attackers could use this flaw to modify the state of the ActiveMQ environment, obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service via HTTP requests.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=955908#c1)  David Jorm    2013-04-26 05:11:07 UTC  ``` External References:  (none)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=955908#c3)  David Jorm    2013-04-26 05:26:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0, Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.1, JBoss Fuse 6.0.0 and JBoss A-MQ 6.0.0 all contain the Apache ActiveMQ web console, but it is not deployed by default. The documentation for deploying the web console covers the configuration needed to ensure authentication is enabled, therefore these products are not affected by this flaw. In a future update to these products, the web console will be configured so that authentication is automatically enabled if the web console is deployed, eliminating the need to manually configure it.  A future update may address this flaw in Fuse Message Broker 5.5.1.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=955908#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-07-09 17:57:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0  Via RHSA-2013:1029 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1029.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=955908#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-09-09 16:57:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Fuse Message Broker 5.5.1  Via RHSA-2013:1221 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1221.html>   ``` |  |
