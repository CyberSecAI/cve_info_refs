{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Rack parses the Content-Disposition header, specifically when handling unquoted filenames. The regular expressions used to parse the header were not robust enough to handle very long, unquoted filenames, leading to performance issues and a potential Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
       "Inadequate regular expressions",
       "DoS vulnerability due to inefficient parsing"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service against applications using rubygem-rack. By sending crafted multipart requests with excessively long, unquoted filenames in the Content-Disposition header, an attacker could cause the server to consume excessive resources, potentially leading to service disruption or crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests containing multipart/form-data with a crafted Content-Disposition header.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server utilizing the vulnerable Rack version. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability."
  },
  "patches": [
    {
      "commit_id": "c9f65df37a151821eb88ddd1dc404b83e52c52d5",
      "description": "Fix parsing performance for unquoted filenames. This patch modifies the regular expressions used in Rack::Multipart to correctly parse filenames and avoid performance problems when handling unquoted filenames that are excessively long.",
        "changes": [
            "Modified regex to correctly parse unquoted filenames in the Content-Disposition header",
             "Added a test case that parses very long unquoted multipart file names to prevent regressions."
