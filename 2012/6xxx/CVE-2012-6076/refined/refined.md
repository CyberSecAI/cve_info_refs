Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-6076:

- **Vulnerability:** Inkscape reads .eps files from `/tmp` instead of the current directory.
- **Root Cause:** When opening a .eps file, Inkscape changes the current working directory to `/tmp` before running `ps2pdf` on the argument. This is done because "ps2pdf may attempt to write to the current directory, which may not be writeable, so we switch to the temp directory first." The application was changing directory to `/tmp` and processing files from there instead of the current working directory.
- **Attack Vector:** A local attacker can trick a user into opening a different file than the one that was intended by placing a malicious file with the same name in `/tmp`. An unsuspecting user opens `file.eps` in their current directory but Inkscape opens `/tmp/file.eps` instead.
- **Impact:**
  - A user may open a file belonging to another user from `/tmp`, which could contain incorrect data or offensive content.
  - A symbolic link in `/tmp` could point to a protected file of the user, leading to unintended disclosure.
  - A symbolic link could point to a special file (e.g., `/proc/<pid>/fd/0`), causing the linked program to behave incorrectly.
  - A user might be tricked into saving the open file and lose data by overwriting the file in the current directory with the content found in the `/tmp` file.
- **Affected Versions:** Inkscape versions prior to 0.48.4 are vulnerable.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that relative file names are expanded to absolute paths before being passed to external scripts (specifically, the Python script used to import EPS files).  Michael Karcher provided a patch that relies on GLib for testing for relative pathnames and building an absolute one.

The vulnerability exists because inkscape changes the working directory to `/tmp` before processing the file, and doesn't properly resolve relative paths to the intended current working directory. This allows an attacker to potentially influence which file is processed.
