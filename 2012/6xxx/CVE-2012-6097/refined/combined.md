| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=893661#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-09 15:58:17 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that cronie would leak certain fd's.  On systems where /etc/crontab is not world-readable this could be an information disclosure concern.  This was introduced upstream in cronie 1.4.8 [3] and fixed in 1.4.9 [4], so the only version of cronie that is affected by this issue is 1.4.8.  It was also patched in Fedora via cronie-1.4.8-2.fc15 (see [2] for those details).  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=786096> [2] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=717505](show_bug.cgi?id=717505 "CLOSED ERRATA - SELinux is preventing /usr/sbin/logrotate from 'read' accesses on the directory /var/spool/cron.") [3] <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/cronie.git/commit/src/cron.c?id=acdf4ae8456888ed78201906ef528f4c28f54582> [4] <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/cronie.git/commit/src/cron.c?id=b19007ca9fddd62ecef3af4a7d2d252f1d5e0419>   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of cronie as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8652#c0)  Oden Eriksson    2013-01-11 06:25:56 CET  ``` <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=893661>  "Vincent Danen 2013-01-09 10:58:17 EST  It was reported [1],[2] that cronie would leak certain fd's.  On systems where /etc/crontab is not world-readable this could be an information disclosure concern.  This was introduced upstream in cronie 1.4.8 [3] and fixed in 1.4.9 [4], so the only version of cronie that is affected by this issue is 1.4.8.  It was also patched in Fedora via cronie-1.4.8-2.fc15 (see [2] for those details).  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=786096> [2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=717505> [3] <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/cronie.git/commit/src/cron.c?id=acdf4ae8456888ed78201906ef528f4c28f54582> [4] <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/cronie.git/commit/src/cron.c?id=b19007ca9fddd62ecef3af4a7d2d252f1d5e0419>   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of cronie as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6." ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=8652#c1)  Oden Eriksson    2013-01-11 06:27:18 CET  ``` Fixed in r345483 (mga2, updates_testing, cronie-1.4.8-5.1.mga2) ```  Manuel Hiebel    2013-01-11 22:23:39 CET   Hardware: i586 => AllAssignee: bugsquad => qa-bugsSource RPM: (none) => cronie-1.4.8-5.1.mga2.src.rpm  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=8652#c2)  claire robinson    2013-01-14 15:59:06 CET  ``` Can you give a Mageia advisory please Oden. Thanks.  SRPM: cronie-1.4.8-5.1.mga2.src.rpm ----------------------------------- cronie-anacron cronie cronie-debug ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=8652#c3)  David Walser    2013-01-16 22:17:13 CET  ``` This is an extremely low-impact vulnerability, and would only affect systems where /etc/crontab wasn't world readable (as is the case in the msec secure level, for instance) and the sysadmin has made local modifications to the /etc/crontab file itself, and doesn't want users on the system to know about it.  This sounds unlikely to affect anybody IMO.  Here's the advisory text:  It was reported that cronie 1.4.8 would leak certain file descriptors.  On systems where /etc/crontab is not world-readable this could be an information disclosure concern (CVE-2012-6097).
