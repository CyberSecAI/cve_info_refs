Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a file descriptor (fd) leak in the `cronie` software, specifically version 1.4.8.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The cronie daemon does not properly close file descriptors after use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: On systems where `/etc/crontab` is not world-readable, a user may potentially gain access to the contents of this file. This is because the leaked file descriptor could point to a file that the user should not have access to.
- The impact is considered low.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker would need to be a user on the system.
- The attacker would likely need to execute a cron job which triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must be a local user on the system.
- Must be able to execute cron jobs (which they typically can as a user).
- Access to non-world-readable `/etc/crontab` is required for the info leak impact.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in `cronie` version 1.4.8.
- The issue was introduced in cronie 1.4.8 and fixed in 1.4.9.
- A patch was also provided for Fedora via cronie-1.4.8-2.fc15.
- The Red Hat bug report states that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was not vulnerable.
- Mageia also patched this vulnerability.
