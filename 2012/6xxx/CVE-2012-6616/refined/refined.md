Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-6616:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content includes a ticket related to a crash in the `mov_text` decoder within FFmpeg, identified by ticket number #2087.
   - The ticket mentions a "Segmentation fault" (SIGSEGV) when decoding mov_text subtitles in a specific .mkv file.
   - While the CVE description is missing, the context suggests a potential heap-based buffer overflow or related issue in the `mov_text` decoder, which is often found in subtitle processing and can cause crashes. This aligns with known vulnerability patterns in multimedia processing. Therefore, it is relevant.

**2. Vulnerability Information:**

   - **Root Cause:** The crash occurs within the `text_to_ass` function in `libavcodec/movtextdec.c`, specifically when accessing the `*text` pointer at line 32. The memory addresses pointed to by `text` and `text_end` are out of bounds, indicating a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read issue within `mov_text_decode_frame` function.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
     - **Out-of-Bounds Read/Write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read during the decoding process within the `text_to_ass` function, probably due to a malformed or crafted subtitle text buffer. It is highly probable that the length check or input parsing within `mov_text_decode_frame` is incorrect.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
     - **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash in FFmpeg, which results in abnormal termination.
     - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeated crashes could lead to a denial-of-service condition if an attacker could repeatedly provide the malicious input.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - **Malicious Media File:** The attack vector is a crafted .mkv file containing malicious `mov_text` subtitle data. This file would need to be processed by a vulnerable version of FFmpeg.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted .mkv file as input to FFmpeg. This could involve tricking a user into playing the file, serving it through a video streaming service, etc.
     - No special privileges are needed.

**3. Technical Details:**

   - The crash occurs within the `text_to_ass` function called by `mov_text_decode_frame`.
   - The affected code is within `libavcodec/movtextdec.c`.
   - The input file is described as `'702121h264-TTA.mkvtest82.mkv'`.
   - The backtrace from the crash using `gdb` provides the function call stack that leads to the crash in `text_to_ass`.
   - The vulnerability is reproduced by the developer (`Reproduced by developer: yes`).
   - The vulnerability is fixed in commit `7d66bc792`.

**4. Additional Notes:**

   - The content from secunia.com doesn't provide any specific information about CVE-2012-6616, only general information about Secunia Research team.
   - The content from www.ffmpeg.org gives a log of several vulnerabilities with a specific commit that fixes them. However, there is no CVE-2012-6616 mentioned anywhere.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read within the `mov_text` subtitle decoder in FFmpeg. An attacker can craft a malicious .mkv file with specially crafted subtitle data that causes a segmentation fault. This leads to a crash and potential denial of service when FFmpeg tries to process the malicious file.
