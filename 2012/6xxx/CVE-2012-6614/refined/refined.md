{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The D-Link DSR-250N router has a hidden backdoor user with a known username (ZX4q9Q9JUpwTZuo7).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The router allows modification of user accounts via the CLI, including the ability to change the password of the backdoor user. The router uses a weak DES-Crypt hash for password storage after the password is changed, which simplifies brute-force attacks",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with admin access to the CLI can gain persistent root access by changing the password of the backdoor user, logging in with the backdoor account, and obtaining a root shell. The attacker can then perform arbitrary operations on the system. This also bypasses the intended restriction to the CLI interface.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited via SSH using a valid admin account to log in to the CLI.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs administrative access to the router's CLI via SSH using valid credentials (default: admin/admin).  After obtaining CLI access, the attacker can then leverage the vulnerability."
