Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6497:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Authlogic gem for Ruby on Rails, when used with certain versions before 3.2.10, makes potentially unsafe `find_by_id` method calls. This vulnerability is linked to the SQL injection issue described in CVE-2012-6496.
*   The vulnerability arises when `find_by_id` is used in a way that allows for the injection of SQL commands when provided with crafted parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Specifically, the use of `find_by_id` within the Authlogic gem might be vulnerable if the input to `find_by_id` method calls is not sanitized properly or if the application does not expect specific data types.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL command execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, which can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Parameters:** The vulnerability is exploited through crafted parameters within a request to a Ruby on Rails application. This could involve manipulating parameters passed to `find_by_id` calls.
*   **Known Secret Token:** Exploitation is facilitated when a known `secret_token` value is available, as demonstrated by the value contained in `secret_token.rb` in an open-source product.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Code:** The attacker would likely need to know that the `find_by_id` method is being used in a vulnerable way within the Authlogic gem and how to exploit it using crafted parameters.
*   **Potentially Knowledge of Secret Token**: The attacker could benefit from knowing the application's `secret_token` value, although this isn't strictly required for exploitation, it could ease the process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This CVE is linked to CVE-2012-6496, which addresses a broader SQL injection vulnerability in Ruby on Rails itself. CVE-2012-6497 is more specific to the Authlogic gem.
*   The vulnerability is more likely to be relevant to sites that, for some reason, are staying at Ruby on Rails version 3.2.9 for now.
