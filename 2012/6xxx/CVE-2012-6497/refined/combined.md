Subject: Re: SQL Injection Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails (CVE-2012-5664)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Repurposing CVE-2012-5664 to match the official advisory from the Ruby
on Rails core team is problematic because that would change the
affected product. Many CVE consumers have processes for using CVE that
can't cleanly handle all arbitrary types of post-publication changes
to the affected product. In this situation, taking a published CVE and
changing the affected product from "the Authlogic gem" to "Ruby on
Rails" is not something that we'd like to do.

The official advisory, i.e.,

  <https://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/msg/23daa048baf28b64?dmode=source&output=gplain>

is obviously an important vendor disclosure about an important
product, and there will be a CVE entry that corresponds to this vendor
disclosure. See below.

Our understanding is that some details of the Authlogic gem do have
security concerns for some people. These are perhaps alluded to by
"The injection interfaces are documented and the programmer is not
supposed to pass user input to those interfaces" and subsequent
statements in the

  <http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/01/03/rails-sql-injection-vulnerability-hold-your-horses-here-are-the-facts/>

post. This may be mostly relevant at sites that, for whatever reason,
are staying at 3.2.9 for now. In any case, tracking an Authlogic gem
issue may be worthwhile for some CVE consumers. It may meet our
definition of a vulnerability even if it doesn't meet your definition
of a vulnerability. A maintainer of the Authlogic gem is, of course,
welcome to dispute this, and the related entry (see below) would then
be marked as "DISPUTED" in CVE.

The outcome we're planning will be similar to this draft content:

CVE-2012-5664

** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.  ConsultIDs:
CVE-2012-6496, CVE-2012-6497.  Reason: this candidate was intended for
one issue, but the candidate was publicly used to label concerns about
multiple products.  Notes: All CVE users should consult CVE-2012-6496
and CVE-2012-6497 to determine which ID is appropriate.  All
references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to
prevent accidental usage.

CVE-2012-6496

MLIST:[rubyonrails-security] 20130102 SQL Injection Vulnerability in Ruby on Rails (CVE-2012-5664)
<https://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/msg/23daa048baf28b64?dmode=source&output=gplain>

MISC:<http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/01/03/rails-sql-injection-vulnerability-hold-your-horses-here-are-the-facts/>

SQL injection vulnerability in the Active Record component in Ruby on
Rails before 3.0.18, 3.1.x before 3.1.9, and 3.2.x before 3.2.10
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a
crafted request that leverages incorrect behavior of dynamic finders
in applications that can use unexpected data types in certain find_by_
method calls.

CVE-2012-6497

MISC:<http://phenoelit.org/blog/archives/2012/12/21/let_me_github_that_for_you/index.html>
MISC:<http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/01/03/rails-sql-injection-vulnerability-hold-your-horses-here-are-the-facts/>

The Authlogic gem for Ruby on Rails, when used with certain versions
before 3.2.10, makes potentially unsafe find_by_id method calls, which
might allow remote attackers to conduct CVE-2012-6496 SQL injection
attacks via a crafted parameter in environments that have a known
secret_token value, as demonstrated by a value contained in
secret_token.rb in an open-source product.
