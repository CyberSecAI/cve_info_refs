# 0day DoS: Mikrotik Server side DoS attack

¬† By [PoURaN](https://133tsec.com/author/pouran/ "View all posts by PoURaN") |  [April 30, 2012  - 12:24 pm](https://133tsec.com/2012/04/0day-ddos-mikrotik-server-side-ddos-attack/ "12:24 pm") |   [Exploit Dev/Reverse Engineering](https://133tsec.com/category/exploit-devreverse-engineering/)

**Intro..**

After exploring the winbox clientserver protocol, i wanted to find some ways to get rid of winbox service and winbox client‚Ä¶

This finding, has to do only with the mikrotik router, who has winbox service running (on port 8291 or in any other port)

On my try to make a test on the server, in order to cause a lot of traffic, i saw the service being unstable, causing various probs to whole router. The minimum prob was the 100% cpu load, but there are various probs depending on hardware and routeros version. The exploit‚Äôs logic is very simple, and the winbox protocol analysis is simple too.So it made me identify that vulnerability very easy. The vulnerability found while trying to download a DLL/plugin file from mikrotik router (just like winbox client does) and choose a big file, and request the 1st part of it many times.. That is what causes the DoS. The only file needed here is the .py script, and it is tested on python 2.4 and 2.7 versions.

More details, download and usage, are below.. :

**Vulnerability Description**

 **===========================**

The denial of service, happens on mikrotik router‚Äôs winbox service when

the attacker is requesting continuesly a part of a .dll/plugin file, so the service

becomes unstable causing every remote clients (with winbox) to disconnect

and denies to accept any further connections. That happens for about 5 minutes. After

the 5 minutes, winbox is stable again, being able to accept new connections.

If you send the malicious packet in a loop (requesting part of a file right after

the service becoming available again) then you result in a 100% denial of winbox service.

While the winbox service is unstable and in a denial to serve state, it raises router‚Äôs CPU 100%

and other actions. The ‚Äúother actions‚Äù depends on the router version and on the hardware.

For example on Mikrotik Router v3.30 there was a LAN corruption, BGP fail, whole router failure

=> Mikrotik Router v2.9.6 there was a BGP failure

=> Mikrotik Router v4.13 unstable wifi links

=> Mikrotik Router v5.14/5.15 rarely stacking

=>>> Behaviour may vary most times, but ALL will have CPU 100% . Most routers loose BGP after long time attack <<

**The exploit**

 **=============**

This is a vulnerability in winbox service, exploiting the fact that winbox lets you download files/plugins

that winbox client needs to control the server, and generally lets you gain basic infos about the service BEFORE

user login!

Sending requests specially crafted for the winbox service, can cause a 100% denial of winbox service (router side).

This script, offers you the possibility to download any of the dlls that can be downloaded from the router one-by-one

or alltogether! (look usage for more info) .. The file must be contained in the router‚Äôs dll index.

The dlls downloaded, are in the format of the winbox service.. Meaning that they are compressed with gzip and they

have 0xFFFF bytes every 0x101 bytes (the format that winbox client is expecting the files)

These DLLs can be used by the ‚ÄúWinbox remote code execution‚Äù exploit script üòâ

> **Download script here: [mkDl](https://133tsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/mkDl.zip "Mikrotik Downloader")**

**Usage**

 **=======**

Try running the script without arguments to see usage.. or

Use the script as described below:

 **1. You can download ALL the files of the router‚Äôs dll index using the following command:**

> python mkDl.py 10.0.0.1 \* 1

the ‚Äú1‚Äù in the end, is the speed.. ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù is a factor I added, so the script delays a bit while receiving

information from the server. It is a MUST for remote routers when they are in long distance (many hops) to use

a slower speed ( 9 for example ).

Also in the beginning of the dlls file list, script shows you the router‚Äôs version (provided by router‚Äôs index)

 **2. You can download a specific .dll file from the remote router.**

> python mkDl.py 10.67.162.1 roteros.dll 1

In this example i download roteros.dll (which is the biggest and main plugin) with a speed factor of 1 (very fast)

Because roteros and 1-2 other files are big, you have to request them in different part (parts of 64k each)

That is a restriction of winbox communication protocol.

If you don‚Äôt know which file to request, make a ‚Äú\*‚Äù request first (1st usage example), see the dlls list, and press ctrl-c

to stop the script.

 **3. You can cause a Denial Of Service to the remote router.. Means denial in winbox service or more (read above for more)**

> python mkDl.py 10.67.162.1 DoS

This command starts requesting from router‚Äôs winbox service the 1st part of roteros.dll looping the request

and causing DoS to the router. The script is requesting the file till the router stops responding to the port (8291).

Then it waits till the service is up again (using some exception handling), then it requests again till the remote service is down again etc etc‚Ä¶ The requests lasts for about 2 seconds, and the router is not responding for about 5 minutes as far as i have seen from my tests in different routeros versions.

   PoURaN~

   This is confirmed fixed on my box now. Also for your list‚Ä¶. this absolutely kills the winbox service on my 493G/ROS 5.5 however I saw no depreciable change in traffic flow.

   I tested my traffic flow by SCPing a large file from my laptop (LAN SIDE) to a server on the WAN side of the Mikrotik.

   However you could lock admins out‚Ä¶ I know plenty of people who would be lost without WinBox.

    you don‚Äôt need to.. they are the original DLLs as they are provided by mikrotik router v5.14.. If you wanna see them you have to remove the two 0xFF 0xFF bytes in every 0x101 bytes inside every DLL.. (that‚Äôs the format, that winbox wants to ‚Äúsee‚Äù the receiving file) if you see the script‚Äôs source you‚Äôll find out.. üòâ

      no you can‚Äôt do it with this method.. and inside dll there is no info like that.. You can just grab the admin‚Äôs saved winbox passwords (if there are any) using the command execution exploit and a mac spoofing method BUT you must be in the same Lan as the victim OR you can social him, so you don‚Äôt need same lan and mac sppofing ‚Ä¶ üòõ

    thanks PoURaN for this great info i don‚Äôt think that i will find it any where and i have 3 questions :

    1st how can i get the backup of mikrotik or the other info like user name isn‚Äôt the dll files that we downloaded contain all the infos?

    2nd how do i use the dll files to extract the info on it like ppp and any others.

    3rd.what mac do i have to spoof the admin pc lan or the mikrotik or any one on who connected to the mikrotic.

    [@hi](#comment-176)

    Hello, concerning your questions:

    1) no you can‚Äôt.. and no the DLLs don‚Äôt contain any infos about users/backups.. they just contain functions in order to make winbox.exe work for the specific mikrotik version.

    2) you can‚Äôt.. look 1) :p

    3) mac spoofing can be done where you are in the same LAN with your victim (in this case your victim is the mikrotik admin).. search more about mac spoofing..

    thanks PoURaN again for ur answering

    you said ‚ÄúYou can just grab the admin‚Äôs saved winbox passwords (if there are any) using the command execution exploit and a mac spoofing method ‚Äù

    i know how to spoof the mac address but what do u mean about command execution exploit what is this and can u tell me in details because it‚Äôs almost a year and iam trying how to hack the mikrotik to get the user and pass üôÇ

    Hey man.. I was a bit busy that‚Äôs why I was late in reply.. So.. By saying remote code execution exploit, I mean this one.. <http://www.133tsec.com/2012/04/27/0day-mikrotik-winbox-client-side-attack-a-remote-code-execution-exploit/>

    Watch and understand the video I made there.. To execute code to your victim, you have to do it 1) even by social.. (talk to him and ask him to connect to yor malicious mtik emulator) 2) by spoofing his router and force him to connect to you instead of his router (mac spoofing ‚Äì same LAN)

    For how to make a malicious emulator for mtik watch the vid of the exploit i told you earlier..

    cya

    I think is a goood ideea to write a script that is honeyspot for mikrotik to collect user/pass and the spoof router`s mac.

    Hi there

    I was wondering on how to create a custom dll that winbox would download and that it would show me the welcome screen for instance

    as I was always fascinated on how routeros.dll for instance shapes the way winbox looks like for the fist test, just this would be enough: [https://www.qtechsystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/winbox-Login-1024√ó616.png](https://www.qtechsystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/winbox-Login-1024x616.png)

    but I am not realy sure how theese dlls are constructed, when opening them with ghidra for instance (awesome decompiler): <https://ghidra-sre.org/>

    it is not able to identify anything not even DLLMain

    so if you have already played around with that and maybe have some source for some example dll that winbox would load, let me know

    Thanks for Anwsering and Best Regards

# Exploit Title: 	Mikrotik Router Remote Denial Of Service attack
# Date: 			19/4/2012
# Author: 			PoURaN @ 133tsec.com
# Software Link: 	http://www.mikrotik.com
# Version: 			All mikrotik routers with winbox service enabled are affected (still a 0day 30/5/2012)
# Tested on: 		Mikrotis RouterOS 2.9.6 up to 5.15
#
#  Vulnerability Description
# ===========================
# DETAILS & PoC VIDEO : http://www.133tsec.com/2012/04/30/0day-ddos-mikrotik-server-side-ddos-attack/
# The denial of service, happens on mikrotik router's winbox service when
# the attacker is requesting continuesly a part of a .dll/plugin file, so the service
# becomes unstable causing every remote clients (with winbox) to disconnect
# and denies to accept any further connections. That happens for about 5 minutes. After
# the 5 minutes, winbox is stable again, being able to accept new connections.
# If you send the malicious packet in a loop (requesting  part of a file right after
# the service becoming available again) then you result in a 100% denial of winbox service.
# While the winbox service is unstable and in a denial to serve state, it raises router's CPU 100%
# and other actions. The "other actions" depends on the router version and on the hardware.
# For example on Mikrotik Router v3.30 there was a LAN corruption, BGP fail, whole router failure
# 	=> Mikrotik Router v2.9.6 there was a BGP failure
#	=> Mikrotik Router v4.13 unstable wifi links
#	=> Mikrotik Router v5.14/5.15 rarely stacking
#	=>>> Behaviour may vary most times, but ALL will have CPU 100% . Most routers loose BGP after long time attack <<<=
#
#
#  The exploit
# =============
# This is a vulnerability in winbox service, exploiting the fact that winbox lets you download files/plugins
# that winbox client needs to control the server, and generally lets you gain basic infos about the service BEFORE
# user login!
# Sending requests specially crafted for the winbox service, can cause a 100% denial of winbox service (router side).
# This script, offers you the possibility to download any of the dlls that can be downloaded from the router one-by-one
# or alltogether! (look usage for more info) .. The file must be contained in the router's dll index.
# The dlls downloaded, are in the format of the winbox service.. Meaning that they are compressed with gzip and they
# have 0xFFFF bytes every 0x101 bytes (the format that winbox client is expecting the files)
# These DLLs can be used by the "Winbox remote code execution" exploit script ;)
#
#  Usage
# =======
# Use the script as described below:
# 1. You can download ALL the files of the router's dll index using the following command:
#	python mkDl.py 10.0.0.1 * 1
#	the "1" in the end, is the speed.. "Speed" is a factor I added, so the script delays a bit while receiving
#	information from the server. It is a MUST for remote routers when they are in long distance (many hops) to use
#	a slower speed ( 9 for example ).
#	Also in the beginning of the dlls file list, script shows you the router's version (provided by router's index)
# 2. You can download a specific .dll file from the remote router.
#	python mkDl.py 10.67.162.1 roteros.dll 1
#	In this example i download roteros.dll (which is the biggest and main plugin) with a speed factor of 1 (very fast)
#	Because roteros and 1-2 other files are big, you have to request them in different part (parts of 64k each)
#	That is a restriction of winbox communication protocol.
#	If you don't know which file to request, make a "*" request first (1st usage example), see the dlls list, and press ctrl-c
#	to stop the script.
# 3. You can cause a Denial Of Service to the remote router.. Means denial in winbox service or more (read above for more)
#	python mkDl.py 10.67.162.1 DoS
#	This command starts requesting from router's winbox service the 1st part of roteros.dll looping the request
#	and causing DoS to the router. The script is requesting the file till the router stops responding to the port (8291)
#	Then it waits till the service is up again (using some exception handling), then it requests again till the remote
#	service is down again etc etc... The requests lasts for about 2 seconds, and the router is not responding for about
#	5 minutes as far as i have seen from my tests in different routeros versions.

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
