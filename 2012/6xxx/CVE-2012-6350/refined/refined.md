- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Cognos TM1 Web component is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where maliciously crafted JavaScript or HTML could be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities within the context of the user's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the TM1 Web component, which is part of the IBM Cognos TM1 suite, using malicious javascript or HTML.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the TM1 web component to exploit the vulnerability, which suggests they need to have a position where they can influence or manipulate data that will be processed by the TM1 web component. This also includes tricking the user to click on a link containing the malicious javascript or HTML.
