        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the misuse of the libcurl API within falconpl. Specifically, the `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` option is treated as a boolean, using only values 0 and 1, when it actually accepts three values (0, 1, and 2).",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code incorrectly sets the `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` option to either 0 or 1 based on a boolean. Setting the value to '0' disables host verification, while setting it to '1' does not enforce proper host verification, making the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where a malicious actor could impersonate a legitimate server.",
