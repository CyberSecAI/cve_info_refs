{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect handling of micro transport protocol packets in Transmission's libutp library, specifically related to selective acknowledgements.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing selective acknowledgements in `UTPSocket::selective_ack`.",
    "The `resends` array on the stack had a hardcoded size limit of 32, while the number of packets to resend could exceed this limit, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "Lack of proper validation of extension length and ack mask size."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) of the Transmission daemon. There was also a risk of arbitrary code execution due to stack corruption from the buffer overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending specially crafted micro transport protocol packets with carefully constructed selective acknowledgements. This can be done remotely over the network."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable Transmission instance, typically by connecting to the Transmission service or being in the network path of the peer-to-peer connections. They do not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges. "
