{
  "CVE-2012-6607": {
    "status": "RELATED",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Augeas handled configuration files when updating them, specifically when the target directory was writable by a different user.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Augeas was susceptible to symlink attacks during file saving operations.",
        "Augeas was susceptible to mount point attacks."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could overwrite arbitrary files or leak information via a symbolic link or mount point attack.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Creating a symbolic link at the predictable temporary file location used by Augeas (PATH.augnew).",
        "Using a mount point to redirect file writes to an unintended location."
     ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs write access to the directory where Augeas is saving the configuration files. This could be achieved if the application using Augeas runs with elevated privileges (e.g., as root) but modifies files in a directory writable by a less privileged user."
