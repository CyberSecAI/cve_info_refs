Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-6695:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided text directly mentions CVE-2012-6695 as being assigned to GE Centricity PACS Server, which is one of the affected products. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of **default or hard-coded credentials** in various GE Healthcare products, including the Centricity PACS Server.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The systems rely on easily guessable default usernames and passwords. This lack of strong, unique credentials allows unauthorized access.
*   **Weak passwords**: Passwords were found to be short, lacked complexity, and consisted of easily guessable words. Examples include "insite" with password "2getin" and root account "root" with password "install."

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to the affected devices and systems, potentially including sensitive patient data.
*   **Data Theft:** Patient data, including personal information and medical images, stored on the devices could be stolen.
*   **System Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially change system configurations, including radiation dosing in imaging equipment, which presents a physical threat to patients by increasing the risk of cancer.
*   **Network Compromise:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in these devices can provide an entry point to the broader hospital network.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely via network access. This includes accessing the devices directly if they are exposed to the internet, or by gaining access to the hospital network.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill Level:** The article indicates that an attacker with a low skill level could exploit this vulnerability due to publicly available information and the simplicity of the credentials.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs some form of network access, either through direct internet exposure of the device or through access to the internal hospital network. The article mentions the use of the Shodan search tool to find exposed healthcare systems and vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that GE Healthcare provides updates on vulnerability management and other security information.
*   It also recommends that users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability.
*   The affected products are deployed across the Healthcare and Public Health sector.
*   The article highlights a broader issue of systemic security weaknesses in the medical technology industry.
*   The article mentions that a researcher found instances where GE documentation advised against changing default passwords as it could impact support services.

This information provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6695, as well as the broader implications of weak security in medical devices.
