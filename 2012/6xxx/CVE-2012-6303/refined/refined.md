{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `GetWavHeader()` function in `jkSoundFile.c` lacks boundary checks when parsing format sub-chunks or unknown sub-chunks within WAV files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user to open a specially crafted WAV file with an application using the vulnerable Snack library. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation through a crafted WAV file."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious WAV file that exploits the lack of bounds checking in the vulnerable `GetWavHeader()` function. The attacker also needs to convince a user to open the crafted file using a vulnerable application that utilizes the Snack library.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the parsing of format sub-chunks or unknown sub-chunks in WAV files within the `GetWavHeader()` function, and there are similar vulnerabilities present in other `Get*Header()` functions in `jkSoundFile.c`."
