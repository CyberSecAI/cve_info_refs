Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6649:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient admin verification in the `wp-gpx-maps_admin_tracks.php` file of the wp-gpx-maps WordPress plugin.  Specifically, the code did not properly validate file uploads, allowing potentially malicious files to be uploaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Inadequate File Type Validation:** The plugin failed to properly check the file type of uploaded files. It appears that while a regex for '.gpx' was present, it was not being used to validate uploaded files.
*   **Missing Admin Check:** The original file did not include a check to ensure that the user accessing the functionality was an administrator. This was added as part of the fix.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file (or another executable file), an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the WordPress website and the server it's hosted on.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** Attackers would exploit the file upload functionality within the admin panel of the WordPress plugin.
*   **Web Interface:** This attack would be performed via the plugin's administrative web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **WordPress Admin Access:** The attacker would need to have administrative access to the WordPress site. This could be achieved through compromised credentials or exploiting another vulnerability in the WordPress installation or its plugins.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved adding an `is_admin()` check and the proper validation of file extensions using the `$gpxRegEx`.
*   The changesets in the provided text highlight the addition of the new `wp-gpx-maps_admin_tracks.php` file in version 1.1.23 which includes the fix, as well as modifications to other files to reflect the version update.
*   The commit message in `readme.txt` and `wp-gpx-maps.php` indicate that this is a security fix, urging users to update.
