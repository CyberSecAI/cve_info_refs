Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-6707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the use of the `phpass` library in WordPress with its compatibility mode enabled by default, which uses a salted MD5 hash for password storage. MD5 is considered cryptographically weak and susceptible to brute-force attacks, especially with modern hardware. This is further exacerbated by the usage of a fixed salt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Weak Hashing Algorithm:** Using MD5, even with salting, is insecure due to its susceptibility to rainbow table attacks and fast brute-force cracking with modern GPU capabilities.
- **Compatibility Mode:** The compatibility mode in `phpass` forces the use of MD5, even when stronger algorithms are available.
- **No Native Hashing:**  WordPress did not utilize stronger native PHP hashing functions (like bcrypt available in PHP 5.3.7+ or password_hash in PHP 5.5+) for a long time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Compromised User Accounts:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts if they obtain the password hashes from the database.
- **Data Breaches:** If attackers gain access, they can potentially steal sensitive information, deface websites, or install malware.
- **Reputational Damage:** Compromised websites can damage the reputation of website owners and the WordPress platform.
- **Widespread Impact:** Due to WordPress's wide usage, this affects many websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Database Compromise:** An attacker would need to gain access to the database containing user password hashes. This could be through SQL injection, insecure hosting, or other vulnerabilities.
- **Offline Cracking:** Once the attacker obtains the password hashes, they can use specialized software (like oclHashcat) to brute-force crack the MD5 hashes offline.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** Though less likely given the context, theoretically a man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept login credentials, extract the password (given it's a weak hash), and log in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Database Access:** The attacker needs access to the WordPress database.
- **Password Cracking Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of password cracking techniques and tools to exploit the weak MD5 hashing.
- **Resource:** The attacker needs computational resources to perform password cracking (GPUs, FPGAs).

**Additional Information from the Content:**

-   **Proposed Solution:** The main proposed solution is to switch from `phpass` with the compatibility mode enabled (MD5) to bcrypt. This can be done either by using a filter to disable compatibility, a config constant, or by directly replacing the `PasswordHash` class calls. Eventually, a full switch to `password_hash()` was proposed.
-   **Backwards Compatibility Concerns:** There were extensive discussions about backwards compatibility issues, primarily regarding potential problems when moving sites from a server using a newer PHP version (bcrypt support) to an older one without it.
-   **Password Upgrading:** It was proposed to automatically re-hash user passwords to the new bcrypt algorithm when they log in.
-   **PHP Version Dependency:** The ticket also mentions the issue that PHP < 5.3.7 has a bug in its bcrypt implementation, and the compatibility library requires PHP 5.3.7+.
-   **72-Byte Limit:** The bcrypt algorithm truncates input passwords to 72 bytes. It's been discussed whether to truncate the password before hashing, pre-hash using SHA-2, or other measures.
-   **Argon2:** There's also been discussion about using Argon2 (available in PHP 7.2+) in the future for even stronger password hashing.
-   **Native PHP Functions:** Usage of `password_hash` and `password_verify` is preferred, instead of the older phpass library.
-   **Pluggable functions:**  It was mentioned that the relevant functions are pluggable, and a plugin could replace those functions entirely, although this is not the most user friendly way for most.
-   **Minimum PHP Version:** The minimum PHP version was a sticking point, and the difficulty of increasing it is a big reason why this ticket has existed for so long.
-   **Focus on User Experience:** It is a concern that any change should not be overly disruptive for end users, especially regarding migrations or server downgrades. An error message and password reset is considered the best approach for compatibility issues.
-  **Sodium and Libsodium**: There was a discussion about using functions from sodium\_compat, particularly `sodium_crypto_generichash`, and if there would be a fallback if the sodium extension was disabled.
- **OWASP Recommendation:** There was discussion around OWASP recommendation against pre-hashing passwords with bcrypt, and that this should be directly against bcrypt without pre-hashing.
-  **Application Passwords:** There were discussions about how application passwords are used in WordPress and the impact on XMLRPC and REST APIs, particularly the performance implications on the per request auth if strong hashing algorithms are used.
