    "root_cause": "The Chicken Scheme compiler before version 4.8.0 is susceptible to algorithmic complexity attacks related to hash table collisions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Algorithmic complexity vulnerability due to predictable hash table collisions.",
      "Inadequate dispersion in the hash implementation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by crafting input that leads to hash collisions, forcing the algorithm into its worst-case behavior (linear complexity). This can lead to excessive resource consumption and potentially crash the application.",

      "Network-based attacks",
      "Input manipulation"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the application that utilizes hash tables.",

    "Chicken Scheme Compiler before 4.8.0"

    "additional_notes": "The fix involves modifying the C functions to accept an extra 'seed' argument, and implementing a shift-add-xor hashing function, and moving the hashing algorithm to a single function to ease future experimentation."
