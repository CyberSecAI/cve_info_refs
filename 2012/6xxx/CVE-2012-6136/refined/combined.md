| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=918813#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 23:32:59 UTC  ``` Aaron Parsons reported [1] that tuned would create its PID file with insecure permissions (0666).  A local user could use this flaw to kill arbitrary running processes when the tuned service is stopped.  This was fixed upstream [2] and was also previously corrected in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHBA-2013:0386 [3].  Current Fedora 18 inherited the upstream fix, however Fedora 17 is still affected by this issue.   [1] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=845336](show_bug.cgi?id=845336 "CLOSED ERRATA - /var/run/tuned/tuned.pid created with insecure permissions") [2] <http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/tuned.git/commit/?h=1.0&id=9e8f670> [3] <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-0386.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=918813#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-06 23:39:20 UTC  ``` Created tuned tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-17 [[bug 918233](show_bug.cgi?id=918233 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-6136 CVE-2013-1820 tuned: multiple insecure permissions of pid files [fedora-17]")]   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.
