| |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | |  | [DjVu](http://www.djvuzone.org) is a web-centric format and software platform for distributing documents and images. DjVu can advantageously replace PDF, PS, TIFF, JPEG, and GIF for distributing scanned documents, digital documents, or high-resolution pictures. DjVu content downloads faster, displays and renders faster, looks nicer on a screen, and consume less client resources than competing formats. DjVu images display instantly and can be smoothly zoomed and panned with no lengthy re-rendering. DjVu is used by [hundreds of academic, commercial, governmental, and non-commercial web sites](http://www.djvuzone.org/links/index.html) around the world.

DjVu documents download and display extremely quickly, and look exactly the same on all platforms with no compatibility problems due to fonts, colors, etc. DjVu can be seen as a superior alternative to PDF and PostScript for digital documents, to TIFF (and PDF) for scanned bitonal documents, to JPEG and JPEG2000 for photographs and pictures, and to GIF for large palettized images. DjVu is the only Web format that is practical for distributing high-resolution scanned documents in color. No other format comes close. Typical DjVu file sizes are as follows:  * bitonal scanned documents: 5 to 30KB per page at 300dpi (3 to 10 times smaller than PDF or TIFF)* color scanned documents: 30 to 100KB per page at 300dpi (5 to 10 times smaller than JPEG).* photos: 2 times smaller than JPEG, about the same as JPEG-2000, but the decoder/renderer       is progressive and has minimal memory requirements.* palettized images: 2 times smaller than GIF (up to 10 times if it's mostly text).* digital (non scanned) documents: between 1 and 3 times smaller than PDF or gzipped PS           (depending on the amount of pictures), but rendering, page flipping, zooming, panning           are incomparably faster, and the image quality on screen desplays is much better           (antialiased text, etc).  More importantly, all DjVu images render very quickly and can be smoothly zoomed and panned. Pages of a document can be turned instantly, with no annoying delay. DjVu is used by [hundreds of academic, commercial, governmental, and non-commercial web sites](http://www.djvuzone.org/links/index.html) around the world to distribute scanned documents, digital documents, and high-resolution photos. A short [technical description of DjVu is available here](abstract.html). Demos, and general information about DjVu can be found at [DjVuZone.org](http://www.djvuzone.org), or at [LizardTech.com](http://www.lizardtech.com). DjVu was originally developped at [AT&T Labs-Research](http://www.research.att.com). In March 2000, AT&T sold DjVu to [LizardTech Inc.](http://www.lizardtech.com) who now distributes Windows/CE/Mac plug-ins, and commercial encoders. DjVuLibre is an open source implementation of DjVu. See the [credits/history](credits.html#credits) page for more details.  | **What's inside DjVu?** | | --- |   A short [technical description of DjVu is available here](abstract.html). In short, DjVu is a multipage document format that can use a number of different coder/decoders (codecs) to compress the individual chunks that compose an images or a page. In fact, DjVu is really four compression techniques wrapped into one format:  * **DjVuPhoto** (aka IW44): A progressive, wavelet-based lossy compression   format for continuous-tone images (i.e. photos and pictures).* **DjVuBitonal** (aka JB2): A lossless or lossy compression technique     for bitonal (black & white) or palettized images that is particularly     effective on images with repeated shapes (such as documents images     where the same character appears many times in the document).* **DjVuDocument**: A technique for scanned color document that separates       images into a foreground layer that contains the text and line drawings,       and a background layer that contains the pictures and background textures.       The foreground is encoded with DjVuBitonal and the Background with DjVuPhoto.* **BZZ**: A general-purpose data compression technique similar to bzip2.         Bzz is used to compress searchable text layers and other metadata         in DjVu documents.  DjVu can be seen as nicely complementing [PNG and MNG](http://www.libpng.org) (which, unlike DjVu are lossless formats) in the areas of document image compression and lossy photo compression. DjVuPhoto is a bit older, but similar in spirit to JPEG-2000. It is on a par with JPEG-2000 in terms of image quality and file size, but it compares favorably in terms of rendering time and memory requirements. DjVuBitonal is better than MMR/GroupIV (used by PDF, TIFF, and most fax machines) by about a factor of 3 to 10. It is also better than the emerging standard JBIG2 by about 20%. | **What is DjVuLibre?** | | --- |   In an effort to promote DjVu as a Web standard, LizardTech's management was enlightened enough to release the reference implementation of DjVu under the GNU GPL in October 2000. DjVuLibre (pronounced like the French "déjà vu libre", which means free DjVu), is an enhanced version of that code maintained by the original inventors of DjVu. It is compatible with version 3.5 of LizardTech's DjVu software suite. DjVuLibre includes:  * A standalone DjVu viewer for Unix under X11 (based on the Qt library).* A browser plugin that works with most Unix browsers, including:     Netscape-4.x, Netscape-6.x, Mozilla, Galeon, Konqueror, and Opera.* A full-fledged wavelet-based compressor for pictures.* A simple compressor for bitonal (black and white) scanned pages.* A very simple compressor for scanned color pages.* A compressor for palettized images (a la GIF/PNG).* A full set of utilities to manipulate and assemble DjVu images and documents.* A set of decoders to convert DjVu to a number of other formats.* An up-to-date version of the C++ DjVu Reference Library   Windows and Mac versions of the viewer/plug-in, free Windows compressors, and high-end commercial compressors and OCR engines are available from [LizardTech Inc.](http://www.lizardtech.com). The compressors provided here are slower, produce larger files (sometimes with lower image quality) than the commercial compressors, but they do the job. For those who like quick solutions without having to install software, a variety of free web-based conversion services are also available, including [Any2DjVu](http://any2djvu.djvuzone.org) and [Bib2Web](http://bib2web.djvuzone.org). |  | |  |  |  | |

## Vulnerability in DjVuLibre Could Allow Remote Code Execution

Published: March 19, 2013

**Version:** 1.0

### Overview

#### Executive Summary

Microsoft is providing notification of the discovery and remediation of a vulnerability affecting DjVuLibre software version 3.5.25 and earlier versions. Microsoft discovered and disclosed the vulnerability under coordinated vulnerability disclosure to the DjVuLibre project maintainers. The DjVuLibre project maintainers have remediated the vulnerability in their software.

A vulnerability exists when the an application using DjVuLibre parses DjVu (.djv) files in a way that results in memory corruption. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could could run arbitrary code in the security context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

Microsoft Vulnerability Research reported this issue to and coordinated with the DjVuLibre project to ensure remediation of this issue. The vulnerability has been assigned the entry CVE-2012-6535 in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list. For more information, including information about updates from DjVuLibre, see the [DjVuLibre website](https://djvu.sourceforge.net/).

#### Mitigating Factors

* This vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

### Advisory Details

#### Purpose and Recommendation

**Purpose of Advisory:** To notify users of a vulnerability and its remediation.

**Advisory Status:** Advisory published.

## Advisory FAQ

**What is the scope of this advisory?**

This advisory is part of a coordinated release with affected vendors to inform customers of a security issue that may affect their systems.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

No. This vulnerability has been fixed via an update from the affected third-party vendors. The update remediates the software listed in the table, **Affected Software**.

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A vulnerability exists when an application using DjVuLibre parses DjVu (.djv) files in a way that results in memory corruption.

**How is this vulnerability remediated in applications that use DjVuLibre?**

This vulnerability has been remediated in DjVuLibre software, including DjView, by updating DjVuLibre to a non-affected version. Third-party vendors have remediated their software (including Evince, Sumatra PDF Reader, and VuDroid) by updating DjVuLibre to a non-affected version and then redistributing their software.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted file with an application that uses an affected version of DjVuLibre. Typically, these specially crafted files are delivered via social engineering techniques in email, instant messaging, or via download links on websites. This vulnerability cannot be exploited without user interaction.

## Suggested Actions

**For end users**

Update to the latest version of any product incorporating DjVuLibre.

**For developers of affected third-party applications**

Ensure that your software is incorporating the latest version of DjVuLibre.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2844-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Raphael Geissert
January 15, 2014                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : djvulibre
Vulnerability  : arbitrary code execution
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-6535

It was discovered that djvulibre, the Open Source DjVu implementation
project, can be crashed or possibly make it execute arbitrary code when
processing a specially crafted djvu file.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.23-3+squeeze1.

This problem has been fixed before the release of the stable distribution
(wheezy), therefore it is not affected.

We recommend that you upgrade your djvulibre packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

# USN-2056-1: DjVuLibre vulnerability

16 December 2013

DjVuLibre could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened
a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [djvulibre](/security/cves?package=djvulibre) - DjVu image format library and tools

## Details

It was discovered that DjVuLibre incorrectly handled certain memory

operations. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a

specially crafted DjVu file, applications could be made to crash, resulting

in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

### Reduce your security exposure
