Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-6535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how DjVuLibre parses DjVu (.djv) files, leading to memory corruption. Specifically, there's a flaw in the `libdjvu/GString.cpp` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of DjVu files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Applications using DjVuLibre can crash.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the security context of the user running the affected application. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attachments:** An attacker can send a crafted DjVu file as an email attachment. The user has to open the attachment to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker can host a website containing a specially crafted DjVu file. The user would need to visit this website and open the malicious file, which can be achieved via social engineering by tricking users to click a link.
- **Compromised Websites:**  Attacker can inject the malicious content in compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted DjVu file.
- The attacker needs to deliver this file to the victim via email, a website, or other means.
- The attacker relies on user interaction, as the user needs to open the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects DjVuLibre software version 3.5.25 and earlier.
- The issue was discovered by Microsoft Vulnerability Research.
- The vulnerability was fixed by improving the logic in `libdjvu/GString.cpp`.
- Affected applications include `djview`, `Evince`, `Sumatra PDF Reader`, and `VuDroid`, which all needed to update their DjVuLibre component to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is assigned the CVE ID CVE-2012-6535.
