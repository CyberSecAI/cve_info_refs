The provided content is related to CVE-2012-6571.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a weak and predictable HTTP session ID generation mechanism in the HTTP module of Huawei's Branch Intelligent Management System (BIMS) and Web management interfaces. This weak generation makes the session IDs easily guessable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Predictable HTTP session IDs: The session IDs generated are not sufficiently random, making them vulnerable to brute-force attacks or session hijacking.
- Lack of proper session management.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: An attacker can guess or predict valid session IDs and use them to impersonate legitimate users.
- Unauthorized Access: After hijacking a session, an attacker could gain access to device management functions, potentially affecting the operation of the device, or launch further attacks.
- Impact on device operation: Attackers could send crafted HTTP messages after hijacking a session, potentially leading to disruptions or malicious changes to the device configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the device's management interface.
- Web interface interaction: The vulnerability is exploitable when a user is actively logged into the device's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker needs to be able to reach the device's management interface IP address.
- Knowledge of an active session: The attacker needs an active web session in order to try to hijack it.
- Ability to enumerate or predict the HTTP session ID: The attacker can then use the guessed IDs to impersonate the victim.

**Affected Products:**
- Huawei AR routers (AR18/28/46, AR19/29/49) with specific software versions.
- Huawei S2000, S3000, S3500, S3900, S5100, S5600, and some S7800 series switches with specific software versions that support web management.
