Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6103:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The messaging system in Moodle was not correctly validating user sessions when sending messages. Specifically, it was missing a session key check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The lack of proper session validation made the messaging system vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This means a malicious user could craft a request that would be executed in the context of another, authenticated user, causing the legitimate user to perform actions without their consent or knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially send messages to other users using the compromised user's account. The content of these messages would be chosen by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- CSRF attacks typically involve tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that then performs actions on their behalf on a separate, vulnerable web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious request targeting the vulnerable messaging functionality, and the user must be logged into the Moodle system and interact with the attacker's malicious link/site. The attacker does not necessarily need to have access to the Moodle system themselves but requires a user of the system as a victim to carry out the attack.
