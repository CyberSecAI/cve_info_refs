- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Age Verification" version 0.4 does not properly validate the `redirect_to` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary external website.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open redirect vulnerability. The plugin directly uses the value of the `redirect_to` parameter to construct a redirect URL without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when clicked by a user, redirects the user to a website controlled by the attacker. This can be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  **GET parameter:** The `redirect_to` parameter can be supplied through the URL.
    -  **POST parameter:** The `redirect_to` parameter can be supplied through the POST request body, along with age verification parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request (GET or POST) to the vulnerable endpoint with the crafted `redirect_to` parameter. No prior authentication is needed.
