Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is described as "Several potential security vulnerabilities" within Magento 1.7.0.1. The specific vulnerabilities were not explicitly detailed in the release notes or this email.
- One of the addressed issues was a security vulnerability in Zend_XmlRpc, which was previously assigned CVE-2012-3363.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The email mentions "Several potential security vulnerabilities" were fixed in Magento 1.7.0.1, implying multiple weaknesses. However, specific types of vulnerabilities are not enumerated.
- One confirmed weakness was related to Zend_XmlRpc (CVE-2012-3363).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The content implies that successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities could lead to serious issues, especially given that "these sites handle large volumes of money," suggesting potential financial loss or data breaches could occur if the flaws were exploited by attackers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vectors are not detailed. However, given one of the fixed vulnerabilities is related to Zend_XmlRpc, an attack vector would likely involve the use of XML-RPC to exploit the weakness.
- The email suggests that attackers could spend time analyzing the code changes (diff files) between versions to identify vulnerabilities

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The required capabilities would include an understanding of the Magento platform and the ability to analyze code changes, specifically the differences between Magento versions to identify the underlying vulnerabilities.
- The attacker would also need knowledge related to the type of vulnerability present (XML-RPC in at least one case), to craft a working exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The email highlights a concerning trend of vendors not providing sufficient information about vulnerabilities ("security by obscurity"), making it harder for users to assess and mitigate risks.
- The content points to a lack of transparency from the vendor.

In summary, CVE-2012-6091 is a placeholder CVE assigned to "several potential security vulnerabilities" fixed in Magento 1.7.0.1 and a vulnerability related to Zend_XmlRpc. The specific vulnerabilities are not detailed.
