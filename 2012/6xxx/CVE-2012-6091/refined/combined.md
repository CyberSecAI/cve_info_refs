Honestly I'm not going to waste any time on tracking these down, it
would take hours to go through the above mentioned 1.8 meg diff file
that contains these security flaws. So with this in mind:

<http://www.magentocommerce.com/download/release_notes>
Release Notes - Magento 1.7.0.1 (Jun 20, 2012)
Fixed: Several potential security vulnerabilities

Please use CVE-2012-6091 for these issues.

But here's a hint: it would only take a few hours to hunt down the
flaws. And according to the argument "these sites handle large volumes
of money" it would be worth an attackers time to read the diff file,
so this obscurity argument only hurts the users/admins since they will
have to waste time figuring out if they need to apply this patch or
not or if there is a workaround, or what they should do to see if they
have already been attacked/etc.

Feel free to post a copy of this on their forums.
