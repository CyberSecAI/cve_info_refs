## How can the Institute help you?

* ### Data Storage and Collection

  ### Data Storage and Collection

  The institute offers a tool called REDCap that is a secure, HIPAA-compliant, web-based application for databases and online surveys for research purposes. Request an institute consultation to learn more.

  [Learn More about REDCap](/research-support/redcap/)
  [Request a consultation](/request)
* ### Research Populations

  ### Research Populations

  The institute has several tools available to search the electronic health record for research population discovery and study feasibility.

  Options include TriNetX as well as the Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) Network, which accesses data across the Clinical and Translational Science Award consortium.

  [Request a consultation](/request)

  [Learn more about TriNetX](/research-support/trinetx/)[Learn more about the ACT Network](/research-support/act-network/)
* ### Study Design

  ### Study Design

  The institute offers several resources for study design.

  + [Biostatistics, epidemiology and research design consultations](/consultations/#question_biosttisticsepidemiologyandresearchdesign) offer training in biostatistical and epidemiological methodologies and assistance to investigators in study design, data management and analysis.
  + [Community engagement consultations](/consultations/#question_communityengagement) assist with identifying stakeholders, establishing a project in the community, helping with interdisciplinary teams and community partners and more.
  + [Community Engagement Studios](/community/resources/#question_communityengagementstudios) are one-time, 90-minute meetings where community members give feedback and advice to improve upon investigators’ research projects.
  + [Regulatory and ethics consultations](/consultations/#question_regulatoryandethics) help transform novel research ideas into scientifically and ethically sound research study protocols that are in compliance with regulatory requirements.
  + [Trial Innovation Network provides assistance with national, multi-site clinical trials.](/research-support/clinical/#question_trialinnovationnetwork)

* ### Study Operation and Recruitment

  ### Study Operation and Recruitment

  The institute offers human subjects research infrastructure through its Clinical Research Centers, located in both Hershey and University Park. Both centers include research nursing staff and dedicated clinic space and equipment.

  [Learn more about the CRC](/research-support/clinical/)

  Study recruitment help is available through consultations with the institute’s study recruitment project manager. The institute also sponsors [Studyfinder](https://studyfinder.psu.edu), the University’s tool for the public to search for actively recruiting studies; and ResearchMatch, a national tool to help connect willing participants with studies they might be qualified to volunteer for.

  Clinical research guidebooks are available that detail the clinical research process and available support resources at Penn State University Park and Penn State College of Medicine.

  [Explore clinical research guidebooks](/research-support/clinical/#question_clinicalresearchguidebook)

  A team science toolbox provides tools and resources for forming, launching and maintaining research teams. It provides practical, pertinent team knowledge that addresses specific and common team needs and assessment methods.

  [Request a consultation](/request)
* ### Informatics

  ### Informatics

  The institute offers consultations with its informatics project manager to aid in the integration of informatics in translational research activities; integration of electronic health records with genomic, contextual (environmental and socioeconomic) and wearable sensor data, etc.; and design, implementation and deployment of advanced data analytics.

  In addition, it has several tools and data sets available to search the electronic health record for cohort discovery and study feasibility.

  [Learn more about Informatics](/informatics/)
  [Request a consultation](/request)
* ### Biostatistics

  ### Biostatistics

  The institute offers biostatistics consultations and education through its Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Research Design core, including design and analysis strategies for research proposals, sample size and power calculations for research proposals, advice on the selection and implementation of appropriate statistical methods for research data, statistical review of grant proposals, protocols and manuscripts, and advice on data management and REDCap database development for research studies.

  [Request a consultation](https://app-phs.hmc.psu.edu/walkin2/forms/walkin_form.cfm)
* ### Training

  ### Training

  The institute offers several training programs including an Early-Stage Investigator Program (KL2); a Graduate Student Training Program (TL1); a Medical/Graduate Student Translational Science Fellowship; a Community-Engaged Research Faculty Fellowship; and a dual-title graduate degree in clinical and translational science.

  In addition, educational seminars are held throughout the year for the Penn State community about practical information for clinical and translational science, about biostatistical research topics and about novel research methods.
