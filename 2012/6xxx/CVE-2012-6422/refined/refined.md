{
  "CVE-2012-6422": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `/dev/exynos-mem` device file, intended for graphics-related memory access, had insecure default permissions (read/write for all users) and lacked proper restrictions on memory regions accessible through mmap. This allowed any application to access the entire physical memory.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Insecure default file permissions on `/dev/exynos-mem`",
        "Lack of proper memory access restrictions in the `exynos_mem_mmap` function",
         "Absence of checks to ensure that the memory regions being accessed are within the allocated DMA spaces."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain full read/write access to all physical memory on the affected devices, including kernel memory, leading to:\n  -Arbitrary code execution\n  -Kernel code injection\n  -Data exfiltration\n  -Device rooting\n  -Potential for permanent device damage",
      "Attack vectors": "Malicious apps installed from the Play Store or other sources can exploit the vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to install a malicious application on the target device. No other special capabilities are required."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `/dev/exynos-mem` device file provides read/write access to all users, allowing access to all of the physical memory.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Device file `/dev/exynos-mem` has insecure permissions, granting read/write access to all users.",
        "Lack of proper memory region checks when using the mmap operation on the `/dev/exynos-mem` device."
      ],
     "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain root access and take complete control of the device. This could lead to:\n   - Data theft from other applications or the OS.\n   - Kernel code injection and arbitrary code execution.\n   - The potential to cause permanent damage to the device.",
      "Attack vectors": "Malicious applications installed through the Play Store or other means can exploit this vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the capability to install an application on the target device."
