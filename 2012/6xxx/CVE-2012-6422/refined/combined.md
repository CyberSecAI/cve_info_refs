**EDIT: For general discussion about this topic, please post in the following location (and not here): <http://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=2057818>**

**Now find a one-click root application at** <http://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=2130276>. More exploits coming.

Hi,

Recently discover a way to obtain root on S3 without ODIN flashing.

The security hole is in kernel, exactly with the device /dev/exynos-mem.

This device is R/W by all users and give access to **all physical memory** ![:confused:](data:image/gif;base64... "Confused    :confused:") ... what's wrong with Samsung ?

Its like /dev/mem but for all.

Three libraries seems to use /dev/exynos-mem:

* /system/lib/hw/camera.smdk4x12.so
* /system/lib/hw/gralloc.smdk4x12.so
* /system/lib/libhdmi.so

Many devices are concerned :

* Samsung Galaxy S2
* Samsung Galxy Note 2
* MEIZU MX
* potentialy all devices who embed exynos processor (4210 and 4412) which use Samsung kernel sources.

The good news is we can easily obtain root on these devices and the bad is there is no control over it.

Ram dump, kernel code injection and others could be possible via app installation from Play Store. It certainly exists many ways

to do that but Samsung give an easy way to exploit. This security hole is **dangerous** and expose phone to malicious apps.

Exploitation with native C and JNI could be easily feasible.

**Edited**

Some details :

/dev/exynos-mem seems to be used for graphic usage like camera, graphic memory allocation, hdmi.

By activating pid display in kmsg, surfaceflinger do mmap on the device (via one of the three shared libraries above ?? I have not see reference in binary to these libraires)

The operations allowed on the device are (from linux/drivers/char/mem.c) :

Code:

```
static const struct file_operations exynos_mem_fops = {
    .open       = exynos_mem_open,
    .release    = exynos_mem_release,
    .unlocked_ioctl = exynos_mem_ioctl,
    .mmap       = exynos_mem_mmap,
}
```

and the default permissions (from linux/drivers/char/mem.c) :

Code:

```
#ifdef CONFIG_EXYNOS_MEM
    [14] = {"exynos-mem", S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH
            | S_IWOTH, &exynos_mem_fops},
#endif
```

ioctl request on /dev/exynos-mem permit to clean / flush L1 and L2 cache, set non cacheable page memory and set physical memory address for use with mmap.

Now the interesting part : mmap operation.

The only limit is to restrict access to lowmem (from linux/drivers/char/exynos-mem.c) :

Code:

```
/* TODO: currently lowmem is only avaiable */
if ((phys_to_virt(start) < (void *)PAGE_OFFSET) ||
    (phys_to_virt(start) >= high_memory)) {
    pr_err("[%s] invalid paddr(0x%08x)\n", __func__, start);
    return -EINVAL;
}
```

The comment in above code could be frightening.

And an eye in Documentation/arm/memory.txt say :

Code:

```
Start       End             Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PAGE_OFFSET high_memory-1   Kernel direct-mapped RAM region.
                            This maps the platforms RAM, and typically
                            maps all platform RAM in a 1:1 relationship.
```

In other words, this device **only** permit to own the physical memory including kernel code.

The question is why permissions are set to read/write for all in kernel AND in ueventd.smdk4x12.rc:

* samsung developper in charge of this would lose his job
* some samsung apps with basic rights need to access it (I doubt it)
* a huge mistake

A simple patch could be to set permissions to 0660 or 0600 in ueventd.smdk4x12.rc, but I don't know how it would affect samsung applications/services.

In attachment, binary and source to obtain for root shell.

Removing either read *or* write permissions will kill the camera. I didn't see any other deterioration in anything else.

![rElVQl.png](/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FrElVQl.png%3F2&hash=58958c348d1ebab03d9492aa428a59ef)

My guess the best fix would be to limit the access to the DMA memory spaces which this thing actually needs, the definition of the different CMA areas are in /arch/arm/mach-exynos/mach-midas.c for the S3 and N2.

Front camera for example:

Code:

```
#ifndef CONFIG_USE_FIMC_CMA
		{
			.name = "fimc1",
			.size = CONFIG_VIDEO_SAMSUNG_MEMSIZE_FIMC1 * SZ_1K,
#if defined(CONFIG_MACH_GC1)
			.start = 0x5ec00000,
#else
			.start = 0x65c00000,
#endif
		},
#endif
```

Generally all memory areas allocated through s5p\_cma\_region\_reserve in /arch/arm/plat-s5p/reserve\_mem.c would be treated as exceptions and everything else needs to be blocked.

Update: [Low-level kernel fix for developers posted here.](http://xdaforums.com/showpost.php?p=35541696&postcount=61)

A kernel based fix as I posted above is the only method to fix the security hole **while also not breaking the camera**. In all other cases if you are not able or willing to flash a kernel, use Chainfire's application.

Very interesting. Thanks for bringing that up. (Have also flagged some Samsung engineers to read this)

Also, I'm building an APK for this to make it easy.

**EDIT:** APK posted here: <http://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=2050297>, download, install, run, and your device is rooted with SuperSU.

**EDIT#2:** This app now also lets you disable the exploit ![:)](data:image/gif;base64... "Smile    :)")

Hey curio,

No need, here is a very quickly put together app in 5 mins that lets you toggle on/off world writability to /dev/exynos-mem

So you can toggle the fix off if you want to use the camera, then toggle it back on afterwards.

Not excusing the "superbrick" bug, just pointing out a few weeks (or in the case of sprint or Vernon a few months) can be expected. Want faster updates?

OK, we're getting into technicalities here, but I consider anything that can be exploited by a Market app without explicit user intervention beyond installing an app (reboot cycles, ADB, etc.) to be "remote". Adam covered how easy it is to bypass Bouncer at BABBQ, so relying on that is a bad idea.

Prior to this, all exploits (restoreRoot, mempodroid, etc) for ICS on Exynos4 devices required ADB to be involved. This doesn't.

And no, you can't cause permanent damage to an HTC with root. The example you provided isn't permanent damage, it can be repaired via JTAG at a service center. Superbrick is \*permanent unrecoverable damage that requires a motherboard replacement - JTAG cannot bring a device that has been damaged back to operation\*. That's a difference between 0 material costs and maybe 30 minutes of labor to repair at a service center and $200-300+ in material costs and significantly more labor.

And your "updates take considerable time" is bull\*\*\*\*. Sprint FI27 was built on September 27 (check the kernel build date), 3 weeks after Samsung had the final version of their protection patch, and was deployed on Kies a matter of \*days\* later. They had an update scheduled, a patch ready to go for three weeks before the update was built, and they shipped without the patch. There's no excuse for that. At that time, it was an "open source problem" because it only affected custom firmwares, and any root exploits known required ADB. Their approach was dependent on an assumption that \*an exploit like this would never happen\* - which is a horrible assumption.

This exploit changes things - there is no a root exploit that can be used by an app straight from the market, in the background, with little to no user intervention.

As to the negative effects of 600 permissions on operation (such as killing camera) - as an interim, setting things to 660 instead of 666 makes things somewhat better protected but not as protected as they should be. I will run some tests later today to confirm that at least any old APK can't get privilege elevation if things are set so only the graphics group can diddle with the memory regions.

Yes what I also started writing allows to restore permissions on /dev/exynos-mem in case you need to use camera, I agree its useful!

The assumption of similar base code isn't a good one... You'd be shocked how many deltas there are between I9100/I777/N7000 stock firmware codebases that shouldn't be there given how similar the devices are.

In the region of the system we're dealing with here (graphics memory allocation), there are significant differences in operation between Exynos 4210 and 4412. There are also significant deltas between the implementations in all of Samsung Mobile's devices and the official public reference source, and frequently deltas between Samsung's implementations for various handsets/tablets that shouldn't be there as you've discovered.

For example, the official reference source does allocations from FIMC1 memory regions in gralloc to support various graphics items. Nearly all of Mobile's implementations allocate ION memory instead of FIMC1 memory even when FIMC1 memory is requested (and yes, this change affects camera operation more than anything else.)

Thanks for the headsup on N80xx, I'll def. have to do a rebuild on N8013. It's pretty frequent for us to have brokenness that doesn't exist on I9300 and vice versa.

Hmm, odd... even when chmodded 660 system.graphics, the exploit appears to succeed on CM10.1 from within an ADB shell...

I need to look more closely at this.

Seems like the shell user is a member of the graphics group...

I think AndreiLux's approach he's working on may be the best.

Has anyone tested to see what the effect of 0600 is on hwaccel video playback? (Seems to be none on CM10.1).

Looks like it's anything that wants FIMC memory that needs exynos-mem, I'll double check ION, that should have failed...

Edit: Yeah, gralloc only accesses exynos-mem when attempting to access FIMC1 memory. I think camera is the main other place where FIMC is used. Actually, in any shipped handset, gralloc should never actually access exynos-mem - gralloc will give ION memory when you ask it for FIMC1 memory, and ION memory allocation doesn't use exynos-mem (hmm, unless libsecion does... I need to check that...)

Because your shell is in graphics group.

Right now older custom kernels will. CM's codebase was just patched earlier today to restrict that node to system.graphics 0660

It was done in the 10.1 branch, so it won't immediately affect all devices. We're working on transitioning all exynos4 devices over to 10.1 this week - it's about halfway done.

**@alephzain**, when running the exploit in an adb shell, sometimes the privilege escalation fails with:

Code:

```
[*] s_show->seq_printf format string found at: 0xC07A70A8

[*] sys_setresuid found at 0xC00945A0

[*] patching sys_setresuid at 0xC00945E4
[!] set user root failed: Operation not permitted
```

And it typically succeed after 1 or 2 more attempts.

Does it ring a bell?

**ExynosAbuse APK updated to v1.10**

I've just updated the ExynosAbuse APK to v1.10 !

This version allows you to disable the exploit (which may break camera), re-enable the exploit (if you need the camera) and to disable the exploit at boot (before any Android app runs). These options do require root (SuperSU or Superuser) to be installed as well. This is for people who actually \*want\* root. If you don't want root, you should use Supercurio's solution as it doesn't depend on being rooted it for dis/reenabling the exploit.

Sooooo....

Here's a low-level fix for the kernel.

Source @ <https://github.com/AndreiLux/Perseus-S3/commit/fb36195dab87e002721c7d1a8294a400c6b40a71>

Edit: Follow-up commit for Note 2 (Possibly N8000 too) users @ <https://github.com/AndreiLux/Perseus-S3/commit/81c95f6046880be48ef377ebae4e42c791f0813e>

I did what I said in the first post. The mmap function checks the given memory addresses against all of the current CMA memory spaces on the device and denies access if the space it out of bound of any of the defined blocks. Furthermore on my S3 I, for now, couldn't find anything breaking beyond the main camera. So I added an additional condition that checks that the accessed memory block is "s3c-fimc" (The camera DMA block) and ignores the other blocks. The whole thing is totally neutered if CONFIG\_CMA\_DMA isn't used in the device configuration (Note 2 / Exynos 4412 devices with 2GB RAM). Edit: Fix works now the same for all devices.

Defined memory spaces:

I didn't care about the permissions set to the sysfs interface as they don't matter anymore.

I'll be deploying the fix tomorrow throughout my kernels.

The only things that needs to be checked by then is if something else breaks, as HDMI or so. I can't test any of that since I don't have a dongle. In that case anyway the kernel log will tell you what other memory space is accessed and I can open that one up too if needed.

Note: Galaxy S2 / 4210 developers may have to add cma\_region\_descriptor\_add calls to from wherever the memory blocks are defined (Machine file definition or arch/arm/plat-s5p/reserve\_mem.c). My commit will work as is on S3 and N2 sources.

I'm off to bed.

First, thank you both for the hard work and quick release.

The main question here is, how efficient is the current implementation in both applications, regarding the protection at start up?

As long as I understand Chainfire somehow ensures that the fix will be applied before running any other (normal) application. Is it possible to install a new application, which to put itself on top of execution chain and exploit the hole, before your application is able to do a 0600 chmod?

If I understand correctly the supercurio's app doesn't promise anything on that matter?! If that is the case, then I guess the recommended app (for rooted phones) will be the Chainfire's solution, right?

Correct.

At the moment, Supercurio's method relies on Android starting it at boot, using the same method any Android app uses to launch at boot. There is no guaranteed order of these apps being launched, and as such, a malicious app could be executing malicious code before the exploit is disabled.

RyanZA's method relies on the same mechanism as well and as such is still vulnerable. Furthermore, unlike Supercurio's and my own patch, RyanZA's patch chmod's to 0600 while ours chmod to 0400 or 0000. With 0600, system user can still run the exploit, so chaining a half-exploit that only gives system user followed by ExynosAbuse may still grant an attacker root access.

My method requires proper root and modifies /system, and disabling the exploit is done before any normal Android app (like those installed from the Play store) have a chance to execute their code. As long as you tell my app to disable the exploit at boot *before* you *install* a malicious app, and providing you do not grant a malicious app root (through SuperSU), this *should* protect against any exploit. Also note that after enabling applying the patch at boot, you can unroot in SuperSU again (SuperSU --> Settings --> Full Unroot) and the patch will keep working, but you'll be unrooted again (if you don't want root). On some devices it takes a reboot for SuperSU to truly disappear after that, by the way.

With my patch, I do advise testing the exploit was disabled after a reboot by running ExynosAbuse again, and verifying both checkboxes next to "Disable exploit" and "Disable exploit on boot" are enabled. These auto-detect the current state, and if the patch on boot was succesful both will be checked.

Also note that after enabling applying the patch at boot, you can unroot in SuperSU again (SuperSU --> Settings --> Full Unroot) and the patch will keep working, but you'll be unrooted again (if you don't want root). On some devices it takes a reboot for SuperSU to truly disappear after that, by the way.

As a preliminary quick-fix the chmod could also be handled in ramfs to ensure it's applied as soon as possible in the boot process.

By the way chmodding to 600 didn't brake any of both cameras on a Samsung 4.1.2 based ROM using the old libs with an update 6 kernel on my dev. S3. Will check if it's also behaving like this on 4.1.1 later today.

Correct. Modifying it in initramfs would be even quicker, but a generic app can't do that. Also chmod to 0400, not 0600.

  **[alephzain](/m/alephzain.3003427/)**

  **EDIT: For general discussion about this topic, please post in the following location (and not here): <http://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=2057818>**

  **Now find a one-click root application at** <http://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=2130276>. More exploits coming.

  Hi,

  Recently discover a way to obtain root on S3 without ODIN flashing.

  The security hole is in kernel, exactly with the device /dev/exynos-mem.

  This device is R/W by all users and give access to **all physical memory** ![:confused:](data:image/gif;base64... "Confused    :confused:") ... what's wrong with Samsung ?

  Its like /dev/mem but for all.

  Three libraries seems to use /dev/exynos-mem:
  + /system/lib/hw/camera.smdk4x12.so
  + /system/lib/hw/gralloc.smdk4x12.so
  + /system/lib/libhdmi.so

  Many devices are concerned :
  + Samsung Galaxy S2
  + Samsung Galxy Note 2
  + MEIZU MX
  + potentialy all devices who embed exynos processor (4210 and 4412) which use Samsung kernel sources.The good news is we can easily obtain root on these devices and the bad is there is no control over it.

  Ram dump, kernel code injection and others could be possible via app installation from Play Store. It certainly exists many ways

  to do that but Samsung give an easy way to exploit. This security hole is **dangerous** and expose phone to malicious apps.

  Exploitation with native C and JNI could be easily feasible.

  **Edited**

  Some details :

  /dev/exynos-mem seems to be used for graphic usage like camera, graphic memory allocation, hdmi.

  By activating pid display in kmsg, surfaceflinger do mmap on the device (via one of the three shared libraries above ?? I have not see reference in binary to these libraires)

  The operations allowed on the device are (from linux/drivers/char/mem.c) :

  Code:

  ```
  static const struct file_operations exynos_mem_fops = {
      .open       = exynos_mem_open,
      .release    = exynos_mem_release,
      .unlocked_ioctl = exynos_mem_ioctl,
      .mmap       = exynos_mem_mmap,
  }
  ```

  and the default permissions (from linux/drivers/char/mem.c) :

  Code:

  ```
  #ifdef CONFIG_EXYNOS_MEM
      [14] = {"exynos-mem", S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH
              | S_IWOTH, &exynos_mem_fops},
  #endif
  ```

  ioctl request on /dev/exynos-mem permit to clean / flush L1 and L2 cache, set non cacheable page memory and set physical memory address for use with mmap.

  Now the interesting part : mmap operation.

  The only limit is to restrict access to lowmem (from linux/drivers/char/exynos-mem.c) :

  Code:

  ```
  /* TODO: currently lowmem is only avaiable */
  if ((phys_to_virt(start) < (void *)PAGE_OFFSET) ||
      (phys_to_virt(start) >= high_memory)) {
      pr_err("[%s] invalid paddr(0x%08x)\n", __func__, start);
      return -EINVAL;
  }
  ```

  The comment in above code could be frightening.

  And an eye in Documentation/arm/memory.txt say :

  Code:

  ```
  Start       End             Use
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PAGE_OFFSET high_memory-1   Kernel direct-mapped RAM region.
                              This maps the platforms RAM, and typically
                              maps all platform RAM in a 1:1 relationship.
  ```

  In other words, this device **only** permit to own the physical memory including kernel code.

  The question is why permissions are set to read/write for all in kernel AND in ueventd.smdk4x12.rc:
  + samsung developper in charge of this would lose his job
  + some samsung apps with basic rights need to access it (I doubt it)
  + a huge mistakeA simple patch could be to set permissions to 0660 or 0600 in ueventd.smdk4x12.rc, but I don't know how it would affect samsung applications/services.

  In attachment, binary and source to obtain for root shell.

  Very interesting. Thanks for bringing that up. (Have also flagged some Samsung engineers to read this)

  Also, I'm building an APK for this to make it easy.

  **EDIT:** APK posted here: <http://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=2050297>, download, install, run, and your device is rooted with SuperSU.

  **EDIT#2:** This app now also lets you disable the exploit ![:)](data:image/gif;base64... "Smile    :)")

  Sooooo....

  Here's a low-level fix for the kernel.

  Source @ <https://github.com/AndreiLux/Perseus-S3/commit/fb36195dab87e002721c7d1a8294a400c6b40a71>

  Edit: Follow-up commit for Note 2 (Possibly N8000 too) users @ <https://github.com/AndreiLux/Perseus-S3/commit/81c95f6046880be48ef377ebae4e42c791f0813e>

  I did what I said in the first post. The mmap function checks the given memory addresses against all of the current CMA memory spaces on the device and denies access if the space it out of bound of any of the defined blocks. Furthermore on my S3 I, for now, couldn't find anything breaking beyond the main camera. So I added an additional condition that checks that the accessed memory block is "s3c-fimc" (The camera DMA block) and ignores the other blocks. The whole thing is totally neutered if CONFIG\_CMA\_DMA isn't used in the device configuration (Note 2 / Exynos 4412 devices with 2GB RAM). Edit: Fix works now the same for all devices.

  Defined memory spaces:

  I didn't care about the permissions set to the sysfs interface as they don't matter anymore.

  I'll be deploying the fix tomorrow throughout my kernels.

  The only things that needs to be checked by then is if something else breaks, as HDMI or so. I can't test any of that since I don't have a dongle. In that case anyway the kernel log will tell you what other memory space is accessed and I can open that one up too if needed.

  Note: Galaxy S2 / 4210 developers may have to add cma\_region\_descriptor\_add calls to from wherever the memory blocks are defined (Machine file definition or arch/arm/plat-s5p/reserve\_mem.c). My commit will work as is on S3 and N2 sources.

  I'm off to bed.

  **[AndreiLux](/m/andreilux.4167023/)**

  Removing either read *or* write permissions will kill the camera. I didn't see any other deterioration in anything else.

  ![rElVQl.png](/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FrElVQl.png%3F2&hash=58958c348d1ebab03d9492aa428a59ef)

  My guess the best fix would be to limit the access to the DMA memory spaces which this thing actually needs, the definition of the different CMA areas are in /arch/arm/mach-exynos/mach-midas.c for the S3 and N2.

  Front camera for example:

  Code:

  ```
  #ifndef CONFIG_USE_FIMC_CMA
  		{
  			.name = "fimc1",
  			.size = CONFIG_VIDEO_SAMSUNG_MEMSIZE_FIMC1 * SZ_1K,
  #if defined(CONFIG_MACH_GC1)
  			.start = 0x5ec00000,
  #else
  			.start = 0x65c00000,
  #endif
  		},
  #endif
  ```

  Generally all memory areas allocated through s5p\_cma\_region\_reserve in /arch/arm/plat-s5p/reserve\_mem.c would be treated as exceptions and everything else needs to be blocked.

  Update: [Low-level kernel fix for developers posted here.](http://xdaforums.com/showpost.php?p=35541696&postcount=61)

  A kernel based fix as I posted above is the only method to fix the security hole **while also not breaking the camera**. In all other cases if you are not able or willing to flash a kernel, use Chainfire's application.

  **ExynosAbuse APK updated to v1.10**

  I've just updated the ExynosAbuse APK to v1.10 !

  This version allows you to disable the exploit (which may break camera), re-enable the exploit (if you need the camera) and to disable the exploit at boot (before any Android app runs). These options do require root (SuperSU or Superuser) to be installed as well. This is for people who actually \*want\* root. If you don't want root, you should use Supercurio's solution as it doesn't depend on being rooted it for dis/reenabling the exploit.

Because an exploit and vulnerability has been released long before vendors had a chance to fix it and distributes patches, I though it could be useful to develop an app that regular people, who don't necessarily want to root or mod their devices can install to avoid being vulnerable.

Vulnerability and exploit by alephzain : <http://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=2048511>

[The application page on my blog](http://project-voodoo.org/articles/instant-fix-app-for-exynos-mem-abuse-vulnerability-no-root-required-reversible)

![voodoo-exynos-vulnerability-app-168x300.png](/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fproject-voodoo.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F12%2Fvoodoo-exynos-vulnerability-app-168x300.png&hash=557e88c0661a8a2cd842bb12857f2f50)

Characteristics of this app:

* Works on any device, let you know if your system is vulnerable
* Doesn’t require root to apply the fix
* Doesn’t modify your system, copy files or flash anything
* Fix can be enabled or disable at will
* Free of charge

Limitations:

* Break proper function of the Front camera on some Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II Samsung official firmwares when activated.
* Might alter MHL/HDMI output functions on some devices (not confirmed)
* Cannot protect efficiently against some potential attacks (typically, on boot).
* The real fix by manufacturers or some carefully written custom kernels will indeed be the only true solutions to this vulnerability − and won’t introduce any feature regression like this one does with some firmwares on cameras.
* Comes without any kind of support or warranty.

**SPH-L710 is unaffected**

It looks like my Samsung Galaxy S III is unaffected by this exploit. I have the Sprint version (SPH-L710). Either Samsung pushed an update or it isn't affected on this model.

Neither of your phones have Exynos processors. The international GS2&3 and the Sprint variant of the GS2 are a few of the susceptible devices.

Glad folks like you are out there making up for others irresponsible actions. This is probably the exploit used to hack phantom phaker's E4GT, and that guy is a scripting genius.

You are INCORRECT, the ORIGINAL AT&T S2 "I777" is an exact replica of the international except for the capacitive buttons....He knows what he's saying it is an EXYNOS device!!!!

the galaxy camera also has this vulnerability, but the camera function still works fine after applying your fix.

Thanks for such a quick fix. The app says my SGS2 is vulnerable, so I activated it instantly. Good thing both cameras function properly. Is there anything else that could malfunction with the fix applied?

My Galaxy Note II LTE(N7105) cameras (front and rear) work fine after activated.

However I still wanna ask what malfunction of front camera is/are?

I find interesting to have a rough idea of how many people get a fix, and then compare with the total amount of vulnerable systems that can be guessed by approximate sales announced.

Also, in case (which I don't hope) Samsung or some Carriers tend to be slow at releasing an update fixing properly this vulnerability, those install statistics might be a way to pressure them hurrying up.

I would have not used additional analytics if the app was released on Google Play, as it lets you know already plenty of details about apps installations.

But as my app uses the exploit to detect the presence of the vulnerability Google would have probably removed it quickly, and banned my account at the same time; A risk I cannot afford.

Well if the app is saying that his device is unaffected, then he does not have the ORIGINAL AT&T S2 and thus does not have Exynos processors. I stand by my statement.

I don't know many details and it is all second hand. I will try to get someone closer to the situation in here to comment as to provide more accurate information.

EDIT: and I should clarify. It has been speculated by other users that this was the exploit used to hack phaker's phone. I have not heard this from phaeker himself.

Your anti virus doesn't know the difference between a fix and a malware (I guess it detects the exploit I'm using as tool to protect against itself)

Rather than edit my last post and miss your attention, I'm posting a new response. After speaking with someone with current/direct contact with phaeker, his issue has been resolved and was unrelated but if you would like to contact him via PM, you are more than welcome to.

Thank you very much for this patch.

I have 2 N7100:

- 1 - Root + Crash 3.1 Rom's - N7100XXALJ2 - Kernel Redpill 0.10

- 2 - Not root + Samsung rom's - N7100XXDLK7-Kernel 3.0.31-590308 SMP PREEMPT

2 phones were impacted by the weakness. After the application of the patch, the camera on 2 phones do not work any more ( green screen).

Sorry for my bad English.

  **[supercurio](/m/supercurio.2617206/)**

  Because an exploit and vulnerability has been released long before vendors had a chance to fix it and distributes patches, I though it could be useful to develop an app that regular people, who don't necessarily want to root or mod their devices can install to avoid being vulnerable.

  Vulnerability and exploit by alephzain : <http://xdaforums.com/showthread.php?t=2048511>

  [The application page on my blog](http://project-voodoo.org/articles/instant-fix-app-for-exynos-mem-abuse-vulnerability-no-root-required-reversible)

  ![voodoo-exynos-vulnerability-app-168x300.png](/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fproject-voodoo.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F12%2Fvoodoo-exynos-vulnerability-app-168x300.png&hash=557e88c0661a8a2cd842bb12857f2f50)

  ![voodoo-exynos-vulnerability-app-1-168x300.png](/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fproject-voodoo.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F12%2Fvoodoo-exynos-vulnerability-app-1-168x300.png&hash=befeb052c6b2eafb4104a9e1b8bfc02a)

  Characteristics of this app:

  + Works on any device, let you know if your system is vulnerable
  + Doesn’t require root to apply the fix
  + Doesn’t modify your system, copy files or flash anything
  + Fix can be enabled or disable at will
  + Free of charge

  Limitations:

  + Break proper function of the Front camera on some Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II Samsung official firmwares when activated.
  + Might alter MHL/HDMI output functions on some devices (not confirmed)
  + Cannot protect efficiently against some potential attacks (typically, on boot).
  + The real fix by manufacturers or some carefully written custom kernels will indeed be the only true solutions to this vulnerability − and won’t introduce any feature regression like this one does with some firmwares on cameras.
  + Comes without any kind of support or warranty.

  Neither of your phones have Exynos processors. The international GS2&3 and the Sprint variant of the GS2 are a few of the susceptible devices.

  Glad folks like you are out there making up for others irresponsible actions. This is probably the exploit used to hack phantom phaker's E4GT, and that guy is a scripting genius.

  Thank you very much for this patch.

  I have 2 N7100:

  - 1 - Root + Crash 3.1 Rom's - N7100XXALJ2 - Kernel Redpill 0.10

  - 2 - Not root + Samsung rom's - N7100XXDLK7-Kernel 3.0.31-590308 SMP PREEMPT

  2 phones were impacted by the weakness. After the application of the patch, the camera on 2 phones do not work any more ( green screen).

  Sorry for my bad English.

# Developer warns of critical vulnerability in many Samsung smartphones

Hole in Android kernel gives full read-write permissions to all physical memory.

A software developer says he has identified a critical vulnerability in many Samsung smartphone models that can open up end users to malware attacks and expose bank account credentials and other sensitive data to attackers.

The security hole, according to a [post published Saturday on the XDA Developer Forum](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=35469999), resides in the Android kernel of Samsung handsets running an Exynos 4210 or 4412 processor. While it creates a new and easier method for end users to root their devices, it also gives installed apps full read-write permissions to all physical memory. That, in turn, allows apps to gain unfettered control of a handset, opening the door to malware with rootkit-like capabilities. It also allows one app to monitor data processed by a second app or the operating system.

"This exploit could be dangerous," XDA developer Joseph Hindy wrote in a [follow-up post](https://www.xda-developers.com/android/no-odin-root-exploit-found-for-exynos-4412-and-4210/). "Not only could be used to acquire root access, but for malicious applications as well. So developers will have a fun time helping to fix the issues while using the exploit for root."

Affected devices, according to Hindy, include the Samsung Galaxy Note II, Samsung Galaxy SIII, Meizu MX, and Galaxy S II, among others. The vulnerable libraries, which are located in the /system/lib directories, appear to be connected to the handset camera and other graphics-related functions. The bug makes it possible for attackers to bypass kernel-level system permissions that limit one app's access to data processed by the operating system or other apps.

Following Saturday's disclosure, a different XDA developer released code that [offers some protection from the exploit](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2050297). Readers should carefully consider the pros and cons before installing this app, since it may void handset warranties.

Over the past year, Google has endowed its official Play Store with a cloud-based scanner for detecting malicious apps. The latest version of Android also offers client-side protection for apps that may be obtained from other sources. There are no reports that the Samsung vulnerability is being actively exploited.

# **Major vulnerability found in Exynos 4210 and Exynos 4412 devices**

             [Firmware](https://www.sammobile.com/category/firmware-news/) [By vitorcerq](/author/vitorcerq/ "More from vitorcerq?")

Last updated: February 17th, 2013 at 13:44 UTC+01:00

A Major vulnerability has been found on devices using Exynos 4 SoC and Samsung Kernel sources. The vulnerability was discovered by XDA-Developers' forum member [alephzain](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=3003427). The security flaw is actually in the kernel which makes the device R/W by all users, apps and gives access to full Physical Memory. In short, all Exynos 4 devices come pre-rooted directly from the manufacturers. We can give you one bad news and one good news about this discovery.

The bad news is that any application downloaded from the Google Play Store or installed manually can take FULL control of the device and cause permanent damage, even if the device is not rooted. XDA-Developers' Elite Recognized Developer [Supercurio](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=2617206) is already working on an app which can patch this security hole and prevent apps from taking over the device, he will release the app soon on Google Play Store.

The good news is that with this security flaw rooting an Exynos 4 device has just got a lot easier. XDA-Developers' Elite Recognized Developer [Chainfire](http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=631273) has already released an app called *[ExynosAbuse](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2050297)*which can root a device with just a single click of a button. Now you don't have to flash unsecure or pre-rooted kernels through odin/heimdall on your Samsung device, all can be done via an app.

**Exynos 4210 devices:**

– Samsung Galaxy Note GT-N7000

– Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I9100

– AT&T Samsung Galaxy S2 GT-I777

**Exynos 4412 devices:**

– Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300

– LTE Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9305

– Samsung Galaxy Note 2 GT-N7100

– LTE Samsung Galaxy Note 2 GT-N7105

– Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 GT-N8000

– Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 GT-N8010

– Meizu MX
