rsc@...tux.com

[A] Doesn't have security implications if roundup is correnctly
configured. The bug would create a python backtrace. Unless the "debug"
option in section [web] is set (which is explicitly discouraged) this
will only display "an error has occurred" in the web-interface. Even if
someone sets the debug option in a production release only the hashed
password could be disclosed. Note that this bug only affects the anydbm
backend which should not be used for a production version either.

Please use CVE-2012-6130 for this issue

Please use CVE-2012-6131 for this issue

rsc@...tux.com

[D] No security implications: Fixed some permissions on files in
roundup/cgi and locale directories. These are not accessible via the
web-server. So this doesn't constitute a remote vulnerability. Local
users don't gain anything executing these files as no privilege
escalation is involved (they could copy the file which is readable
anyway and make their local copy executable).

> [E] * Fix another XSS with the "otk" parameter, thanks to Jesse
> Ruderman for reporting. (Ralf)

Please use CVE-2012-6132 for this issue

This appears to be security hardening, not a vulnerability, is that
correct?

Subject: CVE Request -- roundup: Multiple XSS flaws plus other security
 related fixes corrected in upstream 1.4.20 version

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Roundup upstream has released new upstream 1.4.20 version,
correcting multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws (and
couple of other security related issues):
[1] <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/roundup>
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=722672>

More from [1] (plus relevant tickets inlined too, where
possible to find out):
---------------------------------------------------------
[A] * issue2550729: Fix password history display for anydbm backend,
thanks to Ralf Hemmecke for reporting. (Ralf)
[3] <http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550729>

[B] * issue2550684 Fix XSS vulnerability when username contains HTML code,
thanks to Thomas Arendsen Hein for reporting and patch. (Ralf)
[4] <http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550684>

[C] * issue2550711 Fix XSS vulnerability in @action parameter,
thanks to "om" for reporting. (Ralf)
[5] <http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550711>

[D] * Fix wrong execute permissions on some files,
thanks to Cheer Xiao for the patch. (Ralf)

[E] * Fix another XSS with the "otk" parameter,
thanks to Jesse Ruderman for reporting. (Ralf)

[F] * Mark cookies HttpOnly and -- if https is used -- secure. Fixes issue2550689,
but is untested if this really works in browsers. Thanks to Joseph Myers for reporting. (Ralf)
[6] <http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550689>

[G] * Fix another XSS with the ok- and error message, see issue2550724. We solve this differently
from the proposals in the bug-report by not allowing any html-tags in ok/error messages
anymore. Thanks to David Benjamin for the bug-report and to Ezio Melotti for several proposed fixes. (Ralf)
[7] <http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550724>

Cc-ed Ralf Schlatterbeck on this post too to clarify, if issues [A] and [D]
would also have security implications / IOW if those would be security flaws too.
Ralf please clarify. Thank you, Jan.

Could you allocate CVE ids for these (once clarified)?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
