| ``` If you have a user with HTML code in the username, the history of e.g. issues or user details included the unescaped HTML code.  A patch to fix this problem is attached.  I tested with a username ending with:  <a href="<http://www.example.com>">foo</a> which generated a clickable link in the history. ``` |

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper escaping of usernames containing HTML code when displayed in history sections of Roundup's web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the web interface. This could lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' browsers when viewing the history, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker creates a user account with malicious HTML code in their username. When the history is viewed, the unescaped HTML in the username is rendered, leading to the XSS vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create a user account with a crafted username containing malicious HTML.
