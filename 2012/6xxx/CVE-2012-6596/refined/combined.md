### Description

An issue exists whereby LDAP bind passwords are logged to authd.log in clear text when using the default logging level of 'debug'. (Ref #35493)

This issue results in administrator passwords being logged and stored in clear text. Inappropriate access to this information can lead to unauthorized administration of the device.

This issue affects PAN-OS 4.1.2 and earlier; PAN-OS 4.0.8 and earlier; PAN-OS 3.1 is not affected.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 4.1 | <= 4.1.2 | >= 4.1.3 |
| PAN-OS 4.0 | <= 4.0.8 | >= 4.0.9 |

### Severity: MEDIUM

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
6.2 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-255](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/255 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/255")

### Solution

PAN-OS 4.1.3 and later; PAN-OS 4.0.9 and later.

### Workarounds and Mitigations
