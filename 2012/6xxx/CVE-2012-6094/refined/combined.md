| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=891942#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-04 15:21:33 UTC  ``` During the process of CUPS socket activation code refactoring in favour of systemd capability a security flaw was found in the way CUPS service honoured Listen localhost:631 cupsd.conf configuration option. The setting was recognized properly for IPv4-enabled systems, but failed to be correctly applied for IPv6-enabled systems. As a result, a remote attacker could use this flaw to obtain (unauthorized) access to the CUPS web-based administration interface.  References: [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=795624>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=891942#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-01-04 15:23:53 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the cups package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did not use systemd capability for CUPS socket activation yet.  --  This issue affects the versions of the cups package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16 and 17.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c0)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2012-12-21 11:02:57 UTC  ``` on an IPv6-enabled system with a remote IPP printer, but a local cups queue cups sometimes stops printing (after finishing a job?) keeping new jobs in the queue forever.  netstat -tanp|grep 631 tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:631       0.0.0.0:*      LISTEN      842/cupsd tcp        0      0 :::631              :::*           LISTEN      1/init shows in these cases that init (systemd-44-10.4.1.x86_64)  is holding the half of the TCP sockets  an rccups restart does not help, but systemctl stop cups.socket ; rccups restart  made it work, in which case netstat had tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:631       0.0.0.0:*      LISTEN      4569/cupsd tcp        0      0 ::1:631             :::*           LISTEN      4569/cupsd   also possibly a security issue: init is listening on the :: ANY addr ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c1)  Johannes Meixner   2012-12-21 11:20:50 UTC  ``` I have no knowledge how this systemd feature internally works and/or how it is actually implemented in CUPS.  It was provided as patch by crrodriguez@opensuse.org, see the cups RPM changelog entries. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c2)  Johannes Meixner   2012-12-21 11:24:15 UTC  ``` What does "cups sometimes stops printing" actually mean?  Does the cupsd somehow "stop" (i.e. no longer work or even crach or whatever) or gets only the print queue stopped so that via this one print queue no longer jobs get printed? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c3)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2012-12-21 15:33:22 UTC  ``` I could still queue jobs for printing from firefox and lpq would show them and lprm would delete them, but they would not start to be actually printed ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c4)  Frederic Crozat   2013-01-04 11:06:43 UTC  ``` it looks like Fedora folks dropped the IP binding :  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/cups.git/commit/cups-systemd-socket.patch?id=6ef39188975c03f6132a98c8cad20ce80b3d95d9>  I've asked some RH people who can access the bug about it.. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c5)  Frederic Crozat   2013-01-04 11:49:50 UTC  ``` got information from RH folks (they'll see if they can open the bug report): "My experience with it is that it can't really be made to work well due to the way cupsd handles IPv4 vs IPv6 sockets, so I removed the IP socket activation in Fedora until that can be revisited"  I suggest we do the same, by removing:  ListenStream=631 ListenDatagram=0.0.0.0:631 BindIPv6Only=ipv6-only  from cups.socket ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c7)  Sebastian Krahmer   2013-01-07 11:25:40 UTC  ``` got CVE-2012-6094 ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c8)  Michal Vyskocil   2013-01-09 15:18:19 UTC  ``` changing assignee to jsmeix, because this has to be fixed in cups package ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c9)  Johannes Meixner   2013-01-09 15:20:33 UTC  ``` Michal Vyskocil, did you read my [comment#1](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c1) ? ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c10)  Cristian Rodríguez   2013-01-09 15:32:36 UTC  ``` OK.. I will check this one... ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c11)  Johannes Meixner   2013-01-09 15:47:03 UTC  ``` Cristian Rodríguez, very many thanks for your contribution!  Right now I have added you as maintainer for the package cups in the "Printing" project so that you can directly work on CUPS there.  I have one wish when you work on cups in "Printing":  Have in mind that cups in the Printing project is not only built for Factory but also for SLE11 SLE11-SP1 SLE11-SP2 and openSUSE 11.4 12.1 12.2 and Tumbleweed.  If you apply changes that are not fully backward compatible you must implement them in a conditional way in the spec file only for Factory and/or where it does actually work. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=795624#c12)  Johannes Meixner   2014-01-30 08:20:35 UTC  ``` I think this issue here is meanwhile obsoleted since <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=857372#c61> and subsequent comments.  Bernhard Wiedemann, see in particular <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=857372#c75> in short: Please update cups with the cups packages in OBS project "Printing" and report whether or not it works for you.  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 857372](show_bug.cgi?id=857372 "RESOLVED FIXED - systemd socket activation by default either works insecure (CVE-2012-6094 and VUL-0: listening everywhere) or it does not work") *** ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-01-04 19:19:04 UTC  ``` From $URL :  During the process of CUPS socket activation code refactoring in favour of systemd capability a  security flaw was found in the way CUPS service honoured Listen localhost:631 cupsd.conf  configuration option. The setting was recognized properly for IPv4-enabled systems, but failed to  be correctly applied for IPv6-enabled systems. As a result, a remote attacker could use this flaw  to obtain (unauthorized) access to the CUPS web-based administration interface.  References: [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=795624> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sean Amoss (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-03-03 21:20:49 UTC  ``` printing: Fedora's fix [1] was to drop the IP socket activation  [1] <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/cups.git/commit/cups-systemd-socket.patch?id=6ef39188975c03f6132a98c8cad20ce80b3d95d9> ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Andreas K. Hüttel   archtester gentoo-dev  2013-06-06 15:13:59 UTC  ``` @systemd: please help, because I dont really know what this is about ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Michał Górny   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2013-06-06 17:24:11 UTC  ``` I don't understand it either. There's a problem with IPv6, so Fedora disabled IPv4? ;f ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Andreas K. Hüttel   archtester gentoo-dev  2013-06-26 22:56:53 UTC  ``` This is not a regression in 1.6 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  tman    2014-10-25 23:35:25 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 526860](show_bug.cgi?id=526860 "RESOLVED INVALID - net-print/cups-2.0.0-r2 systemd \"cups.socket failed to listen on sockets: Address already in use\"") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  tman    2014-10-25 23:40:40 UTC  ``` this bug report is so old now, but i still get this error with  net-print/cups-2.0.0-r2 and systemd   so there is a solution insight? ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-11-23 01:24:24 UTC  ``` According to <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/cups.git/commit/cups-systemd-socket.patch?id=cdaa46736bfa4cab81fd9fd981138fadeae5d24a> this is now fixed. Fix was <https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/4497> ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-11-23 13:32:17 UTC  ``` Package is now stable, but not vulnerable.  Leaving original whiteboard values in place.  GLSA Vote: No ``` |  |
