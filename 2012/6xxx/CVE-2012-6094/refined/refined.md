{
  "CVE-2012-6094": {
    "Description": "cups (Common Unix Printing System) 'Listen localhost:631' option not honored correctly which could provide unauthorized access to the system",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CUPS service, when using systemd socket activation, incorrectly applied the 'Listen localhost:631' configuration option for IPv6-enabled systems. While it correctly recognized this setting for IPv4, it failed to do so for IPv6, resulting in CUPS listening on all interfaces.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Incorrect handling of 'Listen localhost:631' directive in CUPS configuration when systemd socket activation is enabled for IPv6-enabled systems.",
      "CUPS listening on all interfaces rather than only localhost"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could gain unauthorized access to the CUPS web-based administration interface, potentially allowing them to manipulate print jobs, access sensitive information, or cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks; remote attacker able to connect to CUPS service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to reach the CUPS service network port (631) of the vulnerable system."
