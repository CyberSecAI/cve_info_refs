Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6035:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from multiple issues within the Transcendent Memory (TMEM) hypercall implementation in Xen. Specifically, several sub-operations of the TMEM hypercall lack proper input validation, privilege checks, and have other bugs, leading to memory corruption and denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Client Dereference:** Several TMEM save-related control operations don't check if the client ID is valid, leading to a NULL client dereference which can crash the host or cause memory corruption. Specifically, `TMEMC_SAVE_GET_CLIENT_WEIGHT`, `TMEMC_SAVE_GET_CLIENT_CAP`, `TMEMC_SAVE_GET_CLIENT_FLAGS`, and `TMEMC_SAVE_END` are affected.
*   **Missing Guest Output Buffer Checks:** Functions like `tmemc_save_get_next_page`, `tmemc_save_get_next_inv`, and the `TMEMC_SAVE_GET_POOL_UUID` sub-operation don't validate guest-supplied output buffer pointers, allowing a malicious guest to crash the host or cause memory corruption.
*   **Negative Pool ID Check Missing:** Functions like `tmemc_save_get_next_page`, `tmemc_restore_put_page`, and `tmemc_restore_flush_page` do not check for negative pool IDs, leading to potential memory corruption.
*   **Invalid Pool ID Check Missing:** `do_tmem_destroy_pool` doesn't check for invalid pool IDs, enabling a guest to crash the host or corrupt host memory.
*   **Privilege Check Commented Out:** The privilege check in `do_tmem_control` is commented out, granting any guest access to control stack operations without proper authorization.
*   **Integer Overflow:** `tmh_copy_from_client` and `tmh_copy_to_client` have an integer overflow vulnerability that could lead to host memory corruption.
*   **Spinlock Issue:** `do_tmem_get()`'s bad copy error path leaves a spinlock held, which can lead to a host denial-of-service.
*   **Broken Locking Checks:** An error path in `do_tmem_op` has broken locking checks which can lead to a host DoS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged guest can overwrite hypervisor-owned memory, potentially escalating their privileges to that of the host.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unprivileged guest can crash the hypervisor, leading to a denial-of-service. The vulnerabilities can also lead to hung CPU due to locking issues.
*   **Memory Corruption:**  Several vulnerabilities allow for arbitrary memory corruption on the host.
*   **Code Execution:** In some instances, memory corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through crafted TMEM hypercall requests by a malicious or compromised guest virtual machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a Xen guest virtual machine.
*   The Xen hypervisor must have the "tmem" option enabled at boot time.

**Additional Notes:**

*   TMEM was considered a technology preview and not intended for production use.
*   The Xen.org security team handled TMEM vulnerabilities in public after the embargo ended, as if they were normal bugs.
*   The advisory notes that the list of vulnerabilities is likely not exhaustive.
*   The vulnerabilities are local to the hypervisor.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions that this vulnerability is exploitable locally.
