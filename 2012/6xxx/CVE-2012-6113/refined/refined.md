Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `openssl_encrypt` function in the PHP OpenSSL extension.
- The issue occurs when the function is called with an empty string as the `$data` parameter. In this case, the code does not initialize the variable `i`, which is later used to determine the length of the encrypted output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uninitialized Variable:** The variable `i` is used without being initialized when the input data is an empty string, leading to undefined behavior and arbitrary memory disclosure.
- **Memory Disclosure:** Due to the uninitialized variable, the "encrypted data" output contains arbitrary memory contents. This can include sensitive information such as PHP source code, variable values, and potentially passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Leakage:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information present in the server's memory, which could include:
    - PHP source code
    - Variable values (e.g., database credentials, session IDs)
    - Potentially other application or system secrets.
- **Security Compromise:** This exposed information could allow an attacker to gain further unauthorized access to the system or application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Application Level:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a PHP application that uses the `openssl_encrypt` function and passes an empty string as the data to be encrypted.
- **Web Interface:** This is particularly concerning for web applications where user input or internal application logic might lead to the use of `openssl_encrypt` with empty strings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to invoke the `openssl_encrypt` function with an empty data string.
- This can be done via a web interface, API, or other means depending on the application design.
- The attacker does not require elevated privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to interact with an application running the vulnerable PHP code.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in PHP 5.3.9 by commit `095cbc48a8f0090f3b0abc6155f2b61943c9eafb`.
- It was fixed in PHP 5.3.14 by commit `270a406ac94b5fc5cc9ef59fc61e3b4b95648a3e`.
- The vulnerable code segment in `php5-5.3.10/ext/openssl/openssl.c` is around line 4716:
```c
if (data_len > 0) {
    EVP_EncryptUpdate(&cipher_ctx, outbuf, &i, (unsigned char *)data, data_len);
}
```
- When `data_len` is 0, `i` is not initialized and the output buffer `outbuf` is populated with uninitialized memory.

The fix involves ensuring the variable `i` is properly initialized to zero before the conditional check for data length and the `EVP_EncryptUpdate` function call, avoiding the memory disclosure.
