CVE-2012-6096 is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the history.cgi program in Nagios and Icinga.

**Root cause:** The history.cgi script uses `sprintf` on user-supplied data without restricting the size of the input, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Affected software:**
- Nagios Core
- Icinga

**Impact:**
- Remote command execution (RCE)
- Application crash / Denial of Service (DoS)

**Attack vector:**
- A malicious client can craft a request to `history.cgi` with an overly long `host` parameter.

**Exploitability:**
- Exploit-DB has exploits for Nagios3.
- Requires knowledge of offsets and ROP chains for specific targets.
- Authentication may be required to access the vulnerable `history.cgi` script.
- System protections like SSP and FORTIFY_SOURCE may hinder exploitation, potentially limiting the impact to a denial-of-service.

**Affected systems:**
- openSUSE 11.4, 12.1, 12.2
- Debian (squeeze, wheezy, sid)
- Appliance Nagios XI 2012R1.3 (CentOS 6.x)
- Debian 5 (nagios3_3.0.6-4~lenny2_i386.deb)
- Fedora 16, 17, 18
- EPEL 6
