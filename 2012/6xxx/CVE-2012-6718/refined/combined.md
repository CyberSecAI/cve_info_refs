### [Suggest to use wp\_enqueue\_style instead of echo for CSS styles](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/suggest-to-use-wp_enqueue_style-instead-of-echo-for-css-styles/)

Hi,
I’ve been using sharebar for long time so far. I’d like to know if you can consider to use the WordPress enqueue features in order to enqueue the required CSS styles, or a filter. So far, I noticed the CSS is inserted using an echo (see here: http://take.ms/s2niu ).
It will be great if you can use wp\_enqueue\_style instead. Why I am asking about this? Because in my case I am trying to do some optimizations and minification of the css/js files and your styles are being added with media=”screen”.
Thank you,
Julian

### [Great plugin, been using for over 5 years without issue!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-plugin-been-using-for-over-5-years-without-issue/)

I am using this with sharethis buttons (over 5 years) and it works really well. All major social media share buttons including: facebook, pinterest, g+, twitter, etc.
By default the social media buttons included with this plugin don’t seem to work, except the facebook like button. I am assuming this is why there are a lot of negative reviews, however, if you use this with sharethis it works great, at least on my theme it did.
There will be some finagling to get it just right on your theme most likely, but with a little css styling you can really get this working and looking good.
