Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6111:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of the `gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync()` function in the `libgnome-keyring` library. When called, this function is intended to lock all keyrings, preventing access to their contents without a password. However, due to a flaw in how the library interacts with the `gnome-keyring-daemon` via D-Bus, the daemon was not actually instructed to discard secrets and lock the keyring, despite the function returning a success status. Specifically, the client library calls the `LockService()` method, which was not properly implemented in the daemon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect implementation of the `LockService()` D-Bus method in `gnome-keyring-daemon`.
- The `gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync()` in `libgnome-keyring` reports successful locking even when the keyring remains unlocked.
- Lack of proper discarding of secrets from memory by gnome-keyring when locked

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Confidentiality breach: Secrets stored in the GNOME keyring remain accessible even after the user or application attempts to lock it via `gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync`. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information like passwords, API keys, etc. if the system is compromised or left unattended while unlocked.
- The documentation and naming of the function imply that the secrets should not be accessible when locked which is not true.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to a system where a keyring is unlocked.
- Exploitation would likely require a malicious actor to already have some level of access to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to a user's session where the GNOME keyring is unlocked. They do not need any special privileges, but need some level of access to the system.
- No network access is required, making this a local vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability affects systems running versions of GNOME that utilize D-Bus for communication between `libgnome-keyring` and `gnome-keyring-daemon`, specifically versions from 2.30 onwards.
- The issue was introduced with the transition from socket-based communication to D-Bus.
- `gnome-power-manager` in GNOME 2.32, and potentially other applications, used this function to attempt to lock the keyring before sleep/hibernate.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2012-6111, and a fix has been implemented in later versions of `libgnome-keyring`.
- The issue is considered moderate severity.
-  `libsecret` is meant to replace `libgnome-keyring`.
- It's noted that in some cases there is no practical impact as most applications do not make use of the `gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync` function.
- Some Linux distributions have patched this vulnerability by fixing the `LockService` method.
