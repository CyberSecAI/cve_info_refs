| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=690466#c0)  bhull2010    2012-12-19 00:00:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 231849](attachment.cgi?id=231849 "Example program to lock gnome keyring") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=231849&action=edit "Example program to lock gnome keyring") Example program to lock gnome keyring  When I call gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync() from a program, GNOME_KEYRING_RESULT_OK is returned, but the keyring is not locked.  Looking at the source code for the daemon, the problem appears to be here: <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-keyring/tree/daemon/dbus/gkd-secret-service.c#n486>  The library calls this service here: <http://git.gnome.org/browse/libgnome-keyring/tree/library/gnome-keyring.c#n871>  This method (LockService) does not appear in the freedesktop secret service api.   Steps to Reproduce: I have attached a sample program that tests this: Compile: gcc locktest.c -o locktest [followed by the output of 'pkg-config --libs --cflags gnome-keyring-1']  Open seahorse and unlock a keyring. Then run the program that should lock the keyring. After reopening seahorse, the keyring is still unlocked.  Actual Results: The keyring remains unlocked.  Expected Results: The keyring is locked after the function call.  Platform: I have tested this on Ubuntu 12.04 (gnome-keyring 3.2), Fedora 17 (gnome-keyring 3.4), and CentOS 6.3 (GNOME 2.28). It works properly on CentOS, but does not lock on Ubuntu and Fedora. The change (from socket to DBus) seems to have been made in 2.30.  Additional Information: I did find a method that works to lock the keyring: <https://github.com/nougad/ruby-dbus-gnome-keyring-playground/blob/master/lock-keyring.rb> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=690466#c1)  Michael Gilbert    2013-04-08 00:39:46 UTC  ``` This was assigned a security identifier (CVE-2012-6111): <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/01/11/5> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=690466#c2)  Matthias Clasen    2013-04-08 11:15:13 UTC  ``` do we know of any applications that use this api ? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=690466#c3)  Stef Walter    2013-04-09 08:26:13 UTC  ``` Can't find any in GNOME.

Subject: libgnome-keyring0: gnome\_keyring\_lock\_all\_sync() doesn't lock the GNOME
keyring
Date: Wed, 09 Jan 2013 20:07:24 -0500
```
Package: libgnome-keyring0
Version: 2.30.1-1
Severity: important

Tags: security

If a program calls the function gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync(), the GNOME
keyring does not lock. This function is used by gnome-power-manager (in
squeeze) when hibernating (or suspending as well if the appropriate gconf key
is set).

I previously reported it at:
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=690466>
but I have not recieved any replies in that bug report yet.

Basically, the library calls the dbus method LockService() on the gnome-keyring
daemon, but that method does nothing (as I mentioned in the GNOME bug report).

To fix this, libgnome-keyring would need modified to call appropriate dbus
methods that actually lock the keyring, or gnome-keyring-daemon would need the
LockService() dbus method implemented (to lock the keyring instead of only
claiming that it locked it).

## Notes

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

In hardy, gnome\_keyring\_lock\_all\_sync() was in the gnome-keyring
package, and works as expected.
In 2.30+ in Lucid+, gnome\_keyring\_lock\_all\_sync() is in
libgnome-keyring and sends a LockService DBus call to
gnome-keyring. This call isn't implemented in lucid+
Nothing in the archive in Oneiric+ actually uses
gnome\_keyring\_lock\_all\_sync(), so this is low.
In Lucid, gnome-power-manager calls this before suspend and
hibernation with the intention of locking the keyring.
Fixing this in Lucid would result in the user likely having to
retype their keyring password when coming out of suspend and
hibernation, which is an intrusive change this late in Lucid's
lifecycle.
Setting this issue as priority low for the reasons above.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

### [CVEProject/cve-schema](/CVEProject/cve-schema)[Support PURL as identifier](/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/173)

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.
