## Synopsis

Important: puppet security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0710)

## Topic

Updated puppet packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat OpenStack Folsom.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Puppet allows provisioning, patching, and configuration of clients to be
managed and automated.

A flaw was found in how Puppet handled certain HTTP PUT requests. An
attacker with valid authentication credentials, and authorized to save to
the authenticated client's own report, could construct a malicious request
that could possibly cause the Puppet master to execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2013-2274)

A flaw was found in how Puppet handled the "template" and "inline\_template"
functions during catalog compilation. If an authenticated attacker were to
requests its catalog from the Puppet master, it could possibly result in
arbitrary code execution when the catalog is compiled. (CVE-2013-1640)

A flaw was found in how Puppet handled certain HTTP GET requests. An
attacker with valid authentication credentials could construct a request to
retrieve catalogs from the Puppet master that they are not authorized to
access. (CVE-2013-1652)

It was found that the default /etc/puppet/auth.conf configuration file
allowed an authenticated node to submit a report for any other node, which
could breach compliance requirements. (CVE-2013-2275)

It was found that the /var/log/puppet directory was created world-readable.
This could allow local users to obtain sensitive information from the
Puppet log files. (CVE-2012-6120)

It was found that Puppet allowed the use of the SSLv2 protocol. A Puppet
agent could use this to negotiate the use of the weak SSLv2 protocol for
its connection to a Puppet master. (CVE-2013-1654)

Red Hat would like to thank Puppet Labs for reporting CVE-2013-1640,
CVE-2013-1652, CVE-2013-1654, CVE-2013-2274, and CVE-2013-2275.

Note: In most default configurations these issues are not directly
exploitable unless the attacker has access to the underlying OpenStack
infrastructure (e.g. shell access to a Nova compute node).

Users of Red Hat OpenStack Folsom are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which upgrade Puppet to version 2.6.18 and correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

A recent update and build without change to the spec file shows that /var/log/puppet now retains the proper permissions.  I don't seem to have any access to the blocker bugs, so I don't know what the security team wants to do about closing this out.  Please advise or close as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=908629#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-03-21 06:25:06 UTC  ``` The blocker bugs and depends on bugs are for Red Hat internal purposes, a tracking bug for EPEL was created (908915) and you were assigned to it, and it was closed properly so that's all you need to worry about on your side. Basically SRT handles closing of all CVE bugs (like this one).   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=908629#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-04-04 20:20:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    OpenStack Folsom for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0710 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0710.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=908629#c12)  Kurt Seifried    2013-07-26 06:21:52 UTC  ``` The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact in CloudForms 1.1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=919770#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-03-10 01:38:09 UTC  ``` Moses Mendoza (moses) reports:  [CVE-2013-1654](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1654) - Protocol downgrade * Resolved in Puppet 2.6.18, 2.7.21, 3.1.1, Puppet Enterprise 1.2.7, 2.7.2  Affects puppet master and agents at least as far back as 0.24.0, likely earlier, but only if using a version of openssl that is compiled with SSLv2 support enabled. A vulnerable system will report:  $ ruby -e "require 'openssl'; puts OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext::METHODS" Show quoted text SSLv2  A bug in Puppet allows SSL connections to be downgraded to SSLv2, which is known to contain design flaw weaknesses (<http://osvdb.org/56387>). This affects SSL connections between  puppet agents and master, as well as connections that puppet agents make to third party servers that accept SSLv2 connections. This is only an issue on systems that use an older version of openssl, as newer versions explicitly disable SSLv2 support.
