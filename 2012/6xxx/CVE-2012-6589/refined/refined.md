Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-6589:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper input sanitization in the Myrephp Business Directory application, specifically in `links.php` and `search.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   Vulnerable file: `links.php`
    *   The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `cat` parameter.
    *   Attack vector: Malicious SQL code injected into the `cat` parameter.
    *   Example: `http://localhost/path/links.php?cat=1'[Insert Query]`

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Vulnerable file: `search.php`
    *   The application is vulnerable to XSS through the `look` parameter.
    *   Attack vector: Malicious JavaScript injected into the `look` parameter.
    *   Example: `http:localhost/path/search.php?keywords1=&keywords2=&look=%27%20onmouseover%3dprompt%28945724%29%20bad%3d%27&nolinks1=10&order=city&page=2&sort=ASC`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   They could read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
    *   In some cases, the attacker might be able to gain control of the server hosting the application.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
    *   This could lead to cookie stealing, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   The attacker could also deface the website or inject malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Manipulating the `cat` parameter in the `links.php` URL.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Manipulating the `look` parameter in the `search.php` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   For SQL Injection, knowledge of SQL syntax is required.
*   For XSS, knowledge of JavaScript is required to craft malicious payloads.
*   The attacker can be remote and does not require any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry also mentions CVE-2012-6588 which seems to relate to the same software and vulnerabilities.
