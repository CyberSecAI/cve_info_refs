Message-ID: <50DEFA09.7040403@larpwiki.de>

From: Tilmann Haak <tilmann@...pwiki.de>

Subject: CVE request: MoinMoin Wiki (remote code execution vulnerability)

Hi all,

there is a remote code execution vulnerability in MoinMoin wiki,
versions 1.9.x up to (and including) 1.9.5. The method save in class
AnyWikiDraw (action/anywikidraw.py) and class TWikiDraw
(action/twikidraw.py) do not filter user supplied input correctly, which
leads to a path traversal vulnerability, which can be exploited to
execute arbitrary code with moin's privileges. An exploit was seen in
the wild.

Details can be found at: <http://moinmo.in/SecurityFixes>

A fix is available at: <http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.9/rev/7e7e1cbb9d3f>

Could someone please assign a CVE number?

kind regards,
   Tilmann

```

# 1.9.10 release infos

Security fixes, some new features, bundled software updates.

For details see the [CHANGES file](https://github.com/moinwiki/moin-1.9/blob/1.9.10/docs/CHANGES).

# 1.9.9 release infos

Security fixes, some new features, bundled software updates.

For details see the [CHANGES file](http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.9/file/1.9.9/docs/CHANGES).

# 1.9.8 release infos

Lots of small new features, bug fixes, performance improvements.

For details see the [CHANGES file](http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.9/file/1.9.8/docs/CHANGES).

# 1.9.7 release infos

Lots of password-related enhancements (using much stronger hashes, password reset functionality greatly enhanced).

Fixed some minor bugs.

For details see the [CHANGES file](http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.9/file/1.9.7/docs/CHANGES).

# 1.9.6 release infos

Fixed serious security issues, one minor other fix.

# Some 1.9.5 pre release infos

We'll release moin 1.9.5 at some time to bring out the next bunch of small bugfixes and translation updates.

With the recent translation updates there is a problem still: some of these updates need a check by a native speaker whether they are good translation quality.

So, if you are a native (or equivalent) speaker of some non-English language, please check <http://master19.moinmo.in/MoinI18n> - there is a list of wiki pages holding our master copies of the po files. E.g. <http://master19.moinmo.in/MoinI18n/de> is for "de" (German).

The checking procedure should especially look at the updates done between November 2010 and January 2011 (click on "Info" to see the history). If you find updates that look like output from some automated translation tool/service rather than good human translation work, then please contact us (e.g. via [MoinMoinChat](/MoinMoinChat) or contact [ThomasWaldmann](/ThomasWaldmann)).

Aside from that checking work, it would be also nice if your favourite translation is in a good state (rather complete, no fuzzy strings, etc.).

If you like, you can edit the translations directly on the [master19 wiki](http://master19.moinmo.in/) after creating a user account there and adding your user name to [MoinPagesEditorGroup](http://master19.moinmo.in/MoinPagesEditorGroup) page.

Thanks for helping!

# USN-1680-1: MoinMoin vulnerabilities

30 December 2012

MoinMoin could be made to run programs and overwrite files.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [moin](/security/cves?package=moin) - Collaborative hypertext environment

## Details

It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input when

processing AnyWikiDraw and TWikiDraw actions. A remote attacker with write

access could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files and execute

arbitrary code with the priviliges of the web server (user 'www-data').

It was discovered that MoinMoin also did not properly sanitize its input

when processing the AttachFile action. A remote attacker could exploit

this to overwrite files via directory traversal.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
