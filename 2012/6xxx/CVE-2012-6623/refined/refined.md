The provided content relates to CVE-2012-6623. The provided information comes from a WordPress plugin page, a code repository, and a security research page, all of which discuss the same vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization and casting of user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the plugin directly uses values from $_GET and $_POST arrays without ensuring they are integers, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code uses unsanitized input in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- The code uses `~~` as a string delimiter within the SQL query, and that seems unusual.
- In `fs-admin/fs-admin.php`,  the `DELETE` queries for usergroups and users in usergroups does not sanitize the input.
- In `fs-admin/fs-admin.php`, the `DELETE` query for removing a member from usergroup does not sanitize the `groupid`.
- In `fs-admin/fs-admin.php`, the `UPDATE` query for updating the usergroups of a forum group does not sanitize the `group_id` variable.
- In `fs-admin/fs-admin.php`, the `SELECT` query for retrieving usergroups with access to a group does not sanitize the `groupid`.
- In `fs-admin/wpf-add-forum.php`, the hidden input for `add_forum_group_id` does not sanitize the `groupid`.
- In `fs-admin/wpf-edit-forum-group.php`, the `textarea` to edit the description does not sanitize the groupid.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user information, forum content, and plugin configurations.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker can modify or delete data within the forum, leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker may be able to escalate their privileges within the forum or even the WordPress site, depending on the database user permissions.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can disrupt the forum's functionality or even the entire WordPress site.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious HTTP GET parameters.
- Malicious HTTP POST parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- No specific position or privilege is required to exploit this vulnerability, making it remotely exploitable.
