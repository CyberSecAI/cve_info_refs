### [Died on the vine?](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/died-on-the-vine/)

[sfdennis1948](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sfdennis1948/ "Posts by sfdennis1948")

After doing some research, this plugin – WP Forum Server – seems to be one that has “died on the vine”… Too bad WordPress has so many plugins, such as this one, that need to be removed from their listings… Something that should have happened a long, long time ago…
The website links for this plugin at vasthtml dot com, be it for /support or /contact only lead to a “404” page… forumpress dot org only leads you back to the WordPress page for plugin WP Forum Server…
Bottom line: adopt and update the plugin or don’t bother using it at all…

this plugin interacts with the built-in registration and user system of wordpress making it a good choice for many websites. It also takes most of its css from your wordpress theme, so it adapts to the theme somewhat.

I’m glad I tried this plugin even though it had one “not working” review. Worked flawlessly for me.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
