Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that blog posts were still accessible through the blog's RSS feed even after the blogging feature was disabled globally. This indicates a flaw in how Moodle handled access controls for RSS feeds when the blogging feature was turned off.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leak: The core issue is an information leak where blog content intended to be private (due to the global disabling of blogging) was still accessible.
- Insufficient Access Control: The system failed to properly restrict access to the RSS feed based on the global blogging setting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to blog content. This could include potentially sensitive or private information that users did not intend to be publicly available when the blogging feature was disabled. The risk is described as "Minor".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by accessing the RSS feed for the blog. The RSS feed was accessible via a URL, and an attacker could retrieve the blog posts through this feed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs no specific capabilities other than the ability to access the blog RSS feed URL.
- They do not need to be logged into the Moodle instance, since the vulnerability existed even with globally disabled blogs.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is tracked as MDL-37467 in the Moodle tracker.
- The vulnerability was reported by David Mudrak.
- Affected versions include Moodle 2.4, 2.3 to 2.3.3+, 2.2 to 2.2.6+, and 2.1 to 2.1.9+.
- A fix was implemented, and a commit was made: [http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=MDL-37467](http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=MDL-37467)
- A workaround mentioned is to disable blogging completely.
