Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `git-effort` and `git-changelog` scripts within the `git-extras` package create temporary files in the `/tmp` directory using a predictable filename (`/tmp/.git-effort`). This predictability makes them vulnerable to symlink attacks and race conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Temporary File Creation:** The scripts use a hardcoded filename, making it easy for an attacker to predict the file path.
*   **Race Condition:**  Multiple users running the scripts concurrently might interfere with each other as they attempt to use the same temporary file.
*   **Symlink Attack:** An attacker can create a symbolic link at the expected temporary file location, pointing to a different file. When the vulnerable script attempts to write data to the temporary file, it will unintentionally write data to the location pointed by the symlink, which could potentially overwrite or corrupt sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Corruption:** By leveraging the predictable filename and symlink attack, an attacker can potentially overwrite or corrupt any file on the system that the user running the vulnerable script has write permissions to.
*   **Denial of Service:** Overwriting critical system files could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
*  **Information disclosure:** Overwriting a file with sensitive data could lead to disclosure of information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable `git-extras` scripts are installed.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a symbolic link in the `/tmp` directory with the predictable filename used by the scripts.
*   **Race condition:** The attacker can create a race condition to ensure their symlink is created before the program attempts to create the same file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `git-extras` is installed.
*  The attacker needs to be able to write files to /tmp
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create symbolic links.

**Mitigation:**

* The vulnerability was fixed by using the `mktemp` command to create temporary files with unique names. The patch also ensures that the temporary file is removed after it is used, using a `trap` command.
