| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1402024#c0)  Adam Mariš    2016-12-06 15:21:32 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of setsockopt for the SO_{SND|RCV}BUF setsockopt() system call.  Users with non-namespace CAP_NET_ADMIN are able to trigger this call and create a situation in which the sockets sendbuff data size could be negative.    This could adversely affect memory allocations and create situations where the system could crash or cause memory corruption.  This situation affects SO_SNDBUFF and SO_RCVBUFF similarly as shown in [CVE-2016-9793](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-9793).  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/82981930125abfd39d7c8378a9cfdf5e1be2002b>  CVE assignment:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/574>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1402024#c2)  Wade Mealing    2017-01-12 06:05:21 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the kernels as shipping with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, MRG-2 and realtime.   ``` |  |

Use CVE-2016-9793. This affects, for example, 4.8.12.

We might not completely understand the CVE implications of the "Note
that before
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/82981930125abfd39d7c8378a9cfdf5e1be2002b>
the bug was even more serious, since SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF were
vulnerable" comment within the
b98b0bc8c431e3ceb4b26b0dfc8db509518fb290 commit message.
82981930125abfd39d7c8378a9cfdf5e1be2002b is a commit from 2012. The
3.5 release has this, whereas the 3.4 release does not.

For now, we are assigning CVE-2012-6704 to mean the analogous
vulnerability involving SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF that affects "before
3.5" kernels.
