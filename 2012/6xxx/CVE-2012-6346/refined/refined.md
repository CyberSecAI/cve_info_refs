- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Regular Expression - Validation module of FortiWeb, specifically within the `pcre_expression/validate` functionality. The `redir` and `mkey` parameters are not properly sanitized, allowing the injection of malicious script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Non-persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `redir` and `mkey` parameters, allowing the injection of arbitrary client-side script.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to hijack user sessions, potentially stealing user credentials, performing client-side phishing attacks, and manipulating client-side application module context.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited remotely by crafting malicious URLs that include script code within the `redir` and `mkey` parameters. The attacker can entice a user to click on the crafted URL or otherwise cause the user's browser to send the crafted request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not require a privileged user account on the FortiWeb appliance. Medium user interaction is required to entice a user to send the crafted request.
