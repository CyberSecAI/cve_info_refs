# Active Record: SQL injection — GLSA **201401-22**

A vulnerability in Active Record could allow a remote attacker to
inject SQL commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-ruby/activerecord** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.3.14-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3.14-r1** |

### Background

Active Record is a Ruby gem that allows database entries to be
manipulated as objects.

### Description

An Active Record method parameter can mistakenly be used as a scope.

### Impact

A remote attacker could use specially crafted input to execute arbitrary
SQL statements.

### Workaround

The vulnerability may be mitigated by converting the input to an
expected value. This is accomplished by changing instances of
‘Post.find\_by\_id(params[:id])’ in code using Active Record to
‘Post.find\_by\_id(params[:id].to\_s)’

### Resolution

All Active Record users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-ruby/activerecord-2.3.14-r1"

```

There is a SQL injection vulnerability in Active Record in ALL versions. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2012-5664.

Versions Affected: All.

Not affected: NONE.

Fixed Versions: 3.2.10, 3.1.9, 3.0.18

Impact

------

Due to the way dynamic finders in Active Record extract options from method parameters, a method parameter can mistakenly be used as a scope. Carefully crafted requests can use the scope to inject arbitrary SQL.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.

Impacted code passes user provided data to a dynamic finder like this:

 Post.find\_by\_id(params[:id])

Releases

--------

The 3.2.10, 3.1.9 & 3.0.18 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds

-----------

The issue can be mitigated by explicitly converting the parameter to an expected value. For example, change this:

 Post.find\_by\_id(params[:id])

to this:

 Post.find\_by\_id(params[:id].to\_s)

Patches

-------

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series and two unsupported versions. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

\* 3-2-dynamic\_finder\_injection.patch - Patch for 3.2 series

\* 3-1-dynamic\_finder\_injection.patch - Patch for 3.1 series

\* 3-0-dynamic\_finder\_injection.patch - Patch for 3.0 series

\* 2-3-dynamic\_finder\_injection.patch - Patch for 2.3 series

Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 17:03:56 UTC  ``` Hi!  Python distutils (i.e. setup.py) appears to do extensive probing of the python installation when installing python modules.  This results in many "apparent" sandbox (v0.2.2) violations when trying to merge a python module.    This appears to be the case for all python modules that use distutils to install (although I have only confirmed for gnome-python, PyXML, and Numeric so far) and is true for a python-2.1.1 and python-2.2 installation.  I haven't tested against python-2.0  I believe this is related to setup.py running automake to generate Makefile's and calling some python code in the aclocal.m4 and acinclude.m4 files located in the top directory of the modules source tree.  Unfortunately, I can't offer a solution at this time.  But I will attach a couple example sandbox.logs to illustrate the problem.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 17:05:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 24](attachment.cgi?id=24 "sandbox-PyXML-0.6.6-12713.log") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=24&action=edit "sandbox-PyXML-0.6.6-12713.log")] sandbox-PyXML-0.6.6-12713.log ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 17:05:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 25](attachment.cgi?id=25 "sandbox-gnome-python-1.4.1-r3-4971.log") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=25&action=edit "sandbox-gnome-python-1.4.1-r3-4971.log")] sandbox-gnome-python-1.4.1-r3-4971.log ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-05 17:06:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 26](attachment.cgi?id=26 "sandbox-Numeric-20.3-5079.log") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=26&action=edit "sandbox-Numeric-20.3-5079.log")] sandbox-Numeric-20.3-5079.log ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-14 13:21:51 UTC  ``` I might work to try this by setting the SANDBOX_PREDICT variable. This prevents write outside the allowed dirs, but doesn't make the sandbox to consider this as errors. I don't know however if this doesn't interfere with the correct workings of the python check. To make it easy, you can just use the 'addpredict' bach function in your ebuild. If you're sure that it doesn't 'cause any unwanted behaviour, I could add it to the default sandbox settings. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-15 06:44:52 UTC  ``` I added the SANDBOX_PREDICT var entries and it seems to work well. All packages compile and the few I tested ran well (XChat, 4Suite). Also integrating it into portage 1.8.5-r2 ``` |  |

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service
(PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Refer to the Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 Release Notes for information
about the changes in this release. The Release Notes will be available
shortly from <https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/>

This update also fixes the following security issues:

It was found that the master cryptographic key of Jenkins could be
retrieved via the HTTP server that is hosting Jenkins. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to access the server and execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Jenkins. Note that this issue only
affected Jenkins instances that had slaves attached and that also allowed
anonymous read access (not the default configuration). Manual action is
also required to correct this issue. Refer to "Jenkins Security Advisory
2013-01-04", linked to in the References, for further information.
(CVE-2013-0158)

When the rhc-chk script was run in debug mode, its output included
sensitive information, such as database passwords, in plain text. As this
script is commonly used when troubleshooting, this flaw could lead to users
unintentionally exposing sensitive information in support channels (for
example, a Bugzilla report). This update removes the rhc-chk script.
(CVE-2012-5658)

Multiple flaws in the Jenkins web interface could allow a remote attacker
to perform HTTP response splitting and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks,
as well as redirecting a victim to an arbitrary page by utilizing an open
redirect flaw. (CVE-2012-6072, CVE-2012-6074, CVE-2012-6073)

A flaw was found in the way rubygem-activerecord dynamic finders extracted
options from method parameters. A remote attacker could possibly use this
flaw to perform SQL injection attacks against applications using the Active
Record dynamic finder methods. (CVE-2012-6496)

The openshift-port-proxy-cfg program created a temporary file in an
insecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic
link attack, overwriting an arbitrary file accessible to the root user with
a "0" or a "1", which could lead to a denial of service. By default,
OpenShift uses polyinstantiation (per user) for the /tmp/ directory,
minimizing the risk of exploitation by local attackers. (CVE-2013-0164)

The CVE-2013-0164 issue was discovered by Michael Scherer of the Red Hat
Regional IT team.

Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.0 are advised to upgrade to Red Hat
OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=889649#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-12-22 07:43:27 UTC  ```  This issue was found on the Phenoelit Blog:  An authlogic cookie usually uses a database stored token to identify the user. The relevant parts of the session cookie are:      user_credentials_id - a numeric value which is used with "User.find_by_id()"     user_credentials - a radom string which will be compared with the database field "persistence_token" in the Users table  Due to the way the RoR "find_by_*" methods are defined the following SQL injection a-like issue arises:  > User.find_by_id({:select =>"* from users limit 1 --"})   User Load (0.5ms)  SELECT * from users limit 1 -- FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" IS NULL LIMIT 1  => #<User id: 1, [... all the fun stuff]  By knowing this behaviour we can now easily circumvent the authlogic protection with the knowledge of the "secret_token". The following cookie would give you access to an authlogic protected application:  {    "session_id" => "41414141",    "user_credentials"=>"Phenoelit",   "user_credentials_id"=>{      :select=> " *,\"Phenoelit\" as persistence_token from Users -- "   } }  Last man standing would then be devise/warden, which works similar to authlogic but is not exploitable in that way described above.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2012-5664](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5664).  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       NONE. Fixed Versions:     3.2.10, 3.1.9, 3.0.18  Impact ------ Due to the way dynamic finders in Active Record extract options from method parameters, a method parameter can mistakenly be used as a scope.  Carefully crafted requests can use the scope to inject arbitrary SQL.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  Impacted code passes user provided data to a dynamic finder like this:    Post.find_by_id(params[:id])  Releases -------- The  3.2.10, 3.1.9 & 3.0.18 releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- The issue can be mitigated by explicitly converting the parameter to an expected value.  For example, change this:    Post.find_by_id(params[:id])  to this:    Post.find_by_id(params[:id].to_s)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=889649#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-03 03:28:24 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-rails tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 891468](show_bug.cgi?id=891468 "CLOSED ERRATA -

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 05:24:45 UTC  ```  Damien Mathieu (42) reports:  Unsafe Query Generation Risk in Ruby on Rails  There is a vulnerability when Active Record is used in conjunction with JSON  parameter parsing. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  [CVE-2013-0155](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0155).  Versions Affected:  3.x series Not affected:       2.x series Fixed Versions:     3.2.11, 3.1.10, 3.0.19  Impact ------  Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way that JSON parameters are parsed, it is possible for an attacker to issue  unexpected database queries with "IS NULL" or empty where clauses.  This issue  does *not* let an attacker insert arbitrary values into an SQL query, however  they can cause the query to check for NULL or eliminate a WHERE clause when  most users wouldn't expect it.  For example, a system has password reset with token functionality:      unless params[:token].nil?       user = User.find_by_token(params[:token])       user.reset_password!     end  An attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will return `[nil]`. The `[nil]` value will bypass the test for nil, but will still add an  "IN ('xyz', NULL)" clause to the SQL query.  Similarly, an attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will  return an empty hash.  An empty hash will eliminate the WHERE clause of the  query, but can bypass the `nil?` check.  Note that this impacts not only dynamic finders (`find_by_*`) but also  relations (`User.where(:name => params[:name])`).  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the  work arounds immediately. All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately. Please note, this vulnerability is a variant of [CVE-2012-2660](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2660),  and [CVE-2012-2694](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2694).  Even if you upgraded to address those issues, you must  take action again.  If this chance in behavior impacts your application, you can manually decode  the original values from the request like so:      ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(request.body)  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- This problem can be mitigated by casting the parameter to a string before  passing it to Active Record.  For example:      unless params[:token].nil? || params[:token].to_s.empty?       user = User.find_by_token(params[:token].to_s)       user.reset_password!     end An attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will return `[nil]`. The `[nil]` value will bypass the test for nil, but will still add an  "IN ('xyz', NULL)" clause to the SQL query.  Similarly, an attacker can craft a request such that `params[:token]` will  return an empty hash.  An empty hash will eliminate the WHERE clause of the  query, but can bypass the `nil?` check.  Note that this impacts not only dynamic finders (`find_by_*`) but also  relations (`User.where(:name => params[:name])`).  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the  work arounds immediately. All users running an affected release should upgrade immediately. Please note, this vulnerability is a variant of [CVE-2012-2660](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2660),  and [CVE-2012-2694](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2694).  Even if you upgraded to address those issues, you must  take action again.  If this chance in behavior impacts your application, you can manually decode  the original values from the request like so:      ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(request.body)  Releases -------- The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- This problem can be mitigated by casting the parameter to a string before  passing it to Active Record.  For example:      unless params[:token].nil? || params[:token].to_s.empty?       user = User.find_by_token(params[:token].to_s)       user.reset_password!     end  Note the parameter is still cast to a string before being sent to Active  Record. This is because an array with a nil value can still bypass the  `to_s.empty?` test:      >> ['xyz', nil].to_s     => "xyz"     >> ['xyz', nil].to_s.empty?     => false   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 06:01:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 674505](attachment.cgi?id=674505&action=diff "actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-0-null_array_param.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=674505&action=edit "actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-0-null_array_param.patch") actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-0-null_array_param.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 06:02:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 674506](attachment.cgi?id=674506&action=diff "actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-1-null_array_param.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=674506&action=edit "actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-1-null_array_param.patch") actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-1-null_array_param.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 06:02:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 674507](attachment.cgi?id=674507&action=diff "actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-2-null_array_param.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=674507&action=edit "actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-2-null_array_param.patch") actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-2-null_array_param.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 06:02:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 674508](attachment.cgi?id=674508&action=diff "actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-2-unsafe_query.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=674508&action=edit "actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-2-unsafe_query.patch") actionpack-CVE-2012-0155-3-2-unsafe_query.patch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c9)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 21:24:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 675073](attachment.cgi?id=675073&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=675073&action=edit) actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-2-unsafe_query.patch   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c10)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 21:24:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 675074](attachment.cgi?id=675074&action=diff "actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-0-null_array_param.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=675074&action=edit "actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-0-null_array_param.patch") actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-0-null_array_param.patch   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c11)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 21:25:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 675075](attachment.cgi?id=675075&action=diff "actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-1-null_array_param.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=675075&action=edit "actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-1-null_array_param.patch") actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-1-null_array_param.patch   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c12)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-08 21:25:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 675076](attachment.cgi?id=675076&action=diff "actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-2-null_array_param.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=675076&action=edit "actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-2-null_array_param.patch") actionpack-CVE-2013-0155-3-2-null_array_param.patch   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c13)  Vincent Danen    2013-01-09 02:20:59 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-actionpack tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 893281](show_bug.cgi?id=893281 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2013-0155 CVE-2013-0156 rubygem-actionpack various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c14)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-09 06:37:26 UTC  ``` The upstream report:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/t1WFuuQyavI>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2013-01-09 12:46:55 UTC  ``` The fix for this issue was reported to introduce a regression:  <https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/8832>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-10 20:42:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.1  Via RHSA-2013:0154 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0154.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-10 22:41:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    CloudForms for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0155 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0155.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=892866#c19)  Fedora Update System    2013-01-20 03:40:20 UTC  ``` rubygem-actionpack-3.2.8-2.fc18, rubygem-activerecord-3.2.8-3.fc18, rubygem-activesupport-3.2.8-2.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=890607#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-12-28 05:49:05 UTC  ```  Jenkins Security Advisory 2012-11-20  The first vulnerability is commonly known as HTTP response splitting  vulnerability, which can act as a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This  allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages served by  Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his privileges by  hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack, the attacker needs  to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation. This vulnerability  affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in servlet container (this  includes all the native packages.)  Fix: Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.491 LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.1  External URLs: [https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2012-11-20](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2012-11-20) <http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-advisory/jenkins-security-advisory-2012-11-20.cb>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=890607#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-31 20:34:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEL 6 Version of OpenShift Enterprise  Via RHSA-2013:0220 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0220.html>   ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0154)

## Topic

Updated rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord
packages that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat
Subscription Asset Manager.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view
components. Active Record implements object-relational mapping for
accessing database entries using objects. Active Support provides support
and utility classes used by the Ruby on Rails framework.

Multiple flaws were found in the way Ruby on Rails performed XML parameter
parsing in HTTP requests. A remote attacker could use these flaws to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a Ruby on Rails application,
perform SQL injection attacks, or bypass the authentication using a
specially-created HTTP request. (CVE-2013-0156)

Red Hat is aware that a public exploit for the CVE-2013-0156 issues is
available that allows remote code execution in applications using Ruby on
Rails.

Multiple input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in
rubygem-activerecord. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to
perform an SQL injection attack against an application using
rubygem-activerecord. (CVE-2012-2661, CVE-2012-2695, CVE-2012-6496,
CVE-2013-0155)

Multiple input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in
rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to
perform an SQL injection attack against an application using
rubygem-actionpack and rubygem-activerecord. (CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in rubygem-actionpack.
A remote attacker could use these flaws to conduct XSS attacks against
users of an application using rubygem-actionpack. (CVE-2012-3463,
CVE-2012-3464, CVE-2012-3465)

A flaw was found in the HTTP digest authentication implementation in
rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
denial of service of an application using rubygem-actionpack and digest
authentication. (CVE-2012-3424)

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated rubygem-actionpack,
rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord packages, which resolve
these issues. Katello must be restarted ("service katello restart") for
this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=847200#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-08-10 05:17:49 UTC  ```  The Ruby on Rails project reports:  XSS Vulnerability in strip_tags  There is a vulnerability in the strip_tags helper of Ruby on Rails which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2012-3465](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3465).  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       Applications not using strip_tags Fixed Versions:     3.2.8, 3.1.8, 3.0.17  Impact - ------ There is an XSS vulnerability in the strip_tags helper in Ruby on Rails, the helper doesn't correctly handle malformed html.  As a result an attacker can execute arbitrary javascript through the use of specially crafted malformed html.  All users who rely on strip_tags for XSS protection should upgrade or use the work around immediately.  Releases - -------- The 3.2.8 and 3.1.8 releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds - ----------- For users running earlier releases we have provided a work around, place the attached file into the config/initializers directory of your application.  Patches - ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-0-strip_tags.patch - Patch for 3.0 series * 3-1-strip_tags.patch - Patch for 3.1 series * 3-2-strip_tags.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.  Credits - -------  Thanks to Marek from Nethemba (www.nethemba.com) for reporting this issue!  ---  References: <http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/8/9/ann-rails-3-2-8-has-been-released/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=847200#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2012-08-10 05:23:42 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-actionpack tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 847201](show_bug.cgi?id=847201 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-3463 CVE-2012-3464 CVE-2012-3465 rubygem-actionpack various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=847200#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-08-10 05:25:03 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-actionpack tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 847202](show_bug.cgi?id=847202 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-3463 CVE-2012-3464 CVE-2012-3465 CVE-2013-0156 rubygem-actionpack various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=847200#c5)  Fedora Update System    2012-08-22 20:58:50 UTC  ``` rubygem-actionpack-3.0.10-9.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=889649#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-12-22 07:43:27 UTC  ```  This issue was found on the Phenoelit Blog:  An authlogic cookie usually uses a database stored token to identify the user. The relevant parts of the session cookie are:      user_credentials_id - a numeric value which is used with "User.find_by_id()"     user_credentials - a radom string which will be compared with the database field "persistence_token" in the Users table  Due to the way the RoR "find_by_*" methods are defined the following SQL injection a-like issue arises:  > User.find_by_id({:select =>"* from users limit 1 --"})   User Load (0.5ms)  SELECT * from users limit 1 -- FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" IS NULL LIMIT 1  => #<User id: 1, [... all the fun stuff]  By knowing this behaviour we can now easily circumvent the authlogic protection with the knowledge of the "secret_token". The following cookie would give you access to an authlogic protected application:  {    "session_id" => "41414141",    "user_credentials"=>"Phenoelit",   "user_credentials_id"=>{      :select=> " *,\"Phenoelit\" as persistence_token from Users -- "   } }  Last man standing would then be devise/warden, which works similar to authlogic but is not exploitable in that way described above.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2012-5664](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5664).  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       NONE. Fixed Versions:     3.2.10, 3.1.9, 3.0.18  Impact ------ Due to the way dynamic finders in Active Record extract options from method parameters, a method parameter can mistakenly be used as a scope.  Carefully crafted requests can use the scope to inject arbitrary SQL.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  Impacted code passes user provided data to a dynamic finder like this:    Post.find_by_id(params[:id])  Releases -------- The  3.2.10, 3.1.9 & 3.0.18 releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- The issue can be mitigated by explicitly converting the parameter to an expected value.

## Synopsis

Important: Subscription Asset Manager 1.2 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0544)

## Topic

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.2, which fixes several security
issues, multiple bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

[Updated 25th February 2013]
This erratum previously failed to include the updated rubygem-rack package.
It also previously incorrectly documented CVE-2012-5604 as being fixed,
however that issue never affected Subscription Asset Manager and is no
longer listed. As well, CVE-2012-6496 was described as being fixed, however
that issue had previously been fixed in RHSA-2013:0154.

## Description

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager acts as a proxy for handling
subscription information and software updates on client machines.

It was discovered that Katello did not properly check user permissions when
handling certain requests. An authenticated remote attacker could use this
flaw to download consumer certificates or change settings of other users'
systems if they knew the target system's UUID. (CVE-2012-5603)

It was found that the
"/usr/share/katello/script/katello-generate-passphrase" utility, which is
run during the installation and configuration process, set world-readable
permissions on the "/etc/katello/secure/passphrase" file. A local attacker
could use this flaw to obtain the passphrase for Katello, giving them
access to information they would otherwise not have access to.
(CVE-2012-5561)

Note: After installing this update, ensure the
"/etc/katello/secure/passphrase" file is owned by the root user and group
and mode 0750 permissions. Sites should also consider re-creating the
Katello passphrase as this issue exposed it to local users.

Three flaws were found in rubygem-rack. A remote attacker could use these
flaws to perform a denial of service attack against applications using
rubygem-rack. (CVE-2012-6109, CVE-2013-0183, CVE-2013-0184)

It was found that ruby\_parser from rubygem-ruby\_parser created a temporary
file in an insecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a
symbolic link attack, overwriting arbitrary files accessible to the
application using ruby\_parser. (CVE-2013-0162)

The CVE-2012-5603 issue was discovered by Lukas Zapletal of Red Hat;
CVE-2012-5561 was discovered by Aaron Weitekamp of the Red Hat Cloud
Quality Engineering team; and CVE-2013-0162 was discovered by Michael
Scherer of the Red Hat Regional IT team.

These updated Subscription Asset Manager packages include a number of bug
fixes and enhancements. Space precludes documenting all of these changes
in this advisory. Refer to the Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.2
Release Notes for information about these changes:

<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Asset_Manager/1.2/html/Release_Notes/index.html>

All users of Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager are advised to upgrade to
these updated packages, which fix these issues and add various
enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
