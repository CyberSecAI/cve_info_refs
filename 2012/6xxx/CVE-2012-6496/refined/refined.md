Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6496:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way dynamic finders in Active Record extract options from method parameters. A method parameter, intended to be a simple identifier, can be mistakenly interpreted as a scope.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection. By providing specially crafted input via a method parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code that gets executed by the database.
*   **Dynamic Finders:** The vulnerability specifically exploits the behavior of "dynamic finders" in Active Record (e.g., `find_by_id`, `find_by_name`), which are intended for simple queries but are susceptible to manipulation.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is a lack of proper input validation or sanitization on the parameters passed to the dynamic finders.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the application's database.
*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information, modify existing data, or even create new database entries depending on the application's database structure and access controls.
*   **Application Compromise:** In severe cases, the vulnerability could lead to full compromise of the application and its associated data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:**  The attack is performed remotely through HTTP requests.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker crafts malicious inputs in parameters passed to dynamic finder methods.
*   **HTTP Parameters:** Attackers exploit the way parameters (often coming from user input, e.g., form fields or URL parameters) are handled by the application and passed to the Active Record dynamic finders.
*   **JSON Parameter Parsing (related):**  In some contexts, particularly when using JSON parameter parsing, arrays containing `nil` values can bypass nil checks, but still result in SQL queries with `IN ('xyz', NULL)` clauses. Also, empty hashes can bypass `nil?` checks and eliminate the `WHERE` clause from the query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of Application Logic:**  The attacker must have some understanding of how the application uses Active Record's dynamic finders and how it processes input parameters.
*   **Crafting Malicious Input:**  The attacker must be capable of crafting specially formatted input that exploits the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Workarounds:** A suggested workaround is to explicitly convert the method parameter to the expected value, e.g. `Post.find_by_id(params[:id].to_s)`, which forces the parameter to a string, preventing interpretation as a SQL scope.
*   **Patches:** Patches were released for affected Ruby on Rails versions (3.2.10, 3.1.9, and 3.0.18) and for specific products relying on these versions, such as Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager.
*   **Related CVEs:** The content also mentions a relationship to CVE-2012-5664 (which was later rejected), and how the issue was subsequently split into two CVEs, one for the SQL injection (CVE-2012-6496) and one for Authlogic related code (CVE-2012-6497).

In summary, CVE-2012-6496 is a significant SQL injection vulnerability within the Active Record component of Ruby on Rails that can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL, requiring awareness of the application's structure and the ability to craft specific HTTP requests. The issue is present in various versions of Ruby on Rails, highlighting the importance of applying the relevant security patches to address this vulnerability.
