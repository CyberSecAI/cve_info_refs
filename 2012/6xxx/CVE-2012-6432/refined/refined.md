Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2012-6432:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Symfony's `FrameworkBundle:Internal:index` controller handles requests via the internal routes `_internal` and `_internal_public`. These routes execute a controller specified as an argument in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted Controller Execution:** The `_internal` and `_internal_public` routes, designed for internal communication (ESI and HInclude), were accessible from browsers. This allowed an attacker to specify and execute arbitrary controllers or services by manipulating the URL.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `FrameworkBundle:Internal:index` controller did not initially validate the type of service/controller being executed. This allowed arbitrary service calls, not just controllers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute any accessible controller, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a vulnerable controller was targeted.
- **Access to Protected Controllers:**  Attackers could bypass security restrictions and execute controllers that were not intended to be publicly accessible.
- **Service Exploitation:** Attackers could execute any service, not just controllers, leading to unexpected application behavior and potentially further vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Browser Access:** The primary attack vector involves directly accessing the `_internal` or `_internal_public` routes via a web browser.
- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers would manipulate the URL by specifying the desired controller or service to be executed as an argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
- **Knowledge of Internal Routes:** Attackers need to know or discover the existence of the `_internal` and `_internal_public` routes.
- **Knowledge of Accessible Services/Controllers:** To exploit the vulnerability effectively, attackers would benefit from knowing the names and functionalities of the controllers or services they intend to target.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Symfony2 (2.0.X, 2.1.X, and 2.2-dev) if the internal routes configuration is included.
*   The fix in Symfony 2.0.20 and 2.1.5 limits the executable services to only those ending with `Controller`, but this is a mitigation, not a full fix, according to the document.
*   The document provides several mitigation strategies, including removing the internal routes, restricting access via reverse proxy (Varnish, Nginx), and refactoring code to use explicit routes instead of internal ones.
*   The document describes how the vulnerability was completely removed in version 2.2 by removing internal routing altogether.
