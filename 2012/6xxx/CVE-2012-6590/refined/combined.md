### Description

Under certain conditions, when unexpected input is provided to the web-based management UI, overly verbose error information is delivered back to the client. This does not directly result in any specific vulnerability, however this information is helpful to an attacker. (Ref #33139)

This issue results in verbose error messages in specific cases, and does not directly result in an exploitable condition or product vulnerability. Overly verbose error messages can be helpful to an attacker looking to collect information on how a system is architected.

This issue affects PAN-OS 4.0.7 and earlier; PAN-OS 3.0.x is not affected.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 4.0 | <= 4.0.7 | >= 4.0.8 |
| PAN-OS 3.0 | None | 3.0.\* |
