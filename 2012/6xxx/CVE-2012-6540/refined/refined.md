Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6540:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's `getsockopt` implementation for `IP_VS_SO_GET_TIMEOUT`. Specifically, the `__ip_vs_get_timeouts()` function does not fully initialize the structure that is later copied to user space. This occurs when `CONFIG_IP_VS_PROTO_TCP` or `CONFIG_IP_VS_PROTO_UDP` are not set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leak:** The incomplete initialization of the `ip_vs_timeout_user` structure leads to a kernel stack memory leak. Uninitialized stack memory, potentially containing sensitive information, is copied to user space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A local user could exploit this vulnerability to examine parts of the kernel stack memory, potentially leaking sensitive data.
- The leaked information is described as a "minor leak" of stack memory, specifically up to 12 bytes.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user with access to the system.
- **`getsockopt` System Call:** The attack vector involves using the `getsockopt` system call with the `IP_VS_SO_GET_TIMEOUT` option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
- **Ability to execute system calls**: The attacker must be able to execute system calls to trigger `getsockopt`

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves adding an explicit `memset(0)` before passing the structure to `__ip_vs_get_timeouts()` ensuring it is fully initialized.
- The vulnerable code is located in `net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_ctl.c`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in the Linux kernel version v3.6 and backported to stable/longterm kernels.

In summary, CVE-2012-6540 describes an information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's IPVS module where a local attacker can retrieve uninitialized kernel stack data by using the `getsockopt` call with the `IP_VS_SO_GET_TIMEOUT` option.
