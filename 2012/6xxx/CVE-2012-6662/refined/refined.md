Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the jQuery UI Tooltip widget. Specifically, the default content of the tooltip was not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper sanitization of user-controlled input: The Tooltip widget did not properly encode or sanitize the title attribute, which was used as the default content of the tooltip.
- XSS vulnerability: The lack of sanitization led to a cross-site scripting vulnerability, where an attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the tooltip content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser session.
- Session hijacking or data theft: Attackers could potentially steal cookies or other sensitive information from the user's browser or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- Website defacement or manipulation: Attackers could also manipulate the website's content or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted title attributes: An attacker could craft a malicious title attribute for an element that uses the jQuery UI Tooltip widget.
- Server-side injection: If a website is generating the tooltip content dynamically using user-controlled data, an attacker could inject malicious content on the server side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control title attributes or other sources of tooltip content: An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into the title attribute of an element that uses the jQuery UI Tooltip widget or otherwise control the source of tooltip content, either directly in the HTML or by influencing server-side code.
- No special privileges required: The vulnerability can be triggered by anyone who can influence the tooltip content. 

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in jQuery UI 1.10.0 by escaping the title attribute to ensure it is treated as text and not HTML.
-  Several packages that use vulnerable versions of jQuery UI are listed as affected. The fix was applied to affected products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
- Some affected products were marked as "NOTABUG" when the components were found to not be using the jQuery UI component that contained the vulnerability.
