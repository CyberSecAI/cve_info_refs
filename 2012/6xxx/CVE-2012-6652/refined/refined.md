Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-6652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `wppageflip` WordPress plugin not properly sanitizing user input passed to the `pageflipbook_language` parameter in the `pageflipbook.php` script. Specifically, directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) are not handled correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The primary weakness is the ability to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. This is achieved by exploiting the lack of proper input sanitization in the `pageflipbook_language` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize user-provided input for directory traversal attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a file with malicious code, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This is limited to files already present on the target host.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read any file accessible by the web server user. This could include sensitive configuration files like WordPress' `wp-config.php`, potentially exposing database credentials and other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP request targeting the `wp-content/plugins/wppageflip/pageflipbook.php` script.
- **`pageflipbook_language` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected via the `pageflipbook_language` parameter, using directory traversal sequences to navigate to the desired file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the web server hosting the vulnerable WordPress installation.
- **Knowledge of the Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the WordPress site is using the vulnerable `wppageflip` plugin.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:**  The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable script and manipulate the `pageflipbook_language` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reportedly fixed in later versions of the plugin, with version 3.0 or later being deemed safe.
- The vulnerability was discussed on the WordPress support forums, as well as other security websites.
- The exploitability is limited to files already on the server, but this can still lead to significant impact.
