Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6271:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Adobe Shockwave Player's behavior of automatically installing "Xtras" (add-ons) without user prompts when a Shockwave movie attempts to use them. If an Xtra is signed by Adobe or Macromedia, it is installed silently. The location from which Shockwave downloads the Xtras is determined by the Shockwave movie itself, allowing an attacker to host old, vulnerable versions of these Xtras.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted Xtra Installation:** Shockwave Player automatically installs Xtras signed by Adobe or Macromedia without prompting the user.
- **Insecure Xtra Download Source:** The source of Xtras is controlled by the Shockwave movie, allowing attackers to direct the player to malicious or outdated Xtras.
- **Vulnerable Xtras:** Older versions of Xtras may contain known vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious Shockwave content. An attacker can gain control over the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Shockwave Content:** Attackers create specially crafted Shockwave content (e.g., embedded in a web page, HTML email, or attachment) that points to a malicious Xtra.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers trick users into viewing the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious or outdated Xtra.
- The attacker needs to create a malicious Shockwave movie that specifies the download location of the vulnerable Xtra.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to view the malicious content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the way Shockwave Player handles Xtra installations, not necessarily in the Shockwave player itself.
- The vulnerability is aggravated when using the "Slim" installer of Shockwave, since it contains fewer Xtras which increases the chances that a malicious Xtra needs to be downloaded.
- The "Full" installer, which includes more Xtras, might mitigate this vulnerability by already having the necessary Xtras installed, limiting the attacker's options.
- This vulnerability is related to VU#519137 and is also linked to the issue described in VU#323161.
- The provided documents lack specifics on which Xtras and vulnerabilities are specifically targeted or used in exploit scenarios.
