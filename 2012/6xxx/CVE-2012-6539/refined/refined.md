Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6539:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `dev_ifconf()` function in the Linux kernel's compat ioctl interface fails to initialize padding bytes in an intermediate `ifc` structure allocated in userland. This structure is used during the syscall.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Information Leak: Due to the lack of initialization, the padding bytes in the `ifc` structure leak four bytes of kernel stack memory to user space.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- A local user can exploit this flaw to examine parts of kernel stack memory. This information can potentially be used for further attacks, such as bypassing ASLR.

**Attack vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user using the compat ioctl interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.

**Additional details:**

- The fix involves adding an explicit `memset(0)` before filling the structure to avoid the information leak.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Linux kernel v3.6 and backported to stable/longterm kernels at the time.
