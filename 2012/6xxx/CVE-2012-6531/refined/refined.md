Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-3363

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability present in Zend Framework's `Zend_XmlRpc`, `Zend_Dom`, `Zend_Feed`, and `Zend_Soap` components.
- The root cause is the insecure use of the `SimpleXMLElement` class (from the SimpleXML PHP extension) to parse XML data. Specifically, external entities were not disabled during XML parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:**  The core vulnerability is the ability to inject external entities into XML documents processed by the vulnerable components. This is due to the failure to disable external entity loading when parsing XML data using `SimpleXMLElement`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to access local files on the server.  The attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the server's file system.
- **Potential for Other Attacks:**  The vulnerability may allow for the opening of arbitrary TCP connections.
- Depending on the application using these components, other attack vectors might be possible, though not detailed in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious XML document containing a DOCTYPE element with external entity definitions. This malformed XML can be sent via XML-RPC requests to `Zend_XmlRpc`, or be processed by `Zend_Dom`, `Zend_Feed`, and `Zend_Soap`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send malicious XML to the vulnerable application. This could involve interacting with a web service endpoint that uses `Zend_XmlRpc` (or other vulnerable components) or by providing crafted XML for parsing.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by invoking `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` prior to instantiating `SimpleXML` objects, which disables the parsing of external entities in XML.
- The fix is included in Zend Framework versions 1.11.12, 1.11.13, and 1.12.0 (and later) and was backported to the 2.0.0 development branch.
- Users of `Zend_XmlRpc_Server` or `Zend_XmlRpc_Client`, and those using `Zend_Dom`, `Zend_Feed`, and `Zend_Soap` were advised to upgrade immediately to a patched version.

**Additional Notes:**
- The initial report of the vulnerability did not have a CVE assigned, but was later assigned CVE-2012-3363.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Johannes Greil and Kestutis Gudinavicius of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab. Additional vectors were identified by PÃ¡draic Brady.
- Debian issued DSA-2505-1 to address this vulnerability.
