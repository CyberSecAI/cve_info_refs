Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core issue lies in MoinMoin's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing specific actions.  Specifically:
    *   `AnyWikiDraw` and `TWikiDraw` actions.
    *   The `AttachFile` action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Due to the lack of input sanitization, attackers can manipulate these actions to overwrite arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability in `AnyWikiDraw` and `TWikiDraw` can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server user.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The `AttachFile` action vulnerability allows for directory traversal, enabling attackers to overwrite files outside the intended directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker could gain full control of the server due to the ability to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Data Loss/Modification:** The arbitrary file overwrite vulnerability can lead to data corruption, deletion, or modification.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The ability to write to any file on the file system can also provide the attacker with access to sensitive information (depending on file permissions).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:**  The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerabilities are triggered through the MoinMoin web interface by manipulating specific actions in the HTTP requests.
*   **Write Access Required:** Attackers need to have write access to the wiki to exploit these vulnerabilities

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the MoinMoin instance.
*   **MoinMoin Account:** The attacker requires an account with write permissions on the wiki.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were actively being exploited, indicating a high risk.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in MoinMoin version 1.9.6
*   Ubuntu and Debian released security updates to patch the issue.
