{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `copy_to_user_auth()` function in the Linux kernel's XFRM implementation used `strcpy()` to copy the algorithm name to user space, without ensuring null termination if the source string is shorter than the destination buffer. This resulted in potential information disclosure of heap memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
       "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability could potentially leak kernel heap memory to user space.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Specifically crafted netlink requests to the XFRM API"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability."
