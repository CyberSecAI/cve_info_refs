{
  "CVE-2012-6151": {
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way snmpd, the Net-SNMP daemon, handled subagent timeouts. A remote attacker able to trigger a subagent timeout could use this flaw to cause snmpd to loop infinitely or crash.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of subagent timeouts in the Net-SNMP daemon (snmpd).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service due to infinite loop or crash",
      "Improper resource management"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause the snmpd daemon to crash or enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack triggering subagent timeouts"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger a subagent timeout. This may involve sending specially crafted requests that cause the subagent to not respond in time or sending traffic to overwhelm the subagent."
