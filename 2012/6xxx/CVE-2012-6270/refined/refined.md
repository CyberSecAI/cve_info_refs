Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6270:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Adobe Shockwave Player's behavior of automatically installing older versions of the Shockwave runtime when encountering content that does not explicitly specify player version 11. This downgrade mechanism introduces a legacy Flash runtime (version 8.0.34.0), which contains multiple known vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Downgrade Attack:** The core vulnerability is the ability of an attacker to force the installation of a vulnerable, older Shockwave runtime by serving content that doesn't specify player version 11.
- **Vulnerable Legacy Flash Runtime:** The older Shockwave runtime includes Flash 8.0.34.0, a version known to contain multiple exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a user's system with the user's privileges. This is achieved by enticing a user to view specially crafted Shockwave content, like a webpage, HTML email or attachment, that triggers the installation of the vulnerable legacy Shockwave runtime with its vulnerable flash version.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Pages:** An attacker can host malicious Shockwave content on a web page.
- **HTML Email:** Malicious Shockwave content can be embedded in an HTML email message.
- **Email Attachments:** An attacker can distribute the malicious Shockwave content as an email attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or distribute specially crafted Shockwave content that will force the Shockwave player to download the older vulnerable version of the Shockwave runtime.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a victim to open the malicious content through a web browser or via email.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided document mentions two vulnerability notes, VU#323161 and VU#546769. VU#546769 is directly related to CVE-2012-6270.
- VU#323161 discusses a vulnerable Flash runtime included in the Full installer of Shockwave player 12.1.1.151, which is different but related to the downgrade issue in VU#546769 / CVE-2012-6270.
- The provided text gives details about workarounds and mitigation techniques such as disabling the ActiveX control, using EMET, enabling DEP and restricting access to Director files.
