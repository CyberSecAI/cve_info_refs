# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2012-012: Several Vulnerabilities in extension Formhandler (formhandler)

It has been discovered that the extension Formhandler (formhandler) is vulnerable to SQL-Injection and Cross-Site Scripting.

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:** Version 1.4.0 and below

**Vulnerability Types:** SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting

**Severity:** Medium

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:C/A:P/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:C/A:P/E:P/RL:O/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Release Date:** October 25, 2012

**Update:** November 20, 2012 (replaced link to Security Cookbook by link to Security Guide)

**Problem Description:** Failing to properly sanitize user input, formhandler is susceptible to SQL Injection. An attacker could delete arbitrary database tables. Editors rights with permission to use the formhandler backend module are required for this to work.

Failing to encode user data for the HTML output, formhandler is susceptible to Cross Site Scripting. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Solution:** An updated version 1.4.1 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at [typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/formhandler/1.4.1/](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/formhandler/1.4.1/).

**Credits:** Thanks to Sven Krewitt who discovered and reported this issue.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://typo3.org/extension-manuals/doc_guide_security/current/). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.
