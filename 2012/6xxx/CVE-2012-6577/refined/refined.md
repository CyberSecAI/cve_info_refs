The provided content relates to **CVE-2012-6577**.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from the failure to properly sanitize user input, making the Formhandler extension susceptible to SQL injection. Additionally, the extension fails to encode user data for HTML output, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: Allows attackers to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code through user-supplied input.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, due to the failure to encode user data properly for HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- SQL Injection: An attacker with editor rights and permission to use the Formhandler backend module could exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to potentially delete arbitrary database tables.
- XSS: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages without requiring authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- SQL Injection: Attackers must have editor rights with permission to access the Formhandler backend module.
- XSS: No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For SQL injection: Requires the attacker to have editor rights within the TYPO3 CMS and permissions to use the Formhandler backend module.
- For XSS: No special capabilities or position are required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable extension is "Formhandler" (formhandler).
- Affected versions: 1.4.0 and below.
- The advisory mentions that the extension is a third-party extension, not part of the default TYPO3 installation.
- The provided CVSS score is: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:C/A:P/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
- A patched version (1.4.1) is available.
