Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-5592:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Wireshark handles host name resolution when working with multiple pcap-ng files.  It potentially leaks sensitive host name information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintended disclosure of potentially sensitive host name resolution information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privacy Violation:**  Sensitive host names can be leaked when sharing pcap-ng files, potentially revealing information about the network topology, internal systems, or user activities to unintended recipients.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Sharing:** An attacker can gain access to the sensitive information by receiving or intercepting pcap-ng files that were created by vulnerable versions of Wireshark.
- **Passive Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited passively, requiring no interaction with the host other than having access to the pcap-ng file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a pcap-ng file generated by a vulnerable version of Wireshark (1.8.0 to 1.8.3). No specific position or capabilities beyond file access are needed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Laura Chappell.
- The issue was resolved in Wireshark version 1.8.4.
- The issue is described as  "Wireshark #1 pcap-ng hostname disclosure" in the opensuse security update.
