Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Aeolus Conductor where user-provided input is not properly validated or sanitized, allowing unprivileged users to modify their own "Maximum Running Instances" quota.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Unprivileged users were able to access and modify settings that should be restricted to administrators or privileged roles.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application failed to validate or sanitize user-provided input for the "Maximum Running Instances" quota, allowing users to set arbitrary values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** By increasing their maximum running instances quota, an unprivileged user could potentially launch an excessive number of instances, leading to resource exhaustion on the system.
*   **Denial of Service:** The exploitation could cause instability and denial of service to other users by consuming excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the web interface of Aeolus Conductor.
*   **User Account Page:** An authenticated, unprivileged user could navigate to their account page within the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected Aeolus Conductor system.
*   **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker needs access to the web interface of the Aeolus Conductor.

**Summary**
The vulnerability allows a regular user to modify their resource limits (Maximum Running Instances), potentially causing denial of service by consuming too much resources. This was fixed in CloudForms 1.1.2.
