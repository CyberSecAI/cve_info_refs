Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6089:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the patch canonization code of SWI-Prolog. It involves pushing pointers onto an automatic array without proper bounds checking, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The automatic array resides on the stack, making it susceptible to overflow if the number of pointers exceeds its capacity.
- Lack of bounds checking: The code does not validate if the array is full before pushing new pointers onto it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is causing a crash or other unexpected behavior by corrupting stack memory, leading to a denial of service.
-  Arbitrary code execution: While the provided information states it is "extremely hard to make it execute arbitrary code," it does not explicitly rule out the possibility.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input to patch canonisation code: An attacker needs to provide input that leads to the vulnerable code being executed and causes more pointers than the array's capacity to be added.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to trigger the vulnerable code path. This may require some understanding of SWI-Prolog and the patch canonization process.
- The attacker likely needs to be able to control inputs to the affected function.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE was assigned in conjunction with CVE-2012-6090, which describes another vulnerability in SWI-Prolog.
- The vulnerability was fixed in SWI-Prolog versions 6.2.5 and 6.3.7.
- Red Hat has rated the severity of this issue as Low
- The vulnerability affects the `pl` package.
