The provided content is related to CVE-2012-6570.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP response messages. The device allocates memory based on the `Content-Length` field of the HTTP response but doesn't validate the actual length of the `Content` field before copying it to the heap using `strcpy()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow
- Lack of input validation on the `Content` field of HTTP response messages.
- Use of `strcpy()` which does not prevent buffer overflows.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary shellcode on the device, leading to complete control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malformed HTTP response message.
- The crafted response has a smaller `Content-Length` field compared to the actual length of the `Content` field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device.
- The HTTP management interface of the device must be in "Up" state.
- The management interface IP address must be reachable.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory specifies that the vulnerability was first reported by Felix Lindner of Recurity Labs GmbH.
- The affected products include various Huawei AR routers and switches.
- The advisory provides temporary fixes involving disabling HTTP service or restricting access through ACLs and upgrading the device software
- The CVSS v2 base score is 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), and the temporal score is 9.0 (E:H/RL:T/RC:C).
