Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the provided tickets. This analysis incorporates information from the FFmpeg trac system, the FFmpeg security page, and a security vendor page, and identifies CVE-2012-6618

**1. Verification of CVE Association**
The content from trac.ffmpeg.org and www.ffmpeg.org clearly indicates that ticket #1991 corresponds to a bug that was later assigned CVE-2012-6618.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The vulnerability is triggered by an integer overflow in the av_probe_input_buffer function within libavformat/utils.c.
   - Specifically, when ffmpeg attempts to probe the input buffer, it allocates memory based on the probesize given. An improper calculation during this probing process results in `pd.buf + pd.buf_size` causing a write beyond allocated memory boundary.
    - This memory allocation was based on the probesize argument, and when this was set to a large value, combined with `AVPROBE_PADDING_SIZE` would exceed the boundaries, and this padding operation caused the issue.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - Integer Overflow: The root cause is an integer overflow during memory allocation in the `av_probe_input_buffer` function.
   - Out-of-bounds write: A `memset` operation attempts to write to a memory address beyond the allocated buffer causing a buffer overflow.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Crash:** The primary impact is a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), causing the ffmpeg process to crash.
   - **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Though not explicitly stated in the provided text, integer overflows in memory allocation functions can sometimes be leveraged for arbitrary code execution under specific circumstances.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted input file or a large probesize argument value when opening the file.
   - **`-probesize` Argument:**  The command-line argument `-probesize` directly controls the memory allocation size during probing, making it a vector when set to a very large value.
    - The vulnerability is triggered when a large probesize argument is given to the ffmpeg command, combined with the padding size it caused a buffer overflow.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **User Level Access:** An attacker needs the ability to execute the `ffmpeg` command with the vulnerable options.
   - **Ability to Supply Input:** An attacker needs to supply the crafted input file, or a large enough probesize value to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information from Content**
   - The vulnerability was introduced in a regression between commits 57151f8 and 479fb7b.
   - It was fixed by Nicolas George as indicated in the trac ticket.
   - The issue was specific to the `avformat` component of FFmpeg.
    - The issue was discovered when a specific NRK audio file was given as input with a very large probesize argument.

**Summary**
CVE-2012-6618 is an integer overflow vulnerability in the `av_probe_input_buffer` function in FFmpeg. It can be triggered by providing a large probesize argument in combination with padding calculations, which causes a heap-buffer-overflow and leads to a crash (SIGSEGV) of the program. An attacker needs user-level access, the ability to supply the crafted input file, or set the -probesize option with a large value. The vulnerability was fixed in FFmpeg after its discovery.
