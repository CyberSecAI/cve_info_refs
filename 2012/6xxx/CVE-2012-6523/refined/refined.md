Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-6523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient input sanitization and validation within the w-CMS 2.01 application. Specifically, the application does not properly handle user-supplied data in multiple parameters, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) and directory traversal vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks through several parameters including `COMMENT`, `p` and `bid`. This occurs because the application reflects user-supplied input within the application's response without proper encoding or sanitization.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The application is susceptible to directory traversal attacks via the `p` parameter. By manipulating the `p` parameter, an attacker can access files outside of the intended web directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful XSS attacks can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Credential theft
    *   Website defacement
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
*   **Directory Traversal:** Successful directory traversal attacks can allow an attacker to:
    *   Read sensitive files on the server (e.g., configuration files, source code).
    *   Potentially modify files if the web server user has write access to the accessed files or directories.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include malicious javascript within the vulnerable parameters (`COMMENT`, `p`, `bid`). When a user clicks on such a link or visits a page with the malicious script, the script will execute in their browser.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The attack vector involves crafting URLs with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../..`) within the `p` parameter to access files outside the web root directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker needs to be able to convince a user to click on a malicious link or visit a web page containing the malicious code. This could be done via social engineering, email, or other means.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted URLs to the web server. No authentication is required to perform the attacks, which can be launched remotely.
