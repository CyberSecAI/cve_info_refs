Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-6140:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Google Authenticator PAM module manages its secret/state file. Specifically, the module prior to version 1.0, lacked a "user=" option which caused the secret file to be required to be readable by the user for the PAM module to function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the requirement for the secret file to be user-readable. This allows any local user to read the file, potentially exposing the shared secret.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to information disclosure of the shared secret stored in the file.
 
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Impersonation:** If an attacker gains access to the shared secret, they can use it to generate valid one-time passwords and impersonate the victim's account, bypassing two-factor authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable Google Authenticator PAM module is being used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have an account on the target system and the ability to read files.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix for this issue involves adding a "user=" option to the PAM module. This allows the module to use a secret file that is not readable by the user, preventing unauthorized access to the secret.
- The issue was initially reported in Debian bug #666129.
- Red Hat Bugzilla also tracked this issue as bug #953505.
