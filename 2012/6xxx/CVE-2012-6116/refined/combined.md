| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=906207#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-31 06:27:17 UTC  ```  Dominic Cleal reports   Description of problem: katello-configure generates a bootstrap RPM for installation on clients to be  connected to the Katello server.  This contains a CA certificate for Candlepin which has a mode set of 0666, permitting other users on a client system to  modify the CA used to trust the remote Katello server.  The RPM is named after the FQDN of the Katello server, e.g. candlepin-cert-consumer-$FQDN  # ll /etc/rhsm/ca/candlepin-local.pem  -rw-rw-rw-. 1 root root 5385 Nov 12 16:21 /etc/rhsm/ca/candlepin-local.pem  # rpm -qalv candlepin-cert-consumer-\* -rw-rw-rw-    1 root    root  5385 Nov 12 16:21 /etc/rhsm/ca/candlepin-local.pem  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Tested on 1.1 release, verified code present in git master.  How reproducible: Always.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. install Katello (<https://fedorahosted.org/katello/wiki/Install>) 2. run: katello-configure 3. run: rpm -qplv /var/www/html/pub/candlepin-cert-consumer-*noarch.rpm  Actual results: -rw-rw-rw-    1 root    root  5385 Nov 12 16:21 /etc/rhsm/ca/candlepin-local.pem  Expected results: -rw-r--r--    1 root    root  5385 Nov 12 16:21 /etc/rhsm/ca/candlepin-local.pem  Additional info: katello-configure generates the RPM from within the certs::config puppet class:    exec { "generate-candlepin-consumer-certificate":     cwd       => "${katello_www_pub_dir}",     command   => "gen-rpm.sh --name '${candlepin_consumer_name}' --version 1.0 --release 1 --packager None --vendor None --group 'Applications/System' --summary '${candlepin_consumer_summary}' --description '${candlepin_consumer_description}' --requires subscription-manager --post ${ssl_build_path}/rhsm-katello-reconfigure /etc/rhsm/ca/candlepin-local.pem:666=${ssl_build_path}/$candlepin_cert_name.crt 2>>${katello::params::configure_log_base}/certificates.log && /sbin/restorecon ./*rpm",     path      => "/usr/share/katello/certs:/usr/bin:/bin",     creates   => "${katello_www_pub_dir}/${candlepin_consumer_name}-1.0-1.noarch.rpm",     require   => [Exec["generate-candlepin-certificate"], File["${ssl_build_path}/rhsm-katello-reconfigure"], File["${katello::params::configure_log_base}"]]   }  In the middle of this command it passes in the permissions "666" to the gen-rpm.sh script, which get put into the RPM spec as the %attr for the CA cert file.  The gen-rpm.sh script is also used by katello-ssl-tool, but a quick test shows that this doesn't explicitly set the mode when it generates a CA RPM, so the RPM is generated with the file having default 644 permissions.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=906207#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-01 06:48:50 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 876580](show_bug.cgi?id=876580 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - [world-writable] /etc/rhsm/ca/candlepin-local.pem") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=906207#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-02-14 09:25:57 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Dominic Cleal and James Laska of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=906207#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 19:07:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    CloudForms for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2013:0547 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0547.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=906207#c6)  Bryan Kearney    2013-02-22 13:43:28 UTC  ``` commit 65f1e42b7bda0f3410931c50598540d944d8bf0d Author: Marek Hulan <ares> Date:   Tue Jan 22 12:48:10 2013 +0100      877387 - Candlepin CA certificate mode in RPM          File mode is set to 0644 when RPM is generated.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=906207#c7)  Martin Bacovsky    2013-02-22 14:38:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 701212](attachment.cgi?id=701212&action=diff "Fix for the permissions issue (in installer)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=701212&action=edit "Fix for the permissions issue (in installer)") Fix for the permissions issue (in installer)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=906207#c8)  sthirugn@redhat.com    2013-03-20 16:01:14 UTC  ``` Verified in SAM compose:  SAM 1.1 version: * candlepin-0.6.5-1.el6_2.noarch * candlepin-tomcat6-0.6.5-1.el6_2.noarch * elasticsearch-0.18.4-11.el6.noarch * katello-candlepin-cert-key-pair-1.0-1.noarch * katello-certs-tools-1.1.5-1.el6_2.noarch * katello-cli-common-0.3.5-2.el6_2.noarch * katello-cli-headpin-0.2.2-1.el6_2.noarch * katello-common-0.3.3-1.el6_2.noarch * katello-configure-0.3.7-1.el6_2.noarch * katello-glue-candlepin-0.3.3-1.el6_2.noarch * katello-headpin-0.2.13-1.el6_2.noarch * katello-headpin-all-0.2.13-1.el6_2.noarch * katello-selinux-0.2.4-1.el6_2.noarch * thumbslug-0.0.24-1.el6_2.noarch  SAM 1.2.1 Version: * candlepin-0.7.24-1.el6_3.noarch * candlepin-cert-consumer-gizmo.idm.lab.bos.redhat.com-1.0-1.noarch * candlepin-selinux-0.7.24-1.el6_3.noarch * candlepin-tomcat6-0.7.24-1.el6_3.noarch * elasticsearch-0.19.9-5.el6_3.noarch * katello-candlepin-cert-key-pair-1.0-1.noarch * katello-certs-tools-1.2.1-1h.el6_3.noarch * katello-cli-1.2.1-12h.el6_3.noarch * katello-cli-common-1.2.1-12h.el6_3.noarch * katello-common-1.2.1.1-1h.el6_4.noarch * katello-configure-1.2.3.1-4h.el6_4.noarch * katello-glue-candlepin-1.2.1.1-1h.el6_4.noarch * katello-headpin-1.2.1.1-1h.el6_4.noarch * katello-headpin-all-1.2.1.1-1h.el6_4.noarch * katello-selinux-1.2.1-2h.el6_3.noarch * thumbslug-0.0.28.1-1.el6_4.noarch * thumbslug-selinux-0.0.28.1-1.el6_4.noarch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=906207#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-26 19:17:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.2  Via RHSA-2013:0686 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0686.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=906207#c10)  Kurt Seifried    2013-07-26 07:41:17 UTC  ``` The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having moderate security impact in CloudForms 1.1.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0686)

## Topic

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.2.1, which fixes several security
issues, multiple bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager acts as a proxy for handling
subscription information and software updates on client machines.

The latest packages for Subscription Asset Manager include a number of security
fixes:

When a Subscription Asset Manager instance is created, its configuration
script automatically creates an RPM of the internal subscription service
CA certificate. However, this RPM incorrectly created the CA certificate
with file permissions of 0666. This allowed other users on a client system
to modify the CA certificate used to trust the remote subscription server.
All administrators are advised to update and deploy the subscription
service certificate on all systems which use Subscription Asset Manager
as their subscription service. This procedure is described in:
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Asset_Manager/1.2/html/Installation_Guide/sect-Installation_Guide-Administration-Upgrading_Subscription_Asset_Manager.html> (CVE-2012-6116)

Manifest signature checking was not implemented for early versions of
Subscription Asset Manager. This meant that a malicious user could edit
a manifest file, insert arbitrary data, and successfully upload the edited
manifest file into the Subscription Asset Manager server. (CVE-2012-6119)

Ruby's documentation generator had a flaw in the way it generated HTML
documentation. When a Ruby application exposed its documentation
on a network (such as a web page), an attacker could use a specially-
crafted URL to open an arbitrary web script or to execute HTML code
within the application's user session. (CVE-2013-0256)

A timing attack flaw was found in the way rubygem-rack and
ruby193-rubygem-rack processed HMAC digests in cookies. This flaw could aid
an attacker using forged digital signatures to bypass authentication
checks. (CVE-2013-0263)

A flaw in rubygem-json allowed remote attacks by creating different types
of malicious objects. For example, it could initiate a denial of service
(DoS) attack through resource consumption by using a JSON document to
create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected. It
could also be exploited to create internal objects which could allow a SQL
injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

A flaw in ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails allowed remote attackers to
circumvent attribute protections and to insert their own crafted requests
to change protected attribute values. (CVE-2013-0276)

HTML markup was not properly escaped when filling in the username field in
the Notifications form of the Subscription Asset Manager UI. This meant
that HTML code used in the value was then applied in the UI page when the
entry was viewed. This could have allowed malicious HTML code to be
entered. The field value is now validated and any HTML tags are escaped.
(CVE-2013-1823)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements:

* Previously, no SELinux policy for the subscription service was included

with the Subscription Asset Manager packages. The candlepin-selinux package
is now included with SELinux policies for the subscription server.
(BZ#906901)

* When attempting to use the subscription service's CA certificate to

validate a manifest during import, the comparison failed. The upstream
subscription service which generated the manifest is a different service
than the local subscription service; thus, they have different CA
certificates. This caused importing a manifest to fail with the error
'archive failed signature'. This has been fixed so that the proper
certificate is used for verification. (BZ#918778)

All users of Subscription Asset Manager are recommended to update to the
latest packages.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
