{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The katello-configure script generates a bootstrap RPM for clients containing a CA certificate for Candlepin. This certificate was incorrectly created with file permissions of 0666, making it world-writable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default file permissions on a CA certificate.",
        "World-writable file"
    ],
    "impact": "Other users on a client system could modify the CA certificate, allowing them to potentially man-in-the-middle the connection to the Katello server, leading to a compromise of the system's trust of the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to a client system where the vulnerable RPM is installed."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires local user access to the client system where the vulnerable bootstrap RPM was installed."

  ],
  "additional_notes": "The fix involved changing the file permissions to 0644 (read-only for owner, group and others). This was corrected in katello-configure, and distributed via RHSA-2013:0686. The vulnerability was present because the `gen-rpm.sh` script was passed the `666` permission directly by the `katello-configure` script, so that it was included in the RPM spec. This issue affected the RPM named `candlepin-cert-consumer-$FQDN`."
