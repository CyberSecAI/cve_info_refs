- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because the ZCC page could be embedded inside an HTML frame by another page, allowing for cross-frame scripting attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-frame scripting (also known as Clickjacking).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A phishing site could replicate the look and feel of the legitimate ZCC page, potentially tricking users into providing confidential information.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through embedding the vulnerable page in a frame on a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a web page that can embed the vulnerable application page in a frame. The user would then need to visit the attacker controlled website.
