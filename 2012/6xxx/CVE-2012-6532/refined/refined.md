Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-6532 (Based on the content, this CVE ID is associated with the identified vulnerability)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of XML Entity Expansion (XEE) in `Zend_Dom`, `Zend_Feed`, `Zend_Soap`, and `Zend_XmlRpc` components of Zend Framework. This is due to how these components handle XML input using `SimpleXML` or `DOMDocument`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML Entity Expansion (XEE):** The core weakness is the failure to properly sanitize or disable XML entity loading when processing user-supplied XML data. This allows an attacker to define malicious entities within the XML document, leading to the expansion of these entities by the XML parser.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The components directly process XML data without disabling external entity loading, thus creating the XEE vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service attack. By crafting XML documents with recursive or circular entity definitions, an attacker can force the XML parser to consume excessive CPU and memory resources during entity expansion. This can lead to server performance degradation or even server crashes, making the affected application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML Input:** The attack vector involves providing maliciously crafted XML data to vulnerable components, such as through web service calls (SOAP, XML-RPC), XML parsing in a web application, or RSS/Atom feeds.
- The attacker could be positioned anywhere able to provide user-controlled input via any of the components that are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply XML:** The attacker must be able to provide malicious XML input to the vulnerable components. This could be via API calls, form submissions, or any other vector that allows the injection of XML into the Zend Framework application.
- **No specific authentication is mentioned**, but access would need to be gained to a point that allows the injection of malicious XML.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was mitigated by:
- **Disabling Entity Loading:** Calling `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` to prevent external entities from being resolved.
- **Validating DOCTYPE:** Checking for `XML_DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE` before parsing to prevent malicious entity definitions from being used.
- **Using `DOMDocument`:** Loading XML via `DOMDocument` for validation and then using `simplexml_import_dom()` to ensure entities are resolved.

**Additional Information:**

- Patches were applied starting from versions 1.11.13 and 1.12.0 of Zend Framework and were ported to the 2.0.0 development branch (first released with 2.0.0rc4).
- It is recommended that users immediately upgrade to the patched versions or higher to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The specific vulnerable components are `Zend_Dom`, `Zend_Feed`, `Zend_Soap`, and `Zend_XmlRpc`.
