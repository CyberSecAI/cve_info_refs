### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1073591#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-06 18:36:17 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that cloud-init could send requests for EC2 instance data to untrusted systems.  This could allow someone who has control over a suitable domain name to obtain root rights on an affected system.  This issue was found and silently fixed in 2012; version 0.7.0 contains the fix [3].  [1] <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/514> [2] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1040200](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/%2Bbug/1040200) [3] <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/trunk/revision/635>   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of cloud-init as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.0.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1073591#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-06 18:37:07 UTC  ``` Created cloud-init tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1073592](show_bug.cgi?id=1073592 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-6639 cloud-init: insecure transmission of EC2 instance data can lead to root privilege escalation [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1073591#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-06 18:39:05 UTC  ``` This does affect EPEL5, however, as it provides cloud-init 0.6.3.  I do see now that EPEL 6 does in fact include 0.7.4.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1073591#c3)  Sam Kottler    2014-03-07 08:43:50 UTC  ``` A patch that fixes this bug was added the cloud-init in EPEL 5 back in 2012, so it's not vulnerable either.  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/cloud-init.git/commit/?h=el5&id=8462fc9d5504c426d14baa797a759006435e078f>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1073591#c4)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-07 17:57:15 UTC  ``` Perfect, thanks Sam!   ``` |  |

This was reported and fixed silently in 2012, so it would need a 2012 CVE name.   (This issue is not specific to cloud-init, there seem to be some wget scripts out there which exhibit the same behavior, but it's probably some custom stuff that's not distributed anywhere, so no CVE is needed for that.)   -- Florian Weimer / Red Hat Product Security Team    References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1073591> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=867302#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-03-07 07:22:15 UTC  ``` The SWAMPID for this issue is 56555.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-03-07 06:10:05 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  It was reported [1],[2] that cloud-init could send requests for EC2 instance data to untrusted  systems.  This could allow someone who has control over a suitable domain name to obtain root  rights on an affected system.  This issue was found and silently fixed in 2012; version 0.7.0 contains the fix [3].  [1] <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/514> [2] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1040200](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/%2Bbug/1040200) [3] <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/trunk/revision/635> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-03-07 06:11:17 UTC  ``` Filed for tracking purpose. ``` |  |
