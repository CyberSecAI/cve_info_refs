```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vBShout mod for vBulletin is vulnerable to persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Persistent XSS vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the shoutbox, which is then executed when other users view the shoutbox archive, potentially leading to user compromise.
- Attack vectors: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the shoutbox.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to post to the shoutbox.
