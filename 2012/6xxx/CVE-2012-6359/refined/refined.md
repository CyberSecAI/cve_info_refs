{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) does not validate if attributes received via the OpenID 'simple registration extension' (SREG) or 'attribute exchange extension' (AX) are signed by the OpenID provider.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing signature validation for OpenID attributes",
      "Accepting unsigned attributes from OpenID providers"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject unsigned attributes, potentially compromising the integrity of data used in the OpenID exchange. The impact of this compromise depends on the nature and use of the OpenID attributes by the applications consuming them.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack",
      "Browser-based manipulation"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs specialized knowledge and techniques to insert unsigned attributes during the OpenID exchange. No authentication or local network access is required for the attack."
