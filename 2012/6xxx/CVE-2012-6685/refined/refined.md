Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6685:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Nokogiri's processing of XML external entities. Specifically, it allows a crafted XML document to specify external URLs (including file and HTTP), which are then accessed by the XML parser during parsing. This allows an attacker to potentially trigger connections to internal network resources or leak sensitive local files if the parser is processing attacker-supplied XML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the parser's capability to resolve and fetch external entities specified within a document, and the default behaviour of allowing this. This can lead to both local file inclusion and server-side request forgery.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The vulnerability was present because Nokogiri, by default, did not disable external entity resolution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially read local files on the server where the parsing occurs, by specifying `file://` URLs in the XML.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can cause the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs (including internal network resources), potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks on internal systems.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing malicious external URLs, an attacker could also cause resource exhaustion on the server by forcing it to make multiple requests or attempt to access invalid paths.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the processing of malicious XML documents provided by the attacker. This could be through user-supplied content, manipulated data within a web application or by any other source that can inject XML.
- An attacker needs to craft an XML document with external entities that point to the desired targets (local files or external URLs).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit or influence the XML document that is parsed by a vulnerable Nokogiri installation.
- No specific network position is needed beyond the ability to make the server process the crafted XML.

**Additional Details:**
- **Nokogiri versions affected:** Versions prior to 1.6.4 were vulnerable.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Nokogiri 1.5.4 introduced a `nonet` option to disable network connections, but local file access was still possible.
  - Nokogiri 1.6.4 used libxml2 version 2.9.0 that fixed the vulnerability by disabling fetching of external parsed entities by default.
  - Users of system-provided libxml2 libraries prior to version 2.9.2 remain vulnerable.
- **Reproducibility:** The provided example in the github issue demonstrates how an attacker can trigger the vulnerability using a crafted XML document with external entities.

The Red Hat Bugzilla entry provides a good summary of the vulnerability, and it was fixed by ensuring a vulnerable version of `libxml2` was not used.
The github issue provides a good demonstration of the attack and the associated risk.
The nokogiri changelog provides some details about the timeline of mitigations for the vulnerability, and the library changes that were necessary.
