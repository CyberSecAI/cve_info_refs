```
{
  "Root cause": "The `sftp_mkdir` function in `sftp.c` of libssh has a double free vulnerability. The code frees the buffer and path, and then, on error, it attempts to free the same memory again, resulting in a double free.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Double free vulnerability in sftp_mkdir function"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by exploiting the double free.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted sftp packet to the client can trigger the double free in `sftp_mkdir`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious sftp packet to a client using libssh."
