| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=87#c0)  bs    1998-11-16 12:51:39 UTC  ``` Henry Stiles Email: henrys.com in comp.os.linux.hardware says:  I am trying to install "stock" Redhat 5.2 on a Gateway 2000 Pentium II.  It has an Adaptec 294x ultra scsi host adapter and some sort of IBM SCSI disk.  The disk drive and adapter seem to be properly detected and I can get through almost 1/2 of the installation but then I get intermittant failures with scsi error messages like: "aborting command due to timeout:" "scsi host 0 abort timed out resetting" finally, the machine locks up. The same machine ran Redhat 4.1 without any problems.  Me too, a Pentium II 300 with Adaptec 2940UW.  I tried to search in DejaNews, and I found some german newsgroups with the same problem. They all say that the new driver is buggy.  It would be nice to have a new boot image soon.  Regards,  Sandor Barany   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=87#c1)  Matt Wilson    1998-11-16 18:36:59 UTC  ``` Problem is known, errata disks should be ready soon - msw   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=87#c2)  motyl    1998-11-22 18:18:59 UTC  ``` I would like to add a comment about new Adaptec driver 5.1.3 introduced in 2.0.36pre14. It does not read SCSI EEPROM and defaults to extended translation: ENABLED, what breaks lilo and fdisk if disk was formatted with disabled extended translation see <http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists/linux-scsi/ls_9811_03/msg00051.html>  I have also noticed that the kernel-2.0.36-1.src.rpm should be affected by this bug.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=87#c3)  David Lawrence    1998-12-14 19:43:59 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 87](show_bug.cgi?id=87 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - aic7xxx driver V5.1 is buggy: scsi timeouts") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** It is impossible to boot the 2.0.36 kernel from an Adaptec AIC 7880 on-board UW SCSI chip. This has prevented the installation of RH 5.2 on what was to be my company's first official Linux server. The bug is clearly in aicxxxx.o.  I have installed RH 5.0 with all errata including kernel 2.0.35 without any problem on this machine. I installed the 2.0.36 kernel source and built a new kernel: it won't boot. Same problem as when installing RH 5.2 : command aborted due to time-out, SCSI bus resets, etc...  The newsgroups are overflowing with complaints about this, but I have not seen an official RH response.  Can I make a boot diskette with a 2.0.35 kernel to install/upgrade RH 5.2 ?  I have now manually installed/upgraded all RH 5.2 RPMS on top of RH 5.0 and now the machine runs RH 5.2 with a 2.0.35 kernel, but it was rather tedious.  Danny Heijl.  Danny.Heijl ---  ------- Additional Comments From Danny.Heijl  12/14/98 12:20 ------- I can make the 2.0.36 kernel boot by applying the aicxxx 5.1.2 to 5.1.3 and 5.1.3 to 5.1.4 patches (from your pub/aic directory) and building and installing a new kernel.  The RH 5.2 CD/boot floppy install problem remains of course.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=87#c4)  Matt Wilson    1998-12-14 20:29:59 UTC  ``` Just to let everyone know - we're working to make new boot images and install instructions to fix a variety of problems.  The images will be ready as soon as possible.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=87#c5)  Matt Wilson    1999-01-12 03:43:59 UTC  ``` This was fixed in the errata bootdisk release earlier this month.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-30 20:55:49 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team reported several instances of code in libssh where a heap region is deallocated twice, first in the main path and then on the error path.  This could crash the process using libssh, or possible allow for the execution of arbitrary code.  The identified affected variables are:  agent.c:agent_sign_data(): request channels.c:channel_request(): req auth.c:ssh_userauth_pubkey(): user, service, method, algo, pkstr sftp.c:sftp_parse_attr_3(): longname, name sftp.c:sftp_mkdir(): buffer, path keyfiles.c:try_publickey_from_file(): pubkey  sftp.c:sftp_mkdir() has been corrected via the following git commit:  <http://git.libssh.org/projects/libssh.git/commit/?h=v0-5&id=4d8420f3282ed07fc99fc5e930c17df27ef1e9b2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-10-30 20:57:01 UTC  ``` Andreas Schneider also noted:  sftp_parse_attr_3() can be used for a DoS. It is used by sftp_readdir() and the sftp_*stat() functions. So a special crafted sftp packet to the client, which is pretty easy to do, can be sent to the client.  The server implementations are probably not vulnerable because they call the functions with expectname = 0.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c2)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 08:48:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644659](attachment.cgi?id=644659&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644659&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c3)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 08:48:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644660](attachment.cgi?id=644660&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644660&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c4)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 08:49:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644661](attachment.cgi?id=644661&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644661&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c5)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:41:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644984](attachment.cgi?id=644984&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644984&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-we-don-t-free-blob-or-request-t.patch   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c6)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:41:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644985](attachment.cgi?id=644985&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644985&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Ensure-that-we-don-t-free-req-twice.patch   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c7)  Andreas Schneider    2012-11-14 16:42:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644986](attachment.cgi?id=644986&action=diff "CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644986&action=edit "CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch") CVE-2012-4559-Make-sure-we-don-t-free-name-and-longn.patch   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c8)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-20 15:29:27 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream:  <http://www.libssh.org/2012/11/20/libssh-0-5-3-security-release/>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c9)  Vincent Danen    2012-11-20 15:35:08 UTC  ``` Created libssh tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 878521](show_bug.cgi?id=878521 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-4559 CVE-2012-4560 CVE-2012-4561 CVE-2012-4562 libssh various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=871612#c10)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-27 05:27:09 UTC  ``` libssh-0.5.3-1.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

# libssh 0.5.3 (SECURITY RELEASE)

by [Andreas](https://www.libssh.org/author/asn/ "View all posts by Andreas")|Published [November 20, 2012](https://www.libssh.org/2012/11/20/ "14:10")

This is an important SECURITY and maintenance release in order to address CVE-2012-4559, CVE-2012-4560, CVE-2012-4561 and CVE-2012-4562.

* [CVE-2012-4559](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4559) – Fix multiple double free() flaws
* [CVE-2012-4560](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4560) – Fix multiple buffer overflow flaws
* [CVE-2012-4561](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4561) – Fix multiple invalid free() flaws
* [CVE-2012-4562](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-4562) – Fix multiple improper overflow checks

The double free in sftp\_parse\_attr\_3() could be used for a Denial of Service attack against a libssh client implementation. The sftp server implementations are probably not vulnerable. However we suggest everyone to update to version 0.5.3.

Thanks to Xi Wang and Florian Weimer for the reports, help and fixes.

If you are new to libssh read [The Tutorial](http://api.libssh.org/stable/libssh_tutorial.html) how to get started. Please [join our mailing list](http://www.libssh.org/communication/) or visit our irc channel if you have questions.

You can download libssh 0.5.3 [here](https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files). For Windows binaries we suggest to use the MSVC and MinGW binaries from the KDE Windows project [here](http://winkde.org/pub/kde/ports/win32/). Packages for Fedora and for openSUSE are available [here](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network%3A/synchronization%3A/files/).

The security patches are available as a tarball [here](https://red.libssh.org/projects/libssh/files).

## ChangeLog

* CVE-2012-4559 Fixed multiple double free() flaws.
* CVE-2012-4560 Fixed multiple buffer overflow flaws.

Package        : libssh
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4559 CVE-2012-4561 CVE-2012-4562
Debian Bug

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libssh by Florian Weimer and Xi
Wang:

CVE-2012-4559: multiple double free() flaws
CVE-2012-4561: multiple invalid free() flaws
CVE-2012-4562: multiple improper overflow checks

Those could lead to a denial of service by making an ssh client linked to
libssh crash, and maybe even arbitrary code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.5-3+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.3-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.
