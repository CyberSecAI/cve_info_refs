{
  "CVE-2012-6152": {
    "description": "A Denial-of-Service flaw was found in the way Yahoo protocol plugin handled character encoding. Many places in the Yahoo! protocol plugin assumed incoming strings were UTF-8 and failed to transcode from non-UTF-8 encodings. This can lead to a crash when receiving strings that aren't UTF-8.",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the Pidgin Yahoo! protocol plugin's failure to validate that incoming strings are in UTF-8 encoding before processing them. This could lead to a crash when receiving non-UTF-8 encoded data.",
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause Pidgin to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote. A remote attacker can send a message containing non-UTF-8 characters to a vulnerable Pidgin client through the Yahoo! protocol.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send messages via the Yahoo! protocol to a user running a vulnerable version of Pidgin. No specific position or capabilities are required beyond having a Yahoo! account.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in the Yahoo protocol plugin when handling incoming string data which leads to a crash if the data is not UTF-8 encoded."
