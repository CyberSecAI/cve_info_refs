### Overview

The TP-LINK TL-WR841N wireless router contains a local file inclusion vulnerability which could allow an attacker to download critical configuration files off the device.

### Description

| [CWE-829](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html): Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere  The TP-LINK TL-WR841N wireless router web-based management interface contains a local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent local file inclusion attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the TP-LINK TL-WR841N web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
