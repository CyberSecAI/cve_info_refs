- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TP-LINK TL-WR841N wireless router's web-based management interface does not properly sanitize URL parameters before parsing them, leading to a local file inclusion vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability (CWE-829).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the web interface can download critical configuration files from the device.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface by crafting a malicious HTTP request containing a path to a file on the router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to the TP-LINK TL-WR841N web interface, possibly requiring network access to the device.
