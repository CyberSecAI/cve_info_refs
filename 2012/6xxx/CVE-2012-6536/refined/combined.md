xfrm\_user: ensure user supplied esn replay window is valid

```
The current code fails to ensure that the netlink message actually
contains as many bytes as the header indicates. If a user creates a new
state or updates an existing one but does not supply the bytes for the
whole ESN replay window, the kernel copies random heap bytes into the
replay bitmap, the ones happen to follow the XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL
netlink attribute. This leads to following issues:

1. The replay window has random bits set confusing the replay handling
   code later on.

2. A malicious user could use this flaw to leak up to ~3.5kB of heap
   memory when she has access to the XFRM netlink interface (requires
   CAP_NET_ADMIN).

Known users of the ESN replay window are strongSwan and Steffen's
iproute2 patch (<<http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/85962/>>). The latter
uses the interface with a bitmap supplied while the former does not.
strongSwan is therefore prone to run into issue 1.

To fix both issues without breaking existing userland allow using the
XFRMA_REPLAY_ESN_VAL netlink attribute with either an empty bitmap or a
fully specified one. For the former case we initialize the in-kernel
bitmap with zero, for the latter we copy the user supplied bitmap. For
state updates the full bitmap must be supplied.

To prevent overflows in the bitmap length calculation the maximum size
of bmp_len is limited to 128 by this patch -- resulting in a maximum
replay window of 4096 packets. This should be sufficient for all real
life scenarios (RFC 4303 recommends a default replay window size of 64).

Subject: CVE Requests (maybe): Linux kernel: various info leaks, some NULL ptr derefs

Hi Kurt,

I don't care much about info leaks beyond merely fixing them. But
Alexander asked me to request a CVE ID for the recent crypto fix of
mine and as I did quite a few of such fixes in the recent past, I'll
just list them all here. The information might be a bit scarce for a
CVE ID request but as I don't expect any CVE IDs anyway, I didn't
wanted to do too much unnecessary work. ;)

9a5467b crypto: user - fix info leaks in report API

This is quite a big info leak of heap, stack and .text memory. No
crypto material, though. Also, as the crypto user API is protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN), it's not as critical as is might sound on the
first sight. It affects all versions from the introduction of the
crypto user API -- that is v3.2 - v3.8.

Older info leak fixes follow. All of them ended up in v3.6 and were
backported to the stable/longterm kernels at the time:

ecd7918 xfrm_user: ensure user supplied esn replay window is valid
What: Leaks up to ~3.5kb heap memory. Was protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

1f86840 xfrm_user: fix info leak in copy_to_user_tmpl()
What: Minor leak of stack memory. Was protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

7b78983 xfrm_user: fix info leak in copy_to_user_policy()
What: Minor leak of heap memory. Was protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

f778a63 xfrm_user: fix info leak in copy_to_user_state()
What: Minor leak of heap memory. Was protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

4c87308 xfrm_user: fix info leak in copy_to_user_auth()
What: Leak of heap memory. Was protected by capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

43da5f2 net: fix info leak in compat dev_ifconf()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

2d8a041 ipvs: fix info leak in getsockopt(IP_VS_SO_GET_TIMEOUT)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

7b07f8e dccp: fix info leak via getsockopt(DCCP_SOCKOPT_CCID_TX_INFO)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

3592aae llc: fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Major leak of stack memory (up to 128 bytes).

04d4fbc l2tp: fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

792039c Bluetooth: L2CAP - Fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

9344a97 Bluetooth: RFCOMM - Fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

f9432c5 Bluetooth: RFCOMM - Fix info leak in ioctl(RFCOMMGETDEVLIST)
What: Minor leak of heap memory.

9ad2de4 Bluetooth: RFCOMM - Fix info leak in getsockopt(BT_SECURITY)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

3f68ba0 Bluetooth: HCI - Fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

e15ca9a Bluetooth: HCI - Fix info leak in getsockopt(HCI_FILTER)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

3c0c5cf atm: fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

e862f1a atm: fix info leak in getsockopt(SO_ATMPVC)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

a117dac net/tun: fix ioctl() based info leaks
What: Leak of 36 bytes of stack memory.

0143fc5 udf: avoid info leak on export
What: Minor leak of heap memory.

fe685aa isofs: avoid info leak on export
What: Minor leak of heap memory.

Now do follow a few NULL ptr derefs ending up in privilege escalation
if a user is able to map page 0 or probably a DoS otherwise. Also
those have all been fixed in v3.6 and backported to the corresponding
stable/longterm kernels at the time:

864745d xfrm_user: return error pointer instead of NULL
What: Wrong return of NULL leads to wrong path in calling function
leading to NULL pointer deref of skb.

276bdb8 dccp: check ccid before dereferencing
What: Missing NULL pointer check leads to NULL function pointer.

That's all. Enough, I guess ;)

While we are at it: Do we care about getting CVE IDs for info leaks?
If so, all of them or only for the ones with leaks above a certain
threshold (>= 16 bytes, e.g.)?

Regards,
Mathias
