Subject: bcron: Possible bcron security breach
Date: Tue, 04 Sep 2012 16:49:14 +0600
```
Package: bcron
Version: 0.09-12
Severity: normal
Tags: upstream

Dear Maintainer,

I think I have found a security breach in bcron. Bcron-exec program does not close
its file descriptors when does fork()/exec() to run scheduled jobs. When used in
untrusted environment such as shared hosting, it is possible for one user to send
spam from neighbour user's accounts or read other's cron job stdout.

In deeper details. If any user's program runs through cron and generates some output to
stdout/stderr, cron must send its output to owner's e-mail. Bcron uses start_slot()
function to create a temp file, write e-mail message headers in there to prepare
this mail to be sent and then does fork/exec to run scheduled task and redirects
its stdout/stderr to this particular file. After this task done its work,
bcron in end_slot() compares the length of temp file with stored length of empty
temp file with only headers filled in and if they differ, end_slot() runs sendmail
to deliver this message.

start_slot() calls forkexec_slot() to fork and forkexec_slot() calls exec_cmd()
to exec corresponding task. But before calling execv() it must close all open fds
execpt stdin/stdout/stderr. Unfortunatelly, there is no such code in exec_cmd().

If one creates 2 tasks and runs them simultaneously using bcron, the following
situation occurs:

1. First task (cron1.sh):

root@debian:~# lsof -p 14230
COMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF  NODE NAME
cron1.sh 14230 root  cwd    DIR  254,0     4096   902 /root
cron1.sh 14230 root  rtd    DIR  254,0     4096     2 /
cron1.sh 14230 root  txt    REG  254,0   106920   624 /bin/dash
cron1.sh 14230 root  mem    REG  254,0  1583120   732 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.13.so
cron1.sh 14230 root  mem    REG  254,0   136936   977 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.13.so
cron1.sh 14230 root    0u   CHR    1,3      0t0  1199 /dev/null
cron1.sh 14230 root    1u   REG   0,17   479453 22716 /tmp/bcron.14096.1346752020.105007 (deleted)
cron1.sh 14230 root    2u   REG   0,17   479453 22716 /tmp/bcron.14096.1346752020.105007 (deleted)
cron1.sh 14230 root    3r  FIFO    0,8      0t0 55752 pipe
cron1.sh 14230 root   10r   REG  254,0       45   115 /root/cron1.sh

2. second task (cron2.sh):

root@debian:~# lsof -p 14231
COMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF  NODE NAME
cron2.sh 14231 root  cwd    DIR  254,0     4096   902 /root
cron2.sh 14231 root  rtd    DIR  254,0     4096     2 /
cron2.sh 14231 root  txt    REG  254,0   106920   624 /bin/dash
cron2.sh 14231 root  mem    REG  254,0  1583120   732 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.13.so
cron2.sh 14231 root  mem    REG  254,0   136936   977 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.13.so
cron2.sh 14231 root    0u   CHR    1,3      0t0  1199 /dev/null
cron2.sh 14231 root    1u   REG   0,17   316908 22717 /tmp/bcron.14096.1346752020.105958 (deleted)
cron2.sh 14231 root    2u   REG   0,17   316908 22717 /tmp/bcron.14096.1346752020.105958 (deleted)
cron2.sh 14231 root    3r  FIFO    0,8      0t0 44757 pipe
cron2.sh 14231 root    6u   REG   0,17   318938 22716 /tmp/bcron.14096.1346752020.105007 (deleted)
cron2.sh 14231 root   10r   REG  254,0       45   112 /root/cron2.sh

Notice fd #6 is temp file created for gathering output of cron1.sh but cron2.sh
has access to it and may overwrite it with its own content. And this message
would be sent from cron1 while cron1 never generated it.

Speaking about shared hosting environment, it is possible for malicious user
to send spam without any traces showing this spam was sent from his/her account.

I'm going to attach path fixing this issue after it is tested and considered stable.

Hello there,

the patch is as simple as follows:

$ diff bcron-exec.c.orig bcron-exec.c
108a109
>   int slot;
110d110
<   close(fdin);
113c113,115
<   close(fdout);
---
>   for (slot = 0; slot < SLOT_MAX; ++slot)
>     if (slots[slot].tmpfd != -1)
>       close(slots[slot].tmpfd);

I'm going to do more testing on production systems with heavy bcron usage (few thousands jobs per day) and report about success/failure after a couple of days.

Best regards,
Anton Khalikov

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.7) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].
