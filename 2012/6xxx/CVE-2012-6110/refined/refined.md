Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6110:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `bcron-exec` program in `bcron` does not close file descriptors associated with temporary files before executing a cron job. This allows subsequently executed cron jobs to potentially access these open file descriptors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **File Descriptor Leak:** The primary issue is the failure to close temporary file descriptors in `bcron-exec` before it executes the scheduled task. These file descriptors point to temporary files used to store the output of other cron jobs.
- **Information Disclosure & Modification:** Due to the file descriptor leak, a cron job can gain access to the temporary output files of other concurrently running cron jobs. This allows it to read output from other user's cron jobs, or overwrite the output of another job.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Spam Sending:** A malicious user could overwrite the output file associated with another user's cron job. This modified output could then be sent as an email, effectively making it appear as if the other user sent the spam.
- **Information Disclosure:** Users could read the output of other user's cron jobs, potentially gaining sensitive information.
- **Data Manipulation:** It is possible to modify or overwrite the temporary output files of other users, leading to incorrect data being sent in email reports.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability requires a user with the ability to create and schedule cron jobs, which is a local attack vector.
- **Concurrency:** The vulnerability relies on the timing of concurrent cron jobs. It would require multiple jobs to run at the same time.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Cron Job Access:**  The attacker must have the ability to schedule cron jobs on the system. In a shared hosting environment, this typically means having a user account.
- **Concurrent Job Scheduling:** The attacker needs to be able to schedule cron jobs in a way that they run concurrently with other users' jobs for exploitation.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content contains a patch which addresses the vulnerability by closing all open temporary file descriptors in `bcron-exec` before calling the `execv()` function. The patch also marks temporary files as close-on-exec to prevent them from being inherited by child processes.
- The vulnerability is rated as "critical" in the bug report.
- The fix was released in `bcron` version 0.09-13 for unstable and 0.09-11+squeeze1 for stable.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `bcron` prior to 0.10.
