```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- Insufficient input sanitization leads to stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
- Lack of CSRF protection allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of users.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Persistent XSS in music upload.
- Persistent XSS in creating events.
- Reflected XSS in the search form of the events area.
- Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities in the Forum, Event, and Classifieds plugins.

Impact of exploitation:
- XSS: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious activities.
- CSRF: An attacker can force a user to perform unwanted actions, like closing/opening topics or events, or watching/unwatching topics.

Attack vectors:
- XSS:
    - Injecting malicious JavaScript into the title or description fields of music uploads and events.
    - Injecting JavaScript into the search form of the events area.
- CSRF:
    - Sending crafted GET requests to vulnerable endpoints to perform unauthorized actions (close/open forum topics, events, classified listings, watch/stop watching topics)

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- XSS: Ability to post to the vulnerable forms and/or inject code into search forms
- CSRF: Ability to entice or force a logged-in user to visit a malicious link or page controlled by the attacker.
