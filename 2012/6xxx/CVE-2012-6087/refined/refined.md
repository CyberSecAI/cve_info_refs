Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2012-6087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect configuration of the `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` option in the Amazon S3 PHP class used by Moodle. The class was setting the value to `1`, which only checks for the existence of a Common Name field in the certificate but does not verify if the name matches the host.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL host verification. By setting `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` to `1`, the code bypassed proper host verification during SSL/TLS connections to the Amazon S3 repository.
- Use of a vulnerable library. The Amazon S3 PHP class was using an insecure cURL option.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. An attacker could potentially intercept and manipulate communications between the Moodle server and the Amazon S3 repository.
- Data exposure/compromise. Attackers could potentially gain access to data stored in or transmitted to the Amazon S3 repository.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker positioned on the network path between the Moodle server and the Amazon S3 repository could intercept and potentially manipulate traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the network communication between the Moodle server and the Amazon S3 repository.
- Ability to potentially intercept, redirect, or manipulate network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was present in Moodle versions 2.5 to 2.5.1, 2.4 to 2.4.5, 2.3 to 2.3.8, and previous unsupported versions.
- The issue was fixed in Moodle versions 2.5.2, 2.4.6, and 2.3.9 by updating the Amazon S3 PHP library to correctly set `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` to `2`.
- The vulnerability was identified by a user named ghedo from debian.org and reported by Thijs Kinkhorst.
- A fix was implemented in the `amazon-s3-php-class` library via a pull request, which was merged.
