| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=908613#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-07 07:06:11 UTC  ```  Description of problem:  User can muck with a manifest file, upload it and it will still parse (in most  reasonable cases, I imagine).   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1.  Get a manifest file. drill down into $manifest.zip > consumer_export.zip  > export > entitlements 2.  Modify the id value in the first line of the contained file.  If you want, go ahead and rename the file to match the id string you just modified. 3.  Attempt to import manifest file into CFSE    Actual results: Manifest file is imported.  Expected results: Manifest file should be rejected due to lack of signature integrity.  Additional info:   * Apparently a known backlog issue in candlepin - tracked here to assure  visibility in QE.  * Does this exist in the wild? If so, what's to stop a customer from staying  on any existing CFSE install and hacking away at a manifest to their heart's  content?  I know such changes used to get rejected.  Not sure how recent a  development this is.  External reference: <https://github.com/candlepin/candlepin/commit/f4d93230e58b969c506b4c9778e04482a059b08c>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=908613#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-03-26 19:17:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.2  Via RHSA-2013:0686 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0686.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=908613#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-07-26 07:38:29 UTC  ``` The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having moderate security impact in CloudForms 1.1. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
The production/stage public candlepin certificate is now packaged in the
RPM. This is flagged as a config file but *without* noreplace, so any
deployment using their own upstream cert (we don't think there are any)
will have to restore it from the rpmsave file that results after a
candlepin rpm upgrade. This was done because we expect this to be the
desired behavior, there is no known usecase for using your own
upstream cert at this time.
```

## Topic

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager 1.2.1, which fixes several security
issues, multiple bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager acts as a proxy for handling
subscription information and software updates on client machines.

The latest packages for Subscription Asset Manager include a number of security
fixes:

When a Subscription Asset Manager instance is created, its configuration
script automatically creates an RPM of the internal subscription service
CA certificate. However, this RPM incorrectly created the CA certificate
with file permissions of 0666. This allowed other users on a client system
to modify the CA certificate used to trust the remote subscription server.
All administrators are advised to update and deploy the subscription
service certificate on all systems which use Subscription Asset Manager
as their subscription service. This procedure is described in:
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Asset_Manager/1.2/html/Installation_Guide/sect-Installation_Guide-Administration-Upgrading_Subscription_Asset_Manager.html> (CVE-2012-6116)

Manifest signature checking was not implemented for early versions of
Subscription Asset Manager. This meant that a malicious user could edit
a manifest file, insert arbitrary data, and successfully upload the edited
manifest file into the Subscription Asset Manager server. (CVE-2012-6119)

Ruby's documentation generator had a flaw in the way it generated HTML
documentation. When a Ruby application exposed its documentation
on a network (such as a web page), an attacker could use a specially-
crafted URL to open an arbitrary web script or to execute HTML code
within the application's user session. (CVE-2013-0256)

A timing attack flaw was found in the way rubygem-rack and
ruby193-rubygem-rack processed HMAC digests in cookies. This flaw could aid
an attacker using forged digital signatures to bypass authentication
checks. (CVE-2013-0263)

A flaw in rubygem-json allowed remote attacks by creating different types
of malicious objects. For example, it could initiate a denial of service
(DoS) attack through resource consumption by using a JSON document to
create arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected. It
could also be exploited to create internal objects which could allow a SQL
injection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)

A flaw in ActiveRecord in Ruby on Rails allowed remote attackers to
circumvent attribute protections and to insert their own crafted requests
to change protected attribute values. (CVE-2013-0276)

HTML markup was not properly escaped when filling in the username field in
the Notifications form of the Subscription Asset Manager UI. This meant
that HTML code used in the value was then applied in the UI page when the
entry was viewed. This could have allowed malicious HTML code to be
entered. The field value is now validated and any HTML tags are escaped.
(CVE-2013-1823)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements:

* Previously, no SELinux policy for the subscription service was included

with the Subscription Asset Manager packages. The candlepin-selinux package
is now included with SELinux policies for the subscription server.
(BZ#906901)

* When attempting to use the subscription service's CA certificate to

validate a manifest during import, the comparison failed. The upstream
subscription service which generated the manifest is a different service
than the local subscription service; thus, they have different CA
certificates. This caused importing a manifest to fail with the error
'archive failed signature'. This has been fixed so that the proper
certificate is used for verification. (BZ#918778)

All users of Subscription Asset Manager are recommended to update to the
latest packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-08 05:19:00 UTC  ``` Aaron Patterson of Ruby on Rails project reports:   Denial of Service and Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability in JSON  There is a denial of service and unsafe object creation vulnerability in the  json gem. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier  [CVE-2013-0269](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0269).  Versions Affected:  All. This includes JSON that ships with Ruby 1.9.X-pXXX Not affected:       NONE Fixed Versions:     1.7.7, 1.6.8, 1.5.5  Impact  ------  When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in to  creating Ruby symbols in a target system.  Since Ruby symbols are not garbage  collected, this can result in a denial of service attack.  The same technique can be used to create objects in a target system that act  like internal objects.  These "act alike" objects can be used to bypass  certain security mechanisms and can be used as a spring board for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails.  Impacted code looks like this:      JSON.parse(user_input)  Where the `user_input` variable will have a JSON document like this:      {"json_class":"foo"}  The JSON gem will attempt to look up the constant "foo".  Looking up this  constant will create a symbol.  In JSON version 1.7.x, objects with arbitrary attributes can be created using  JSON documents like this:      {"json_class":"JSON::GenericObject","foo":"bar"}  This document will result in an instance of JSON::GenericObject, with the  attribute "foo" that has the value "bar".  Instantiating these objects will  result in arbitrary symbol creation and in some cases can be used to bypass  security measures.  PLEASE NOTE: this behavior *does not change* when using `JSON.load`.   `JSON.load` should *never* be given input from unknown sources.  If you are  processing JSON from an unknown source, *always* use `JSON.parse`.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the  work arounds immediately.   Releases  --------  The FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds  -----------  For users that cannot upgrade, please use the attached patches.  If you cannot  use the attached patches, change your code from this:      JSON.parse(json)  To this:      JSON.parse(json, :create_additions => false)  If you cannot change the usage of `JSON.parse` (for example you're using a gem  which depends on `JSON.parse` like multi_json), then apply this monkey patch:      module JSON       class << self         alias :old_parse :parse         def parse(json, args = {})           args[:create_additions] = false           old_parse(json, args)         end       end     end  Patches  -------  To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches  for the three supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist  of a single changeset.   * 1-7-VULN.patch - Patch for the 1.7 series * 1-6-VULN.patch - Patch for the 1.6 series * 1-5-VULN.patch - Patch for the 1.5 series  Credits  ------- * Thomas Hollstegge of Zweitag (www.zweitag.de) * Ben Murphy   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-08 05:20:35 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 694933](attachment.cgi?id=694933&action=diff "rubygem-json-1-5-CVE-2013-0269.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=694933&action=edit "rubygem-json-1-5-CVE-2013-0269.patch") rubygem-json-1-5-CVE-2013-0269.patch   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-08 05:20:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 694934](attachment.cgi?id=694934&action=diff "rubygem-json-1-6-CVE-2013-0269.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=694934&action=edit "rubygem-json-1-6-CVE-2013-0269.patch") rubygem-json-1-6-CVE-2013-0269.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-08 05:21:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 694936](attachment.cgi?id=694936&action=diff "rubygem-json-1-7-CVE-2013-0269.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=694936&action=edit "rubygem-json-1-7-CVE-2013-0269.patch") rubygem-json-1-7-CVE-2013-0269.patch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-12 07:18:55 UTC  ``` Public via:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/4_YvCpLzL58> <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/9352>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-12 10:03:28 UTC  ``` Created ruby tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 910314](show_bug.cgi?id=910314 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-0269 rubygem-json: Denial of Service and SQL Injection [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-12 10:03:33 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-json tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 910313](show_bug.cgi?id=910313 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-0269 rubygem-json: Denial of Service and SQL Injection [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 910315](show_bug.cgi?id=910315 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2013-0269 rubygem-json: Denial of Service and SQL Injection [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c14)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-02-12 10:16:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 696457](attachment.cgi?id=696457&action=diff "Updated patch for 1.7 version") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=696457&action=edit "Updated patch for 1.7 version") Updated patch for 1.7 version  Updated patch for 1.7 version from:   [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/11/8>  From [1]: Hi,  I've attached an updated patch for the JSON gem.

Since this gem is not supported from upstream now, we should update this to latest, raised regular bug for this: [bug 1862203](show_bug.cgi?id=1862203 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Satellite tools shipping old version of rubygem-json-1.4.6-2.el6")   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=909029#c38)  Yadnyawalk Tale    2020-07-31 07:08:04 UTC  ``` Added Red Hat Satellite 6 into the affect list and marked that notaffected.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=908613#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2013-02-07 07:06:11 UTC  ```  Description of problem:  User can muck with a manifest file, upload it and it will still parse (in most  reasonable cases, I imagine).   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1.  Get a manifest file. drill down into $manifest.zip > consumer_export.zip  > export > entitlements 2.  Modify the id value in the first line of the contained file.  If you want, go ahead and rename the file to match the id string you just modified. 3.  Attempt to import manifest file into CFSE    Actual results: Manifest file is imported.  Expected results: Manifest file should be rejected due to lack of signature integrity.  Additional info:   * Apparently a known backlog issue in candlepin - tracked here to assure  visibility in QE.  * Does this exist in the wild? If so, what's to stop a customer from staying  on any existing CFSE install and hacking away at a manifest to their heart's  content?  I know such changes used to get rejected.  Not sure how recent a  development this is.
