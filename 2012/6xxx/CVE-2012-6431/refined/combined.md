Symfony 2.0.20 and Symfony 2.1.5 have just been released and they both contain **two** security fixes.

## [CVE-2012-6431: Routes behind a firewall are accessible even when not logged in](#cve-2012-6431-routes-behind-a-firewall-are-accessible-even-when-not-logged-in "Permalink to this headline")

### [Affected versions](#affected-versions "Permalink to this headline")

All versions **from 2.0.0 to 2.0.19** are affected. Symfony 2.1.0 and later
are not affected by this security issue as it was fixed in [55014a6](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/55014a6841bec50046e8329a4835c160ac31a496).

### [Description](#description "Permalink to this headline")

On the Symfony 2.0.x version, there's a security issue that allows access to
routes protected by a firewall even when the user is not logged in.

Both the Routing component and the Security component uses the path returned
by `getPathInfo()` to match a Request. The `getPathInfo()` returns a
decoded path, but the Routing component
(`Symfony\Component\Routing\Matcher\UrlMatcher`) decodes the path a second
time; whereas the Security component,
`Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\RequestMatcher`, does not.

This difference causes Symfony 2.0 to be vulnerable to [double encoding attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Double_Encoding).

### [Exploits](#exploits "Permalink to this headline")

When you create a route that matches `/foo` and if you secure it in the
`security.yml` configuration file, requesting `/foo` from a browser will
redirect you to the login page if you are not already logged in. If you encode
the `f` in the URL, `/%66oo` will still be secured.

But if you double-encoded the `f`, like in `/%2566oo`, then `/%2566oo`
does not match anymore the Security rule but `/%2566oo` still matches the
Routing route (as `UrlMatcher` double-decodes the path). So, when that
happens, Symfony will render the `/foo` path even if the path is secured.

### [Resolution](#resolution "Permalink to this headline")

To avoid any other regressions in the code, we have decided to [re-encode the path](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/8b2c17f80377582287a78e0b521497e039dd6b0d.diff)
just before matching a request to prevent the double-decoding issue.

If you are using an affected version of Symfony (any 2.0 version), you must
upgrade as soon as possible by applying the following patch: [8b2c17f](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/8b2c17f80377582287a78e0b521497e039dd6b0d.diff).
If possible, we also recommend you to upgrade to Symfony 2.0.20.

### [Credits](#credits "Permalink to this headline")

I would like to thank Manuele Menozzi for reporting this security issue which
came with great explanations about the issue and how to reproduce it and
[Tobias Schultze](https://connect.sensiolabs.com/api/alternates/206c5e53-ff7b-429f-8864-dd077716a5ae)
for providing the patch.

## [CVE-2012-6432: Code execution vulnerability via the "internal" routes](#cve-2012-6432-code-execution-vulnerability-via-the-internal-routes "Permalink to this headline")

### [Affected versions](#affected-versions-1 "Permalink to this headline")

All versions of Symfony2 (2.0.X, 2.1.X, and 2.2-dev) are affected by this
issue.

Your application is vulnerable if the
`@FrameworkBundle/Resources/config/routing/internal.xml` routing file is
mounted in your routing configuration and if you have not secured its routes
properly (read below).

You can check if you are using the internal routes easily by running the
following command:

```
1
2
```
```
$ php ./app/console cache:clear
$ php ./app/console router:debug _internal
```

If you have an error that says `The route "_internal" does not exist.`, you
are not vulnerable.

### [Description and Exploits](#description-and-exploits "Permalink to this headline")

For handling ESIs (via the `render` tag), Symfony uses a special route named
`_internal`, defined in
`@FrameworkBundle/Resources/config/routing/internal.xml`.

As of Symfony 2.1, the internal routing file defines an additional route,
`_internal_public`, to be able to manage HIncludes (also via the `render`
tag).

As the `_internal` route must only be used to route URLs between your PHP
application and a reverse proxy, it must be secured to avoid any access from a
browser. But the `_internal_public` route must always be available from a
browser as it should be reachable by your frontend JavaScript (of course only
if you are using HIncludes in your application).

These two routes execute the same `FrameworkBundle:Internal:index`
controller which in turn executes the controller passed as an argument in the
URL. If these routes are reachable by a browser, an attacker could call them
to execute protected controllers or any other service (as a controller can
also be defined as a service).

### [Resolution](#resolution-1 "Permalink to this headline")

For Symfony 2.0 and 2.1, we made two changes:

* The `FrameworkBundle:Internal:index` controller now only executes services
  for which the class name ends with `Controller` (it throws an exception
  otherwise). That limits drastically the number of classes that can be called
  by an attacker (if some of your controllers do not end with `Controller`,
  keep reading to learn how to fix them). You must understand that this change
  do not freed you from doing what is described in the next section (see
  [1f8c501](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/1f8c501b998368db204176294b078df1484a10ed)
  for the actual changes in the Symfony code).
* The `render` tag now allows the usage of [absolute URLs](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/532cc9a0e656a6ebecf82d0f64d7dad6a365e1c8)
  as a first argument (see the section below to learn how it helps when
  solving the problem in your code).

For the upcoming Symfony 2.2 version, we have taken several drastic actions to
remove this problem altogether:

* The `render` tag now only takes a URI as an argument and does not support
  controller names anymore (this means that all the fragments rendered for
  ESIs and HIncludes must have associated routes);
* The `@FrameworkBundle/Resources/config/routing/internal.xml` and
  `Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\InternalController` files have
  been removed as we don't need to generate internal routes anymore;

Have a look at the changes we made in [64d43c8](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/64d43c806bc1c00dda536305565d8aaa3d07b699)
for a more detailed explanation of what we changed for 2.2.

For the Symfony Standard Edition, we have [tweaked](https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard/commit/04c1e6611b1369a3a8c6f65995dc47490a10b9ed) the comments to
warn developers about this issue.

### [Protecting your Code](#protecting-your-code "Permalink to this headline")

Upgrading to the latest version of Symfony **won't fix** the issue. You
**must** act according to the actions described below.

Depending on what you are using in your application, you have several options
to resolve this issue :

* **Do not use the internal routes**: If you are using Symfony 2.0 or Symfony
  2.1 **without** HIncludes, and if you are **not** using the `standalone`
  option for the `render` tag, you can just remove the internal routes
  configuration from your routing files to protect yourself. You can check
  that you've done the right thing by executing the following commands (the
  second command must throw an error):

  ```
  1
  2
  ```
  ```
  $ php ./app/console cache:clear
  $ php ./app/console router:debug _internal
  ```
* **Restrict access to the internal routes**: If you are using Symfony 2.0 or
  Symfony 2.1 **without** HIncludes, and if you are using the `standalone`
  option for the `render` tag, you must restrict access to the internal
  routes via your reverse proxy. Here is an example for Varnish:

  ```
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  ```
  ```
  import urlcode;

  vcl_recv {
      if (urlcode.decode(req.url) ~ "^/_internal") {
          error 403 "No Access";
      }
  }
  ```

  And another one for Nginx:

  ```
  1
  2
  3
  ```
  ```
  location ^~ /_internal {
      return 403;
  }
  ```
* **Updade your code**: In all other cases, you must update your code by doing
  the following steps:

  + **Step 1**: Upgrade to Symfony 2.0.20 or 2.1.5 (or the most current commit
    if you are using Symfony 2.2-dev) depending on which version of Symfony
    you are using (upgrading greatly mitigates the vulnerability and should be
    done as soon as possible -- the remaining steps removes the
    vulnerability for good);
  + **Step 2**: Remove the internal routes configuration from your routing
    files;
  + **Step 3**: Check that the internal routes are not configured anymore by
    running the following commands (the second command must throw an error):

    ```
    1
    2
    ```
    ```
    $ php ./app/console cache:clear
    $ php ./app/console router:debug _internal
    ```
  + **Step 4**: Find all calls to the `render` tag in your templates. As an
    example, here is the command you can use on a Unix-like system:

    ```
    1
    ```
    ```
    $ find src/ -name "*.twig" -exec grep "{% render" {} \; -print
    ```
  + **Step 5**: Create a route for each controller used in a `render` tag.
    The public URL for the new route can be anything you like but here are
    some recommendations:

    - Add a special prefix/suffix to the pattern to better identify all routes
      that point to controllers that should only be used to generate
      "fragments" of content (`/fragment/XXX` or `/XXX/YYY_fragment`);
    - If the controller for the sub-request renders a content that will be
      included in a page that is secured, apply the same security
      configuration (for instance, if the main page is secured by a Symfony
      firewall because its path starts with `/secure`, use the same
      `/secure` prefix for the sub-request controller route path).
  + **Step 6**: Replace each `render` call as follows:

    Before:

    ```
    1
    2
    3
    4
    ```
    ```
    {% render "SomeBundle:Controller:action" %}

    {# render call with some arguments #}
    {% render "SomeBundle:Controller:action" with { 'param': 1 }, { 'standalone': true } %}
    ```

    After:

    ```
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    ```
    ```
    {# the route should have been created at step 5 #}
    {% render url("path_to_controller_router") %}

    {# the with argument is needed but ignored #}
    {% render url("path_to_controller_router", { 'param': 1 }) with {}, { 'standalone': true } %}
    ```
  + **Step 7**: Check that your application still works fine and deploy.

Fabien, the first setence is not really correct because only Symfony 2.1 contains *two* security fixes (2.0 only one).

Massimiliano,

I noticed this a few days ago. If you go into your config.yml and add "trusted\_proxies: ~" under the "framework:" section, it should fix it.

However, you might want to investigate more before blindly including that setting. Pretty sure it enables "trust all proxies", which could result in users tampering with their reported IP address.

The above instructions (removing the \_internal route from routing files and modifying use of the render tag in Twig templates) seems to completely break if you are using 2.1.5 with ESI switched on, because the call to getInternalUri() is still made within the HttpKernel object, which still references the \_internal route.

Unfortunately, as Kevin and Douglas mentioned, if you are using ESI and want to disable the \_internal route, it won't work as is. This has been fixed now in all Symfony versions. I will probably release a new version of Symfony 2.0 and 2.1 tomorrow. In the meantime, keeping the \_internal routes and protecting them via Nginx or Varnish work.

Hello, I have updated to version 2.1.5 and 2.1.6 and the last two I have stopped working properly the method 'bind' forms. If I go back to version 2.1.4 again bindear data correctly. Have you made ‚Äã‚Äãany changes in this regard?

@Kousuke Fabien has made a pull request to the security document with the needed details and I've just merged it in - it should render on the site shortly at <http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/security.html#security-advisories>.

Hugo has also done a PR to the documentation so we can update any language needed - see <https://github.com/symfony/symfony-docs/pull/2057> - I'll work on that, merge it shortly, and we'll make any other changes needed going forward.

Thanks!
