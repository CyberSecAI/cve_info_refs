Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `futex_wait_requeue_pi()` function within the Linux kernel's futex subsystem. This function is designed to handle the requeueing of a waiting task from a non-priority inheritance (PI) futex to a PI-aware futex. The core issue arises when the source address (`uaddr`) and the destination address (`uaddr2`) are the same. This violates the intended behavior where the requeue should only occur from a non-PI futex to a different PI futex, causing a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Requeue Logic:** The code doesn't properly validate that `uaddr` and `uaddr2` are different addresses before attempting the requeue operation.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** When `uaddr` and `uaddr2` are the same, the code misses early wakeups, because `q.key` is equal to `key2`, leading to the attempt of dereferencing a `pi_mutex` that doesn't exist (as it would have if the futex had been properly requeued to a PI-aware futex). This results in a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Crash:** An unprivileged local user can trigger this flaw, causing a kernel crash and a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected system.
- **Loss of Availability:** A successful exploit will render the system unusable, as it crashes due to the kernel panic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system, as it involves making system calls that can only be performed from within the system.
- **Specifically crafted system calls:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI` operation, so an attacker must be able to invoke it with identical `uaddr` and `uaddr2`. This would usually involve a crafted program, making specific system calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** An unprivileged user with the ability to execute code on the target system.
- **Knowledge of futex usage:** The attacker should be able to craft the specific futex system calls.
- **Ability to Trigger `FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI`:** The attacker must be able to make the `FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI` syscall with `uaddr == uaddr2`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced with the support for PI-aware futexes.
- The fix includes a simple check to ensure that `uaddr` and `uaddr2` are not the same, resulting in an error when they are.
- The Red Hat bugzilla entry indicates that this issue affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and was fixed in RHSA-2014:0981.
- The vulnerability was found by the Trinity test suite, which highlights its potential exposure.
- This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 7 or Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.
- The provided commit log details that a `WARN_ON` test was also fixed along with the main vulnerability in futex_wait_requeue_pi().

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, particularly by specifying the vulnerable function and the precise condition that causes the null pointer dereference.
