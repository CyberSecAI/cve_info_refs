{
  "CVE-2012-6656": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the character set conversion code for IBM multi-byte code pages when converting from IBM930 to UTF-8.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds array access due to insufficient validation of multibyte characters in the input stream.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A crash or denial of service can occur. In some scenarios, this could lead to a remote denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted input sequence when converting from IBM930 to UTF-8 using the `iconv()` function.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to control the input to `iconv()` function that converts from IBM930. No specific privilege is required."
  },
 "CVE-2014-6040": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the character set conversion code for various IBM multi-byte code pages (IBM933, IBM935, IBM937, IBM939, IBM1364). The code does not properly validate the index value during character conversion.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds array access due to insufficient bounds checking when accessing conversion tables in the code. Specifically, when a ch value of 0xffff is encountered",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A crash or denial of service can occur, as the out-of-bounds read leads to a segmentation fault.",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted input sequence to the iconv function that contains the invalid multibyte character 0xffff when converting from one of the affected IBM code pages to UTF-8.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the input to the `iconv` function and cause a conversion from one of the vulnerable IBM code pages to UTF-8"
