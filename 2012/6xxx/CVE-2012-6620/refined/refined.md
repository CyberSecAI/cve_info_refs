The provided content relates to CVE-2012-6620.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the task description field within the Kronolith (Horde calendar application) module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into task descriptions. This code is then executed when other users view the task list or interact with the affected elements.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing the application interface
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can create a new task or modify an existing task and include malicious JavaScript in the task description field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify task entries in Kronolith to inject the malicious code. This likely requires having a valid account on the Horde platform.
