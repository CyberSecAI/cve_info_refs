[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0148)

## Topic

Updated spacewalk-java, spacewalk-web, and satellite-branding packages that
fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat Satellite 5.6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Satellite is a systems management tool for Linux-based
infrastructures. It allows for provisioning, remote management and
monitoring of multiple Linux deployments with a single, centralized tool.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the Red Hat
Satellite web interface performed sanitization of notes for registered
systems. A remote authenticated Red Hat Satellite user could create a
malicious note that, when viewed by a victim, could execute arbitrary web
script with the privileges of the user viewing that note. (CVE-2012-6149)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in the Red Hat
Satellite web interface. A remote attacker could provide a specially
crafted link that, when visited by an authenticated Red Hat Satellite user,
would lead to arbitrary web script execution in the context of the user's
web interface session. (CVE-2013-1871, CVE-2013-4415)

An HTTP header injection flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Satellite
web interface processed the return URL parameter for all HTTP GET requests.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
and HTTP response splitting attacks against users visiting the site.
(CVE-2013-1869)

Red Hat would like to thank Ben Ford of Puppet Labs for reporting
CVE-2012-6149, Ryan Giobbi of UPMC for reporting CVE-2013-1869 and
CVE-2013-1871, and Adam Willard and Jose Carlos de Arriba of Foreground
Security for reporting CVE-2013-4415.

Users of Red Hat Satellite 5.6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. For this update to take effect, Red
Hat Satellite must be restarted. Refer to the Solution section for details.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

| [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=882000#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-12-03 15:21:37 UTC  ``` A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the web interface of Red Hat Network Satellite / Spacewalk performed sanitization of note's subject and note's content values, for a note being added after system.addNote() XML-RPC request. A remote authenticated Red Hat Network Satellite / Spacewalk user (having systems registered to particular Red Hat Network Satellite / Spacewalk instance) could use this flaw to execute arbitrary HTML or web script, via specially-crafted XML-RPC request, in the context of the session of Red Hat Network Satellite / Spacewalk administrator, if they visited the page, created as a result of that XML-RPC call.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=882000#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-12-10 17:53:18 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Ford of Puppet Labs for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=882000#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-10 17:32:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Satellite Server v 5.6  Via RHSA-2014:0148 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0148.html>   ``` |  |

Remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page that, when visited by authenticated Red Hat Satellite or Spacewalk user would lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the context of Red Hat Satellite's / Spacewalk's user's session.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=979452#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-07-18 14:41:06 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Adam Willard and Jose Carlos de Arriba of Foreground Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=979452#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2013-10-10 01:05:16 UTC  ``` The root cause of this issue is within PAGE_SIZE_LABEL_SELECTED.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=979452#c14)  Grant Gainey    2014-01-24 15:46:13 UTC  ``` commits: fca790234a2d15e7e09875dab5ab5890aba6c593 (majority of the changes) bb9b185143cae97537f0f946bcbfae0252aaf301 (LABEL_SELECTED fix) cafa97d07dd5c0cf6ffda8daa28bcba8e53d6451 (make checkstyle happy) 0d5abafa7732aa74206389c1463888f11282fcf6 (fix satellite-branding)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=979452#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-10 17:33:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Satellite Server v 5.6  Via RHSA-2014:0148 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0148.html>   ``` |  |

A remote authenticated Red Hat Network Satellite / Spacewalk user (having systems registered to particular Red Hat Network Satellite / Spacewalk instance) could use this flaw to execute arbitrary HTML or web script, via specially-crafted XML-RPC request, in the context of the session of Red Hat Network Satellite / Spacewalk administrator, if they visited the page, created as a result of that XML-RPC call.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=882000#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-12-10 17:53:18 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Ford of Puppet Labs for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=882000#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-02-10 17:32:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Satellite Server v 5.6  Via RHSA-2014:0148 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0148.html>   ``` |  |
