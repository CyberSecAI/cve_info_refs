well, it’s only fair that most the essential functionalities are not for free. but the free version answers the basic needs i guess. so 7/10, i would say…

Ce plugin est complet et très flexible. Il est idéal pour les cabinets de recrutement.

I really wish we were able to use this plugin, because it looked great! But after running into some bugs with getting applications not submitting, we hit the support forums. The replies never helped get the issue corrected. So we went with another plugin that worked great for what we were doing.

Simple to implement.

This is probably a great plugin for those that it works for. On the site I attempted to use it on, I spent hours crafting the job roles and application, but when you submit the application it gives a complex PHP error. I reached out to support and never received an answer after a week, and I don’t anticipate getting one, which is a shame.

Forget any other job board plugins. This one does all you need. Fully customizable. Just works straight out of the box.
