Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-6524

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `kommentar.php` file of pGB version 2.12.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input before being used in a SQL query within the `kommentar.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- It could potentially allow an attacker to modify or delete data within the database.
- In some cases, a full compromise of the application might be possible through SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP request to the vulnerable `kommentar.php` file.
- Specifically, the `id` parameter within the URL is susceptible to SQL injection.
- An attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter (e.g., by appending `'`).
- The application then executes the malicious SQL code against the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target web server hosting the pGB application.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement, so it can likely be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL and HTTP.

**Summary**
The exploit-db entry provides a concise description of the SQL injection vulnerability in `kommentar.php` of pGB 2.12, along with demo site URL. The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the request to `kommentar.php`, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification or potential full application compromise. The attacker can exploit this using HTTP request.
