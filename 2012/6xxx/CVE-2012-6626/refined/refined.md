- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `verify-user.php` file. The application directly uses user-supplied input in an SQL query without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the username input is directly embedded into an SQL query without sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This leads to an authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a remote attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the login form. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the username field, which is then passed to the SQL query.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login form of the vulnerable web application and manipulate the username field.
