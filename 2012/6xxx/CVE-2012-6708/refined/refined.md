{
  "CVE-2012-6708": {
    "Description": "The jQuery(strInput) function does not reliably differentiate selectors from HTML. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.",
    "Root cause": "The `jQuery(strInput)` function in jQuery versions prior to 1.9.1 incorrectly identifies HTML strings by searching for the '<' character anywhere within the string, instead of strictly requiring it to be the first character.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the victim's browser due to the vulnerable interpretation of input by the jQuery function.",
    "Attack vector": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a string that is later used as input to the vulnerable jQuery function, and be able to trick a user into interacting with the vulnerable code."
