## Installation

Starting with Yoast SEO consists of just two steps: installing and setting up the plugin. Yoast SEO is designed to work with your site’s specific needs, so don’t forget to go through the Yoast SEO first-time configuration as explained in the ‘after activation’ step! For the most up-to-date guidance on how to install Yoast SEO products, [please visit our help center](https://yoast.com/help/yoast-installation-manuals/#h-yoast-seo-and-yoast-seo-premium-for-wordpress).

## FAQ

### How do the XML Sitemaps in the Yoast SEO plugin work?

Having an XML sitemap can be beneficial for SEO, as Google can retrieve essential pages of a website very fast, even if the internal linking of a site isn’t flawless.

The sitemap index and individual sitemaps are updated automatically as you add or remove content and will include the post types you want search engines to index. Post Types marked as noindex will not appear in the sitemap. [Learn more about XML Sitemaps](https://yoa.st/3qt).

### How can I add my website to Google Search Console?

It is straightforward to add your website to Google Search Console.

1. Create a Google Search Console account and login into your account.

2. Click ‘Add a property’ under the search drop-down.

3. Enter your website URL in the box and click ‘Continue’.

4. Click the arrow next to ‘HTML tag’ to expand the option.

5. Copy the meta tag.

6. Log in to your WordPress website.

7. Click on ‘SEO’ in the dashboard.

8. Click on ‘General’.

9. Click on the ‘Webmaster Tools’ tab.

10. Paste the code in the Google field and click ‘Save Changes’.

11. Go back to Google Search Console and click ‘Verify’.

If you want more details steps, please visit [our article on our help center](https://yoa.st/3qu).

### How do I implement Yoast SEO breadcrumbs?

The steps below are a temporary solution as manual edits made to theme files may be overwritten with future theme updates. Please contact the theme developer for a permanent solution. We’ve written an article about the [importance of breadcrumbs for SEO](https://yoa.st/3qv).

To implement the [breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qw) function in Yoast SEO, you will have to edit your theme. We recommend that prior to any editing of the theme files, a backup is taken. Your host provider can help you take a backup.

Copy the following code into your theme where you want the breadcrumbs to be. If you are not sure, you will need to experiment with placement:

```
<?php
if ( function_exists( 'yoast_breadcrumb' ) ) {
    yoast_breadcrumb( '<p id="breadcrumbs">','</p>' );
}
?>

```

Common places where you could place your breadcrumbs are inside your `single.php` and/or `page.php` file just above the page’s title. Another option that makes it really easy in some themes is by just pasting the code in `header.php` at the very end.

In most non-WooTheme themes, this code snippet should not be added to your `functions.php` file.

Alternatively, you can manually add the breadcrumb shortcode to individual posts or pages: `[wpseo_breadcrumb]`

If you need more details or a step by step guide, read our [Implementation guide for Yoast SEO breadcrumbs](https://yoa.st/3qx).

### How do I noindex URLS?

Yoast SEO provides multiple options for setting a URL or group of URLs to noindex. [Read more about how to do this in this guide](https://yoa.st/3qy/).

### Google shows the wrong description, how do I fix this?

If you’ve crafted nice meta descriptions for your blog posts, nothing is more annoying than Google showing another description for your site completely in the search result snippet.

Possible causes could be:

1. wrong description in code

2. Google cache is outdated

3. Search term manipulation

4. Google ignored the meta description

You can [read more here on how to solve the issue with the wrong description](https://yoa.st/3qz).

### How often is Yoast SEO updated?

Yoast SEO is updated every two weeks. If you want to know why, please read [this post on why we release every two weeks](https://yoa.st/3q-)!

### How do I get support?

As our free plugin is used by millions of people worldwide, we cannot offer you all one on one support. If you have trouble with the Yoast SEO for WordPress plugin, you can get help on the support forums here at [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo/) or by checking out our help center at [yoast.com/help/](https://yoa.st/3r1).

The plugins you buy at Yoast are called ‘premium plugins’ (even if Premium isn’t in its name) and include a complete year of free updates and premium support. This means you can contact our support team if you have any questions about that plugin.

2 star for the free version. Ive tried different SEO plugin I will not mentioned those names but I have publish a new website and I tried using this plugin for the 2nd time after several years but the features that were free before are now paid. Basically if you are using free version its just a bloated plugin so instead just use a different SEO plugin if you arent planning to get the premium one.
4 star for paid version. I can see a lot of good features but i dont have access since im only using free version maybe i can give this 5 star rating if im able to test out those paid features.

I remember using this plugin a long time ago. Now I’ve come back to it for a new blog and it seems a lot more bloated than earlier versions. It still works, and is easy to use, but there are a lot of unnecessary features too. A lot of upselling and banner ads etc.

4.6 / 5](https://www.g2.com/products/yoast-yoast/reviews)

Both WordPress SEO Premium and the free version of WordPress SEO have been updated to version 2.2. This new release brings quite a few changes and some nice new additions. We’ll explain the changes in this post.

## Security fixes

This release contains a fix for a potential XSS issue in the admin, specifically the snippet preview. It was caused by issues in our JS, which is why also did another overhaul of our admin JS. The XSS issue required you to be logged in, so the risk level was relatively low.

## Community input

This release contains code that was suggested by 5 people outside of the core WordPress SEO development team. We particularly want to highlight and thank [Gary Jones](http://www.garyjones.co.uk/about) as he’s done several great suggestions for this release. We’ve also had great feedback from Gary and several others on how to improve the accessibility of the plugin, all of those changes are incorporated in this release.

## No more tracking class

We’ve removed our external tracking. We were doing opt-in tracking of a couple hundred thousand sites, but as WordPress.org is improving how it does its stats, we’d rather focus on other things. This means we’ll no longer give you a popup asking for permission on new installs.

## Recognize your redirects

Recently, while Joost was helping on a major domain migration, he couldn’t locate which bit of code was creating a particular redirect. Annoying as this was, he decided it was time to invent a new HTTP header, to be sent right before a redirect header. This header, X-Redirect-By, identifies the piece of software that created the redirect. We’ve implemented it in WordPress SEO immediately and hope it’ll save a few of our users a headache at some time.

## Premium: better redirect notices

We improved the notices that urge you to redirect changed / deleted posts and terms if you’re using [WordPress SEO Premium](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/). These should help you to *keep* your site optimized. If you’re not using WordPress SEO Premium yet, you really should consider it. Not only will you get more features and support from our team, you’ll also help fund the further development of the entire plugin.

## Integration with other plugins

We love it when plugins integrate nicely with our SEO plugin. [Nested Pages](https://nestedpages.com/) is one of those. It’s an intuitive drag and drop interface for pages in the admin. It’s so nice, we dare say it’s what the WordPress interface *should* look like. When you run WordPress SEO, it highlights the SEO score (through our simple color coded circles) right on the overview.

Joost recently submitted a patch for Nested Pages so it will show blue for noindexed pages, a patch that was [promptly accepted](https://github.com/kylephillips/wp-nested-pages/pull/111). We love open source!

We’ve done some work in this release to make sure that we in turn integrate well with Nested Pages. This means that when you delete a page, the notice you get to redirect the URL will work, which it didn’t before because you weren’t on the normal edit pages screen.

## Other bugfixes & changes

A couple of the changes we’ve done:

**Redirect to about**
Quite a few people complained about the redirect to our about page after an update. We’ve heard you and changed how it works. You’ll now get a dismissible notice with a link to the release notes, we’ll no longer redirect you.

**Fixed multisite settings import**You should now be able to properly import settings on multisite environments.

**Facebook Insights authentication**Next to moving this to the bottom of the Facebook tab (it’s not *that* important), we’ve changed how you can authenticate to get access to Facebook insights. [This knowledge base article](https://yoast.com/facebook-page-insights/) is probably the best explanation. If you were already authenticated you don’t need to change anything.

**Under the hood**Also in this release, we’ve cleaned up all our JavaScript and, more important: documented all of it and made sure it no longer gives JS Hint warnings. We did more cleanup like this, in our continuous effort to both write better code and improve how we do so.

## News SEO

Our [News SEO plugin](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/) has had a small update too, fixing some sitemap caching issues people were having. If you don’t know our other premium SEO plugins, [check them out](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/).

   My WordPress iOS app will not work ever since I updated this plugin. I get an internal server error. This is a pain because I use my iPad and iPhone to post to my blog. I can still check comments but I can’t pull new posts. When I deactivated this plugin it works fine. I really like this plugin but it’s making it impossible to work. Do you have a resolve or how do I roll back to the previous version?

   Nicely done. I sort of miss how easy it was before to get to my .htaccess and robots.txt files, but one extra click is not that big of a deal… Thanks!

   Since this update, the og: image, og: description, etc. tags seem to have gone away. If I “view source” and do a search for og: I get nothing. I see it in the snippet preview, and in the meta-description, but it’s not writing the og: tags.

   Since updating, when we publish posts, if we update them, it sets a redirect in the yoast plugin and our updated pages produce 404 errors. Please advise.

     I have the same problem. It doesn’t always happen and I can’t predict when it does.

     You can get round it by telling it to undo the redirect, or if you miss the warning, by later deleting the redirect. But it is very annoying.

   Apparently this version added the Post List columns, highly unwanted. They clutter the post list view. Can I remove them? It was possible to hide them in previous versions by setting them hidden.

     Duh, sorry about this. Saving the settings again hid them again.

    Since upgrading, the Yoast SEO plugin CONSTANTLY pops up the “take the tour” message box, basically making all authors/editors/admins have to stop to hit “close” upon every screen they enter.

    There is no way to stop it. Completely unacceptable for any plugin to force this type of behavior within the wordpress backend interface.

    Please address with a fix, or Yoast is gone for good. Have been a supporter for years, but not after this.

      The butthurt is strong with this one.

      Things like this can happen, I’m sure he will quickly have a fix ready.

      If I was the author of this plugin I’d rather see you go than stay. “Supporter for years”.

    I would also love to point out that hitting the close button doesn’t resolve the “Start the Tour notices” and other pop-ups; can you kindly update on an easy fix for this?

    Any thoughts on bbPress and BuddyPress support. This has been brought up probably a thousand times by now and gets annoying from your POV. That being said it’s an important part for a lot of websites. The plugin does not have a proper way to set the title and description tags for bbPress or BuddyPress and it causes issues from the indexing POV.

    Also you guys should write a tutorial covering the use of plugins such as BuddyPress, bbPress, and WooCommerce to show what the optimal settings are (Sitemap wise, no follow, etc) and if you ever get support with bbPress and BuddyPress it would be nice to get a walkthrough on the recommended settings for this as well.

    “Redirect to about – gone.” THANK YOU

    It was something I would have complained about soon because after an update when you click on a certain menu item and get forcefully redirected to the release notes was really something that made me think about switching with my network and all client sites.

    So thank you for removing that. Mind you I buy premium extensions and this redirect could very soon have caused losing me as a customer. For good. So I appreciate the change.

            How come the Yoast team aren’t trying to fix this issue ?

            My website doesn’t have cache but still the Start The Tour keeps popping up. Anyupdate to fix this please ?

            Great Plugin by the way. God bless

        Unfortunately I have hit close on every page in my wordpress admin, all to no avail, upon opening another page in the admin it comes back again.

```
============================================================
Info
============================================================
Affects:         Yoast Wordpress SEO Plugin <= 2.1.1
Download URL:    <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/>
Advisory URL:    <https://inventropy.us/blog/yoast-seo-plugin-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability/>
Acknowledgement: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/changelog/>

============================================================
Description
============================================================
The "snippet preview" functionality of the Yoast WordPress SEO plugin prior to version 2.2 was susceptible to
cross-site scripting in the admin panel, related to the "metabox" functionality. This vulnerability appears to have
been reported 2 years ago by someone named "badconker" (link:
<https://wordpress.org/support/topic/security-issue-with-post-title-field-xss-vulnerability#post-3575617>), but the
plugin author said that it had already been patched at the time.

The issue can be triggered by entering arbitrary HTML into the post title field, such as in the example URL provided
below.

============================================================
Vulnerable URL
============================================================
<http://example.site/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_title=><img onerror=alert(1) src=>

============================================================
Vulnerable Code
============================================================
try {
        str = jQuery('<div/>').html(str).text();
        str = str.replace(/<\/?[^>]+>/gi, '');
        str = str.replace(/\[(.+?)\](.+?\[\/\\1\])?/g, '');
} catch (e) {}

Link: <https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/2.1.1/js/wp-seo-metabox.js#L1-13>

============================================================
Fix
============================================================
Updating to the latest version (2.2.1 at the time of this advisory) will fix this issue.

  WordPress SEO version: 1.2.8.7

  I did this:

  i filled the field post\_title of a page/post/custom\_post with “<script>alert(‘We have a problem’);</script>”

  I expected the plugin to do this: nothing in particular

  Instead it did this:

  A popup message “We have a problem”.

  On my site, everyone can make a post. This post is then validate by an admin user. So everyone can use the security breach to execute javascript in admin !

  Temporary patch :

  Hi,

  Thanks for your new version but a have tested again with WordPress 3.5 and wordpress-seo 1.3.3 (and developper version…) it seems to be not resolved at all !! ( specifically in wp-seo-metabox.js)

  Simple test :

  – connect you on admin of your site

  – go to url : `[www.yoursite.com]/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_title=<script>alert('There is a problem');</script>`

  – The alert message is displaying !

  => CSRF : <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery>

  For me, it’s a big security issue.

# Yoast SEO Plugin Authenticated, Stored XSS Vulnerability

[![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/277edd2b22c2f16340710f951cc296ca?s=44&d=mm&r=pg)](https://techiavellian.com/author/charles "Posts by Techiavellian")

The “snippet preview” functionality of the [Yoast WordPress SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) plugin was susceptible to cross-site scripting in versions before 2.2 (<= 2.1.1). This vulnerability [appears to have been reported 2 years ago](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/security-issue-with-post-title-field-xss-vulnerability#post-3575617) by someone named “badconker”, but the plugin author said that it was already patched. Unfortunately, it appears that this is not the case. **If you are running this plugin, I recommend updating to [the latest version](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/releases).**

[![Yoast WordPress SEO XSS in action](https://techiavellian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/yoast_xss-1024x862.png)](https://techiavellian.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/yoast_xss.png)

Yoast WordPress SEO XSS in action

**Vulnerable URL:**

```
/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_title=<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

**Vulnerable Code (**wordpress-seo/js/wp-seo-metabox.js)**:**

```
function yst_clean(str) {
    	if (str == '' || str == undefined)
		    return '';

	    try {
		        str = jQuery('<div/>').html(str).text();
		        str = str.replace(/<\/?[^>]+>/gi, '');
		        str = str.replace(/\[(.+?)\](.+?\[\/\\1\])?/g, '');
	    } catch (e) {
	}

	return str;
}
```

( **[Link](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/2.1.1/js/wp-seo-metabox.js#L1-13)** )

```
function sanitize_title( title ) {
    	// Run possibly set filters
    	title = wpseo_apply_filter( title, 'title');

    	title = yst_clean(title);

    	// and now the snippet preview title
    	title = yst_boldKeywords(title, false);

    	return title;
}
```

( **[Link](https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/2.1.1/js/wp-seo-metabox.js#L243-251)** )

The vulnerable part is on line 6 of **wordpress-seo/js/wp-seo-metabox.js** where the yst\_clean function passes the “str” parameter to the jQuery .html() function, then tries to get the text from that object. This means that any HTML will be executed when it is passed through the sanitization function.

It seems the fix introduced in 2.2 was to move the .html() call below the regex replacements:

```
	try {
    		str = str.replace( /<\/?[^>]+>/gi, '' );
    		str = str.replace( /\[(.+?)](.+?\[\/\\1])?/g, '' );
    		str = jQuery( '<div/>' ).html( str ).text();
	}
```

   I have been used this plugin, but switched to All in one SEO. Great alternative, maybe even better then Yoast.
