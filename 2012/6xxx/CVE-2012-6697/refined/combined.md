# InspIRCd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201512-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in InspIRCd, the worst
allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-irc/inspircd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.20** |

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All InspIRCd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-irc/inspircd-2.0.20"

Subject: inspircd: CVE-2012-1836 patch incorrect
Date: Fri, 20 Mar 2015 22:05:29 +0000
```
Package: inspircd
Version: 2.0.5-1+b1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi,

I am an upstream maintainer for InspIRCd. The patch you have for [CVE-2012-1836](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1836) (patches/03_CVE-2012-1836.diff) is not the same patch
we released as part of 2.0.7 (there was no 2.0.6) to address the CVE. It appears to be a a version of this commit: <https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/commit/9aa28f3730fb3dd69c1e06f78bb2bbc43d36c684>.
However this commit was never in a release, and was only in git for about 6 days (due to someone other than me pulling it in). I looked at the CVE and addressed it with two followup
commits later.

This commit and your patch do not fix the problem. You can still send maliciously crafted packets and cause remote code execution. This was fixed
in <https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/commit/ed28c1ba666b39581adb860bf51cdde43c84cc89>, prior to the 2.0.7 release.

Furthermore, your patch introduces a buffer underflow where it has "i =- 12" and not "i -= 12". This causes it to start reading from before the packet's buffer. It is unclear
to me what this can cause.

Additionally, at the same time I commited 58c893e834ff20495d007709220881a3ff13f423 to prevent malicious packets from causing InspIRCd to infinite loop. This is not a part of the CVE
as it does not allow remote code execution, but is still a critical problem due to the potential for denial of service.

You should perhaps apply these two patches on top of your existing ones, or maybe fetch the dns.cpp file off of 2.0.7 here: <https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/blob/v2.0.7/src/dns.cpp>.
It does not change much.

I would be willing to go through and provide a proper set of patches for this and other less-severe issues if requested. I do not want to do it up front because it would be a lot
of work, and I am not sure whether or not it would be accepted. You have a very, very old InspIRCd version, and there is a lot of stuff to sift through (about 3 years). Let me know.

Thanks,

Adam

I'll try to apply diff for src/dns.cpp between the 2.0.5 and 2.0.7
releases as you suggest it and will test (yes i use personally use
inspircd).
When done, i'll contact the Debian security team for an upload in the
security archive.

As the new stable version Debian 8 Jessie is to be freezed/released, i
don't think i'll find a sponsor to upload a 2.0.17 backport of inspircd
for the current Debian 7 Wheezy.

Subject: squeeze update of inspircd?
Date: Fri, 10 Apr 2015 21:50:44 +0200
```
Hello dear maintainer(s),

the Debian LTS team would like to fix the security issues which are
currently open in the Squeeze version of inspircd:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/inspircd>

Would you like to take care of this yourself? We are still understaffed so
any help is always highly appreciated.

If yes, please follow the workflow we have defined here:
<http://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development>

If that workflow is a burden to you, feel free to just prepare an
updated source package and send it to debian-lts@lists.debian.org
(via a debdiff, or with an URL pointing to the the source package,
or even with a pointer to your packaging repository), and the members
of the LTS team will take care of the rest. Indicate clearly whether you
have tested the updated package or not.

If you don't want to take care of this update, it's not a problem, we
will do our best with your package. Just let us know whether you would
like to review and/or test the updated package before it gets released.

Thank you very much.

Raphaël Hertzog,
  on behalf of the Debian LTS team.

PS: A member of the LTS team might start working on this update at
any point in time. You can verify whether someone is registered

Hi,

InspIRCd is a rather fast moving project. 1.1 has been considered EOL by us
for over 6 years (and considered old for 8), and we dont have anyone left
who developed 1.1, or have anyone with any working knowledge of it in any
way as far as Im aware. If you want to patch it youre on your own, we
would recommend removing the package. We think that there are other major
problems with it, but weve forgotten what they are.

As far as 2.0.5, I have combined the various commits in the original report
here:
<https://github.com/Adam-/inspircd/commit/e953a402add27edfbb31337ee6510b79462>
a3c96. I have also made an entire branch forked off of 2.0.5 including
important fixes seen here: <https://github.com/Adam-/inspircd/commits/debian7>
if you choose to take any of them. The other fixes here are non-security
related, but are stability related.

I do not wish to directly fix this myself, but am open to questions/support
etc.

Adam

Package        : inspircd
Debian Bug     : 780880

adam@anope.org discovered several problems in inspircd, an IRC daemon:

  - an incomplete patch for CVE-2012-1836 failed to adequately resolve
    the problem where maliciously crafted DNS requests could lead to
    remote code execution through a heap-based buffer overflow.

  - the incorrect processing of specific DNS packets could trigger an
    infinite loop, thus resulting in a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.5-1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.0.16-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your inspircd packages.
