Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of input data in the Google Spellchecker plugin for TinyMCE. Specifically, the plugin failed to properly sanitize the language parameter (`lang`) and the input string (`str`) before sending them to Google's spell check API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `lang` parameter was only checked for `a-z` or `-` characters, while the `str` parameter was not sanitized against control characters.
*   **Potential for Exploitation:** This lack of proper sanitization could allow an attacker to inject malicious data via these parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection:** The primary risk is the possibility of code injection, potentially enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code by injecting specific characters. The details of the code injection are not explicit but the possibility exists given the lack of proper sanitization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Requests:** Attackers could inject malicious code into the `lang` or `str` parameter of the HTTP request sent to Google's spellcheck API. This would then be processed by the vulnerable code.
*   **Web Application:** The vulnerability can be exploited through any web application that uses the vulnerable TinyMCE spellchecker plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with a web application using the vulnerable TinyMCE plugin.
*   The attacker must be able to manipulate the input fields and trigger the spell check functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involved sanitizing the `lang` parameter by removing all characters except `a-z` and `-`, and sanitizing the `str` parameter to remove control characters (`\x00-\x1F\x7F`).
*   The Moodle security advisory MSA-13-0001 mentions that this fix has been applied to Moodle, and that the severity/risk is considered "Serious".
*   The vulnerability was reported by Petr Å koda.
*   A workaround mentioned is to disable the spellchecker plugin.
