clients. For more information on IMP, visit <http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.>

The major changes compared to the IMP version H4 (5.0.21) are:
     * Only display basic image attachments in the browser to avoid XSS
       vulnerabilities triggered by opening malicious SVG attachments.
     * Re-added option to report messages as spam/ham through redirection.
     * Updated Swedish and Turkish translations.
