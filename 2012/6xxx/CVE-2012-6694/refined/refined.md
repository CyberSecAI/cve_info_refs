Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6694:

**Verification:**

The provided content, particularly the ICS-CERT advisory, directly references CVE-2012-6694 and identifies it as a vulnerability related to GE Centricity PACS Server. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of default or hard-coded credentials in various GE Healthcare products, including the Centricity PACS Server.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The primary weakness is the presence of easily guessable or default usernames and passwords which do not adhere to good security practices.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the affected devices, which could include medical imaging systems, servers, and workstations.
    *  **Data Breach:** Potential for theft of sensitive patient data, including medical records and imaging data.
    *  **System Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially alter system configurations, including radiation dosages, which could have physical consequences for patients.
   *   **Compromised Medical Devices:** The compromise of medical devices can cause severe disruption to medical services and put patient safety at risk.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability remotely by gaining access to the hospital network or through devices accessible over the web.
    *   **Internet Exposure:**  The vulnerability can be exploited if the affected systems are directly accessible from the internet, which was found to be the case in many healthcare organizations.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory explicitly states that an attacker with a low skill level could exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs some form of access to the network where the vulnerable devices are located. This could be through direct network access or potentially via compromised web facing applications.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The content provides a list of affected GE Healthcare products along with their respective CVE IDs.
*   The Forbes article details the specific default credentials found in some GE devices (e.g., "insite/2getin" for breast scanner, "root/install" for CT machine)
*   The advisory indicates that GE has released updates to address this vulnerability for most devices, but not all, and recommends mitigation steps such as disabling unused ports and restricting network access.
*   The Forbes article mentions that some documentation from GE, for some devices, specifically instructed not to change the default passwords as it could prevent GE from providing support

**Summary:**

The identified vulnerability is due to the use of easily guessable default credentials. This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to critical medical devices which could result in data breaches, manipulation of the devices, and potential harm to patients. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker with relatively low technical skills. While GE has provided updates for most products, organizations must take additional measures to mitigate the risk.
