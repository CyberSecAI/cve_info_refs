Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs, specifically within the advanced search functionality. The `select_sort` and `opt_search_select` parameters are vulnerable.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application doesn't sanitize user inputs in the search fields, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized input in the `select_sort` and `opt_search_select` parameters in the advanced search functionality allows for the injection of malicious SQL queries.
*   **Multiple XSS:** Unsanitized input in the search field, author field in advanced search, and select_sort parameters in advanced search allows for injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Potential unauthorized access to database information.
    *   Possible modification or deletion of database content, depending on database permissions.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Malicious scripts injected into the application can be used to steal session cookies or other sensitive information from users.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Attacker manipulates the `select_sort` or `opt_search_select` POST parameters within the advanced search functionality.
*   **XSS:**
    *   Attacker inputs malicious scripts directly into the search field, author field in advanced search, or `select_sort` parameter in advanced search.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the web application and its search functionalities. No special privileges are required.
*   For SQL injection, the attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to insert malicious input via the web interface.
