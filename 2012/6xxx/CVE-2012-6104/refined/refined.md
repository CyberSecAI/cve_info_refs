Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from blog posts that were hidden from guest users in the web interface being improperly included in the related RSS feed. This means that even if a blog post was intended to be private and not visible to guests on the website, it would still be accessible through the RSS feed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary weakness is the unintended exposure of private blog post content through the RSS feed to unauthorized users (guests).
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The system failed to properly apply access controls on blog posts when generating RSS feeds, thus bypassing intended privacy settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Guest users could potentially gain access to information intended for only logged in users.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The exposure of hidden blog content may lead to a violation of user privacy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **RSS Feed Access:** Attackers can access the exposed blog content via RSS feed using any RSS reader or directly through the RSS feed URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Login Required:** Attackers do not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability. Any guest user with access to the blog's RSS feed URL can potentially gain access to the hidden content.
