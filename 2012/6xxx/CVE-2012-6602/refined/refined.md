Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when processing device management commands via the command-line interface (CLI). This allows an authenticated user to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core issue is the failure to neutralize special elements used in operating system commands. This permits an attacker to inject malicious commands that will be executed by the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the affected system.
*   **Total Device Compromise:** Due to the ability to run arbitrary commands, the device can be fully compromised, allowing the attacker to control the device, exfiltrate data, or cause other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have some form of access to the device's management interface (typically via command-line interface).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the device's management interface.
*   **Access to CLI:** The attacker needs to be able to access the device's command-line interface.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability allows authenticated local users to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands via the device management CLI due to improper input sanitization. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Affected Versions:**

*   PAN-OS 4.0 versions up to and including 4.0.3
*   PAN-OS 3.1 versions up to and including 3.1.9
