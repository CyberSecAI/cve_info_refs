```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the `sdp_write_media_attributes` function when processing an SDP description for an RTSP stream of an H.264 video from a Matroska container. Specifically, the code attempts to access `fmt->oformat->priv_class` without verifying if `fmt->oformat` is a valid pointer which can lead to a crash if it is null.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Null pointer dereference due to a missing check for a null `fmt->oformat` pointer before accessing the `priv_class` member.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker could cause a denial-of-service condition by sending a crafted RTSP DESCRIBE request to the vulnerable `ffserver` instance, leading to a crash.
- Attack vectors: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RTSP DESCRIBE request to the vulnerable `ffserver` instance.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the `ffserver` service and send RTSP commands.
