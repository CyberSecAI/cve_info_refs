Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `download.lib.php` and `index.php` files within Pragyan CMS v3.0. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to a local file inclusion vulnerability through the `$_GET['fileget']` parameter.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input to the `fileget` parameter, allowing an attacker to include and display local files from the server's file system.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files (`config.inc.php`), system files (`/etc/passwd`, `boot.ini`), and other files containing sensitive information.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `fileget` parameter.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerable parameter is `$_GET['fileget']`

The exploit examples provided are:
```
http://localhost/Pragyan/?page=/&action=profile&fileget=../../../../../../../../../../../../  etc/passwd
http://localhost/Pragyan/?page=/&action=profile&fileget=../../../../../../../../../../../../appserv/www/Pragyan/cms/config.inc.php
http://localhost/Pragyan/?page=/&action=profile&fileget=../../../../../../../../../../../../home/exploitdb/public_html/Pragyan/cms/config.inc.php
```

These examples show that an attacker can use directory traversal sequences (`../`) to access files outside of the intended directory.
