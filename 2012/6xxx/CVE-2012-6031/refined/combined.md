How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```

Credit Matthew Daley.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Several sub-operations of the Transcendent Memory (TMEM) hypercall either do not correctly validate their inputs, do not correctly validate the privilege of the calling guest, or have other security-relevant bugs.  A full list of the vulnerabilities in the TMEM system is not available at present.  IMPACT ======  An unprivileged guest can overwrite hypervisor owned memory with the content of their choosing allowing them to escalate their privilege to that of the host.  In addition an unprivileged guest can also crash the hypervisor, leading to a Denial of Service attack.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  ONLY installations where "tmem" is specified on the hypervisor command line are vulnerable.  Most Xen installations do not do so.  All versions of Xen from 4.0 onward which have TMEM enabled and are running guests with untrusted administrators are vulnerable.  Although we consider it unlikely, we have not been able to rule out the possibility that an malicious unprivileged user could exploit these issues via a trusted TMEM-aware kernel.  Therefore all administrators are advised to disable TMEM even if all guest kernels are controlled and trusted.  MITIGATION ==========  Only systems which have TMEM enabled at boot time are affected by this issue.  By default TMEM is disabled unless it is explicitly enabled via the hypervisor command line option "tmem".  TMEM has been described by its maintainers as a technology preview, and is therefore not supported by them for use in production systems.  Pending a full security audit of the code, the Xen.org security team recommends that Xen users do not enable TMEM.  RESOLUTION ==========  Work is ongoing, by the community maintainers for TMEM, to patch the specific bugs as they are found.  This includes both the multiple vulnerabilities initially reported to the Xen.org security team, and multiple further vulnerabilities which have been discovered since then during our ad-hoc code inspection.  At the time of writing, a complete set of fixes even for known issues is not available.  PROCESS FOR TMEM VULNERABILITIES ================================  Until TMEM has gained production maturity, the Xen.org security team intends (subject of course to the permission of anyone disclosing to us) to handle these and future TMEM vulnerabilities in public, as if they were normal non-security-related bugs.  We therefore intend that currently-known vulnerabilities will be publicly disclosed on the xen-devel mailing list, as normal bug reports, at the expiry of the XSA-15 embargo.  In the meantime the list below may be helpful.  Xen.org security team will ensure, on expiry of the embargo, that the documentation reflects TMEM's technology preview status.  CREDIT ======  Thanks to Matthew Daley for finding these vulnerabilities (and that in XSA-12) and notifying the Xen.org security team.  LIST OF KNOWN VULNERABILITIES =============================  **NOTE** that this is unlikely to be a complete list of problems.  **NOTE** that after publication of this advisory, after the embargo ends, the advisory will no longer be updated to extend this list of vulnerabilities.  See `Process for TMEM vulnerabilities', above.   Multiple tmem save-related control ops do not check for NULL clients:        TMEMC_SAVE_GET_CLIENT_WEIGHT, TMEMC_SAVE_GET_CLIENT_CAP,       TMEMC_SAVE_GET_CLIENT_FLAGS and TMEMC_SAVE_END do not check       that the cli_id used to find the client is valid, and can       hence dereference a NULL client. This allows a malicious       guest to crash the host (DoS), or, in the case of       TMEMC_SAVE_END, memory corruption (DoS or worse).  Multiple tmem save-related control ops do not check guest output buffer pointers:        The functions tmemc_save_get_next_page,       tmemc_save_get_next_inv and the TMEMC_SAVE_GET_POOL_UUID       subop do not check incoming guest output buffer pointers,       and do not use ie. copy_to_guest. A malicious guest can       crash the host or cause memory corruption (DoS / code       execution).  Multiple tmem ops do not check for negative pool IDs:        The functions tmemc_save_get_next_page,       tmemc_restore_put_page and tmemc_restore_flush_page do not       check for negative pool IDs, allowing (at least) memory       corruption.  do_tmem_destroy_pool does not check for invalid pool IDs:        The function do_tmem_destroy_pool does not check for invalid       pool IDs, allowing a malicious guest to crash the host or       corrupt host memory (DoS / code execution).  do_tmem_control's privilege check is commented out:        This allows any guest access to control stack operations       (many of which themselves do not have adequate argument       checking).  tmh_copy_from_client and tmh_copy_to_client have an integer overflow vulnerability:        This can corrupt host memory.  do_tmem_get()'s bad_copy error path leaves a spinlock held:        The next operation on the same object will hang the CPU.       This is a host DoS.  do_tmem_op has at least one error path with broken locking checks:        This is a host DoS or worse.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJQRyVDAAoJEIP+FMlX6CvZZSEH/11RvLycH5Qm0rkmWb16iuRU s9xmGDxGr6LDGLLYenp7RDc6FU7xjFxNeMhziIWckic2f0V1UtEqxiTHViEeOsOu AQfiwrUaaSf+fwcDqt07bb6gTynxyqS+faLKpk4bq89tKK1318JlxWN2gRtEW5g9 KEo7Bt/O0hYuIJBlBWnH48OHPzGSrwVaw51NLt0oPqiWp4w3ObLRhVttKB7VWJlw OQR9hSStVWhKR68VUBd/LpTZTkX/Hn5qwhX6ltgQ10RW1n4cF2pvebiKu6CtePCl JVBJgn/4ZmaT1joJ8SpX/BONnLt0KHNrublB6vO++1m+7+lBA5qXL38gg4jl48E= =yP/R -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  ``` ``` _______________________________________________ Xen-announce mailing list Xen-announce@xxxxxxxxxxxxx <http://lists.xen.org/xen-announce> ```    ---      * Prev by Date:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 14 (CVE-2012-3496) - XENMEM\_populate\_physmap DoS vulnerability](msg00002.html)** * Next by Date:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 17 (CVE-2012-3515) - Qemu VT100 emulation vulnerability](msg00003.html)** * Previous by thread:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 14 (CVE-2012-3496) - XENMEM\_populate\_physmap DoS vulnerability](msg00002.html)** * Next by thread:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 17 (CVE-2012-3515) - Qemu VT100 emulation vulnerability](msg00003.html)** * Index(es):   + [**Date**](index.html#00006)   + [**Thread**](threads.html#00006) |

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 15 (CVE-2012-3497) - multiple TMEM
 hypercall vulnerabilities

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-3497 / XSA-15
                         version 2

              multiple TMEM hypercall vulnerabilities

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.  Credit Matthew Daley.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Several sub-operations of the Transcendent Memory (TMEM) hypercall
either do not correctly validate their inputs, do not correctly
validate the privilege of the calling guest, or have other
security-relevant bugs.

A full list of the vulnerabilities in the TMEM system is not available
at present.

IMPACT
======

An unprivileged guest can overwrite hypervisor owned memory with the
content of their choosing allowing them to escalate their privilege to
that of the host.

In addition an unprivileged guest can also crash the hypervisor,
leading to a Denial of Service attack.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

ONLY installations where "tmem" is specified on the hypervisor command
line are vulnerable.  Most Xen installations do not do so.

All versions of Xen from 4.0 onward which have TMEM enabled and are
running guests with untrusted administrators are vulnerable.

Although we consider it unlikely, we have not been able to rule out
the possibility that an malicious unprivileged user could exploit
these issues via a trusted TMEM-aware kernel.  Therefore all
administrators are advised to disable TMEM even if all guest kernels
are controlled and trusted.

MITIGATION
==========

Only systems which have TMEM enabled at boot time are affected by this
issue.  By default TMEM is disabled unless it is explicitly enabled
via the hypervisor command line option "tmem".

TMEM has been described by its maintainers as a technology preview,
and is therefore not supported by them for use in production systems.

Pending a full security audit of the code, the Xen.org security team
recommends that Xen users do not enable TMEM.

RESOLUTION
==========

Work is ongoing, by the community maintainers for TMEM, to patch the
specific bugs as they are found.  This includes both the multiple
vulnerabilities initially reported to the Xen.org security team, and
multiple further vulnerabilities which have been discovered since then
during our ad-hoc code inspection.

At the time of writing, a complete set of fixes even for known issues
is not available.

PROCESS FOR TMEM VULNERABILITIES
================================

Until TMEM has gained production maturity, the Xen.org security team
intends (subject of course to the permission of anyone disclosing to
us) to handle these and future TMEM vulnerabilities in public, as if
they were normal non-security-related bugs.

We therefore intend that currently-known vulnerabilities will be
publicly disclosed on the xen-devel mailing list, as normal bug
reports, at the expiry of the XSA-15 embargo.  In the meantime the
list below may be helpful.

Xen.org security team will ensure, on expiry of the embargo, that the
documentation reflects TMEM's technology preview status.

CREDIT
======

Thanks to Matthew Daley for finding these vulnerabilities (and that in
XSA-12) and notifying the Xen.org security team.

LIST OF KNOWN VULNERABILITIES
=============================

**NOTE** that this is unlikely to be a complete list of problems.

**NOTE** that after publication of this advisory, after the embargo
ends, the advisory will no longer be updated to extend this list of
vulnerabilities.  See `Process for TMEM vulnerabilities', above.

Multiple tmem save-related control ops do not check for NULL
clients:

      TMEMC_SAVE_GET_CLIENT_WEIGHT, TMEMC_SAVE_GET_CLIENT_CAP,
      TMEMC_SAVE_GET_CLIENT_FLAGS and TMEMC_SAVE_END do not check
      that the cli_id used to find the client is valid, and can
      hence dereference a NULL client. This allows a malicious
      guest to crash the host (DoS), or, in the case of
      TMEMC_SAVE_END, memory corruption (DoS or worse).

Multiple tmem save-related control ops do not check guest output
buffer pointers:

      The functions tmemc_save_get_next_page,
      tmemc_save_get_next_inv and the TMEMC_SAVE_GET_POOL_UUID
      subop do not check incoming guest output buffer pointers,
      and do not use ie. copy_to_guest. A malicious guest can
      crash the host or cause memory corruption (DoS / code
      execution).

Multiple tmem ops do not check for negative pool IDs:

      The functions tmemc_save_get_next_page,
      tmemc_restore_put_page and tmemc_restore_flush_page do not
      check for negative pool IDs, allowing (at least) memory
      corruption.

do_tmem_destroy_pool does not check for invalid pool IDs:

      The function do_tmem_destroy_pool does not check for invalid
      pool IDs, allowing a malicious guest to crash the host or
      corrupt host memory (DoS / code execution).

do_tmem_control's privilege check is commented out:

      This allows any guest access to control stack operations
      (many of which themselves do not have adequate argument
      checking).

tmh_copy_from_client and tmh_copy_to_client have an integer
overflow vulnerability:

      This can corrupt host memory.

do_tmem_get()'s bad_copy error path leaves a spinlock held:

      The next operation on the same object will hang the CPU.
      This is a host DoS.

do_tmem_op has at least one error path with broken locking checks:

      This is a host DoS or worse.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
