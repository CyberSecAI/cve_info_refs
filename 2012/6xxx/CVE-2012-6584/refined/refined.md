Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-6584:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The MYRE Realty Manager application has insufficient input validation in its `search.php` file. This leads to multiple vulnerabilities.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `bathrooms1` parameter in `search.php`. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries to access or modify database information.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS via several parameters in the `search.php` file (`bathrooms1`, `bathrooms2`, `bedrooms1`, `bedrooms2`, `cat_id1`, `city1`, `community1`, `country1`, `look`, `nolinks1`, `order`, `price1`, `price2`, `property_type1`, `sort`, `state1`, `zip1`). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement or other attacks.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection via the `bathrooms1` parameter in `search.php`. This allows an attacker to infer information about the database through time-based attacks (using `sleep()` function).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, view sensitive data, modify records or delete data.
    *   **XSS:**  An attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in the context of the victimâ€™s browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** An attacker could slowly retrieve data by observing the timing of responses, potentially extracting sensitive database information.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection & Blind SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `bathrooms1` parameter in the `search.php` URL.
    *   **XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL with an XSS payload in multiple parameters of the `search.php` file, and getting users to visit that URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `search.php` script. No special permissions are required, and the attack can be performed remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content also lists `CVE-2012-6585`, which is likely a related vulnerability within the same application but not directly related to this CVE.
* The Exploit-DB entry provides detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) URLs demonstrating the different vulnerability types.
* The report indicates that the application was tested on Windows 7 environment.
* This report is more detailed than the standard CVE description which is just a placeholder.
