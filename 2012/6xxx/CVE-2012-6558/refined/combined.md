### [PE Explorer Heap Overflow Vulnerability](http://waleedassar.blogspot.com/2012/05/pe-explorer-heap-overflow-vulnerability.html)

I have found a vulnerability in ***PE Explorer*** v***1.99 R6***. This heap overflow can be exploited to execute code arbitrarily. It is similar to the one of ***Resource Tuner*** shown in a [previous post](http://waleedassar.blogspot.com/2012/05/resource-tuner-heap-overflow.html).

The vulnerability occurs due to an insufficient check for the size of memory to be allocated. It can be triggered by manipulating the "***Size***" field of any ***RT\_STRING*** resource. Other resource types may also be subject to the same vulnerability.

If we change the "***Size***" field to a value like ***0x7FFFFFFF***, we can easily corrupt the heap.

Now let's have a quick look at this in ***Olly***.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibvs5q5AurL7A_9pO91hM3-ESaBG8sXe-SdBnfdk1CEeF0h6vYG8AZ2vY6ggmC8QukZCCwcJPIat5gJgo4udoV03ZOHDP5Op1D3tv0kEl5YPAUM2Jo5hUa8LpSA-CFFV1GuAkcZknpdnw/s400/vuln_overvw.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibvs5q5AurL7A_9pO91hM3-ESaBG8sXe-SdBnfdk1CEeF0h6vYG8AZ2vY6ggmC8QukZCCwcJPIat5gJgo4udoV03ZOHDP5Op1D3tv0kEl5YPAUM2Jo5hUa8LpSA-CFFV1GuAkcZknpdnw/s1600/vuln_overvw.jpg)

I will dissect this vulnerability into 5 parts for sake of clarification.

Step (1)

The value of the "***size***" field is fetched and stored locally at ***[ebp-48]*** . So, we now have ***0x7FFFFFFF*** at ***[ebp-48]***.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_uEBvXtLp3k7iqo2I5WRo4JtxNSgUao71lccXgkZps-RnCpjV8P_tvSbiP93gT2iFK-Jex2fds9zEvHjBFZr0PdVsz56ZWI5NZqbvpZGR2MnvV8VM2suOZcIzgODMg71Tarl8l5kFyAc/s400/vuln1.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_uEBvXtLp3k7iqo2I5WRo4JtxNSgUao71lccXgkZps-RnCpjV8P_tvSbiP93gT2iFK-Jex2fds9zEvHjBFZr0PdVsz56ZWI5NZqbvpZGR2MnvV8VM2suOZcIzgODMg71Tarl8l5kFyAc/s1600/vuln1.jpg)

Step (2)

The value of the "***size***" field is then passed to the function at ***0x571CD4*** (in disassembly in the image below, i named it as "***AdjustInteger***"). Upon return of the "***AdjustInteger***" function, we have ***0x80000000*** as the new size. The new size is stored locally at ***[ebp-44]***.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLMphU9n9OWJe8iqH4a67Ulu-F1ROEpqRXBbTdwzn-3X0g7CvCRi9VZEDHdtpHicR_s-lKMdNGMw9H52-ZjfSmmVFfJdFfiV8KQYKaIMougexXIRAKMxEe5J4DihmQCah6E7SoWcNMgiQ/s400/vuln2.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLMphU9n9OWJe8iqH4a67Ulu-F1ROEpqRXBbTdwzn-3X0g7CvCRi9VZEDHdtpHicR_s-lKMdNGMw9H52-ZjfSmmVFfJdFfiV8KQYKaIMougexXIRAKMxEe5J4DihmQCah6E7SoWcNMgiQ/s1600/vuln2.jpg)

Step (3)

The new size value (***0x80000000*** from step 2) is then incremented and passed to the function at ***0x4026A8*** (the one responsible for heap allocation). Th**is**function
converts its input value into an index. The index is then used to
extract a memory block of corresponding size. At the point of converting
the requested size into an index, the huge value is truncated into a
smaller value and a much smaller memory block than requested is
returned.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghkticwM7OfG-7YDCf_1mVHC1lxGDwpxbdGHThIJTK6EPW-m3hxFCRVoYBC1yZLvheypyehP-BCVAJv90ZKJqE78FT9lcH44AgW-iC2bZUUCsxIzfZq1mOhsLtZ0p6mkZ1Joj6z_K6xU8/s400/vvvv1.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghkticwM7OfG-7YDCf_1mVHC1lxGDwpxbdGHThIJTK6EPW-m3hxFCRVoYBC1yZLvheypyehP-BCVAJv90ZKJqE78FT9lcH44AgW-iC2bZUUCsxIzfZq1mOhsLtZ0p6mkZ1Joj6z_K6xU8/s1600/vvvv1.jpg)
Step (4)

The function at ***0x402B14*** ("***memset"*** equivalent) is then called with the huge value as its "***num***" parameter. Luckily, the function quickly returns if the "***num***" parameter is a signed value.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtBt-x82fQKOD47UVhf97bJgODRTZ-fPDkCg8coCRi3y61kjdFO3f58RkwlUKsV2fmFpYB2MENwIPFuQdA7zWRF4VqjkKLuK9b7qAGto6Mpul-vqX9STeLWULm9khN-cXGJI2wJOqiqAU/s400/vxvx1.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtBt-x82fQKOD47UVhf97bJgODRTZ-fPDkCg8coCRi3y61kjdFO3f58RkwlUKsV2fmFpYB2MENwIPFuQdA7zWRF4VqjkKLuK9b7qAGto6Mpul-vqX9STeLWULm9khN-cXGJI2wJOqiqAU/s1600/vxvx1.jpg)
 Step (5)

The function at ***0x4027E0*** ("***memcpy"*** equivalent) is called with the "***num***" parameter set to the huge integer stored at ***[ebp-48]*** (from step 1) causing heap corruption.

A Proof Of Concept can be found [here](http://ollytlscatch.googlecode.com/files/PEExplorer_HO.exe). Tested on XP SP3.

N.B. Increasing the size of the resource increases chances of corrupting the heap, something that can kill all functionalities of ***PE Explorer***.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
