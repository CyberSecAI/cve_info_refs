Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-6297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied configuration values in DD-WRT v24-sp2. Specifically, shell meta-characters within these configuration values are not properly escaped or filtered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core issue is that crafted configuration values containing shell meta-characters can be injected into system commands executed by the DD-WRT firmware. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the router with root privileges.
*   **System Compromise:** Complete control of the router, potentially allowing the attacker to alter its configuration, install malware, or use it as a pivot point into the network.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can inject commands that force the router into a reboot loop.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The attack is carried out via CSRF from an authenticated user. An attacker can trick an authenticated user's browser into sending malicious configuration changes to the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable DD-WRT router.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker relies on a currently logged-in user on the same network as the router to unintentionally execute their malicious request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported in the DD-WRT bug tracker on November 20, 2012, but it seems that the project was not actively maintained.
*   The vulnerability is similar to command injection issues found in other embedded systems like NETGEAR and Linksys routers.
