Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-6592

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a command injection vulnerability. An unauthenticated user can inject commands that are then executed as root on the affected device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78): The system fails to properly neutralize special elements used in OS commands, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary command execution: An attacker can execute any command on the system.
- Total compromise of the device: Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the device.
- High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact: This is due to the attacker's ability to potentially read sensitive data, modify system configurations, and cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is accessible over the network.
- Unauthenticated Access: The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the management interface of the vulnerable device.
- No Special Privileges: The attacker does not need any prior access or privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products/Versions:**
- PAN-OS 4.0 versions up to and including 4.0.4.
- PAN-OS 3.1 versions up to and including 3.1.9.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to PAN-OS 4.0.5 or later for 4.0 branch
- Upgrade to PAN-OS 3.1.10 or later for 3.1 branch
- Isolate the management interface and restrict access to authorized personnel.
