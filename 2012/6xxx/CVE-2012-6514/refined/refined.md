{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The nBill Lite Joomla component is vulnerable to HTML injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "HTML Injection",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code into the vulnerable component, which could lead to various malicious actions, such as defacing the website, redirecting users to malicious sites, or stealing user credentials through crafted forms. Although the blog post mentions that the vulnerability was only tested with admin access, one of the comments suggests that CSRF attacks might be possible if other parts of Joomla are vulnerable.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted URL parameter ('message') in the administrative interface of the 'nBill Lite' Joomla component.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator of the Joomla website to exploit the vulnerability directly. However, as noted in the comments, there might be ways to exploit this vulnerability with a non-admin account if combined with another vulnerability (e.g., CSRF). The blog author states the exploit was only tested from an admin account."
