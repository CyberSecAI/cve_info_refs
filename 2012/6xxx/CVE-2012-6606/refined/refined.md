Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-6606:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of certificate verification by the NetConnect and GlobalProtect App when connecting to the portal server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient verification of the server's certificate.
- The client application does not validate the identity of the server it is connecting to via certificate verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is possible.
- Attackers can intercept communication between the client and the legitimate server.
- Attackers can gain access to user credentials (username and password) by redirecting the client to a malicious server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Attacker intercepts network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned in a network path where they can intercept communication between the client (NetConnect or GlobalProtect App) and the intended portal server.
- The attacker needs to control a server and present a malicious certificate to the client.
- The attacker must be capable of performing a Man-in-the-middle attack.
- User interaction is required to initiate the connection to the malicious server.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects all versions of NetConnect and GlobalProtect App versions 1.1.6 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-310 which relates to the lack of cryptographic verification.
- A fix is available in GlobalProtect App 1.1.7 and later versions.
- NetConnect is discontinued, so no fix is available for it.
