Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-6687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of the `select` system call in `libfcgi` when handling multiple connections. `select` has a limitation on the number of file descriptors it can monitor (typically 1024). When an application using `libfcgi` attempts to handle more than 1024 concurrent connections, it leads to a stack-smashing issue. The `FD_SET` macro, used by select, does not perform range checks on file descriptors before use, causing an out-of-bounds write when file descriptors exceed 1024.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** Lack of proper range checks for file descriptors before using `FD_SET`.
- **Use of a Limited System Call:** Relying on `select`, which has a fixed limit on the number of file descriptors it can handle, leading to a denial of service when this limit is exceeded.
- **Stack Smashing:** The out-of-bounds write causes stack memory corruption due to an improper handling of file descriptors exceeding the limits of `select`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by opening a large number of socket connections to the host, leading to:
    - Segmentation fault (segfault)
    - Daemon crash
    - Infinite loop (possibly)

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a large number of connection requests to the affected service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish network connections to the vulnerable service. They don't need any special privileges. They just need to open more than 1024 connections to trigger the bug.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `os_unix.c` file of `libfcgi`.
- The fix involves replacing the `select` system call with `poll` in certain functions (specifically `Os_Close` and `is_af_unix_keeper`).  `poll` does not have the same limitation as `select`.
- Environment variables `LIBFCGI_OS_CLOSE_POLL_TIMEOUT` and `LIBFCGI_IS_AF_UNIX_KEEPER_POLL_TIMEOUT` were added to control poll timeouts in Os_Close and is_af_unix_keeper functions respectively.
- While the primary fix addresses `Os_Close` and `is_af_unix_keeper`, a comment in the Launchpad bug report #933417 mentions that `select` is also used in `OS_DoIo`, although this is not specifically addressed in the context of CVE-2012-6687.

The information from multiple sources indicates a consistent vulnerability related to using `select` system call in `libfcgi`. The resolution involves swapping it for `poll` system call.
