Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-6107:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of hostname verification in Apache Axis2/C when establishing SSL/TLS connections. Specifically, the software fails to verify if the server hostname matches the domain name present in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate provided by the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Hostname Verification:** The core vulnerability is the absence of proper hostname verification against the provided server certificate.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Risk:** This lack of verification allows a MITM attacker to present a valid, but incorrect certificate (i.e., not belonging to the intended server) to the client.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing:** Attackers can successfully impersonate legitimate SSL servers by using an arbitrary, valid certificate that doesn't match the actual server's hostname.
*   **Data Interception/Manipulation:** This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, or eavesdrop on sensitive information being transmitted between the client and the intended server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **MITM Attack:** The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle position between the client and server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the client and the server.
*   **Valid Certificate:**  The attacker needs a valid X.509 certificate, which may or may not be related to the target domain.
*   **Ability to Redirect Traffic:** The attacker must be able to redirect the client's connection to their malicious server.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects the axis2c package.
*   The fix was implemented in Axis2/C version 1.7.0.
*   The issue is tracked in Apache Jira under AXIS2C-1619.
*   A related Bugzilla entry (894372) was created for tracking purposes within Red Hat products.
