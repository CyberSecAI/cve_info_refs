An update that solves 13 vulnerabilities and has 35 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The kernel was updated to Linux kernel 3.0.80, fixing
various bugs and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed: CVE-2013-0160:
Timing side channel on attacks were possible on /dev/ptmx
that could allow local attackers to predict keypresses like
e.g. passwords. This has been fixed again by updating
accessed/modified time on the pty devices in resolution of
8 seconds, so that idle time detection can still work.
CVE-2013-3222: The vcc\_recvmsg function in
net/atm/common.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain length variable, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3223: The ax25\_recvmsg function in
net/ax25/af\_ax25.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain data structure, which allowed local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3224: The bt\_sock\_recvmsg function in
net/bluetooth/af\_bluetooth.c in the Linux kernel did not
properly initialize a certain length variable, which
allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel stack memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom
system call.
CVE-2013-3225: The rfcomm\_sock\_recvmsg function in
net/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize a certain length variable, which allowed local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3227: The caif\_seqpkt\_recvmsg function in
net/caif/caif\_socket.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize a certain length variable, which allowed local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3228: The irda\_recvmsg\_dgram function in
net/irda/af\_irda.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain length variable, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3229: The iucv\_sock\_recvmsg function in
net/iucv/af\_iucv.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain length variable, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3231: The llc\_ui\_recvmsg function in
net/llc/af\_llc.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain length variable, which allowed local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3232: The nr\_recvmsg function in
net/netrom/af\_netrom.c in the Linux kernel did not
initialize a certain data structure, which allowed local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3234: The rose\_recvmsg function in
net/rose/af\_rose.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a
certain data structure, which allowed local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3235: net/tipc/socket.c in the Linux kernel did
not initialize a certain data structure and a certain
length variable, which allowed local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a
crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.
CVE-2013-3076: The crypto API in the Linux kernel did
not initialize certain length variables, which allowed
local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel
stack memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call,
related to the hash\_recvmsg function in crypto/algif\_hash.c
and the skcipher\_recvmsg function in
crypto/algif\_skcipher.c.
CVE-2013-1979: The scm\_set\_cred function in
include/net/scm.h in the Linux kernel used incorrect uid
and gid values during credentials passing, which allowed
local users to gain privileges via a crafted application.
A kernel information leak via tkill/tgkill was fixed.

## Details

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's UDF

file system implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine

some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6548](/security/CVE-2012-6548))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's ISO

9660 CDROM file system driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to

examine some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6549](/security/CVE-2012-6549))

An integer overflow was discovered in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)

subsystem for the i915 video driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2013-0913](/security/CVE-2013-0913))

Andrew Honig discovered a flaw in guest OS time updates in the Linux

kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash host system) or

potential escalate privilege to the host kernel level. ([CVE-2013-1796](/security/CVE-2013-1796))

Andrew Honig discovered a use after free error in guest OS time updates in

the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest

user could exploit this flaw to escalate privilege to the host kernel

level. ([CVE-2013-1797](/security/CVE-2013-1797))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the way KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)

emulated the IOAPIC. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to

read host memory or cause a denial of service (crash the host).

([CVE-2013-1798](/security/CVE-2013-1798))

A format-string bug was discovered in the Linux kernel's ext3 filesystem

driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to possibly escalate

privileges on the system. ([CVE-2013-1848](/security/CVE-2013-1848))

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux Kernel's USB subsystem for

devices reporting the cdc-wdm class. A specially crafted USB device when

plugged-in could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-1860](/security/CVE-2013-1860))

A flaw was discovered in the SCTP (stream control transfer protocol)

network protocol's handling of duplicate cookies in the Linux kernel. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) on another remote user querying the SCTP connection.

([CVE-2013-2206](/security/CVE-2013-2206))

An information leak in the Linux kernel's dcb netlink interface was

discovered. A local user could obtain sensitive information by examining

kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-2634](/security/CVE-2013-2634))

A kernel stack information leak was discovered in the RTNETLINK component

of the Linux kernel. A local user could read sensitive information from the

kernel stack. ([CVE-2013-2635](/security/CVE-2013-2635))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-41-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -

  -
  [3.2.0-41.66](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-41.66)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Subject: CVE Requests (maybe): Linux kernel: various info leaks, some NULL ptr derefs

Hi Kurt,

I don't care much about info leaks beyond merely fixing them. But
Alexander asked me to request a CVE ID for the recent crypto fix of
mine and as I did quite a few of such fixes in the recent past, I'll
just list them all here. The information might be a bit scarce for a
CVE ID request but as I don't expect any CVE IDs anyway, I didn't
wanted to do too much unnecessary work. ;)

9a5467b crypto: user - fix info leaks in report API

This is quite a big info leak of heap, stack and .text memory. No
crypto material, though. Also, as the crypto user API is protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN), it's not as critical as is might sound on the
first sight. It affects all versions from the introduction of the
crypto user API -- that is v3.2 - v3.8.

Older info leak fixes follow. All of them ended up in v3.6 and were
backported to the stable/longterm kernels at the time:

ecd7918 xfrm_user: ensure user supplied esn replay window is valid
What: Leaks up to ~3.5kb heap memory. Was protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

1f86840 xfrm_user: fix info leak in copy_to_user_tmpl()
What: Minor leak of stack memory. Was protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

7b78983 xfrm_user: fix info leak in copy_to_user_policy()
What: Minor leak of heap memory. Was protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

f778a63 xfrm_user: fix info leak in copy_to_user_state()
What: Minor leak of heap memory. Was protected by
capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

4c87308 xfrm_user: fix info leak in copy_to_user_auth()
What: Leak of heap memory. Was protected by capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) at the time.

43da5f2 net: fix info leak in compat dev_ifconf()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

2d8a041 ipvs: fix info leak in getsockopt(IP_VS_SO_GET_TIMEOUT)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

7b07f8e dccp: fix info leak via getsockopt(DCCP_SOCKOPT_CCID_TX_INFO)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

3592aae llc: fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Major leak of stack memory (up to 128 bytes).

04d4fbc l2tp: fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

792039c Bluetooth: L2CAP - Fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

9344a97 Bluetooth: RFCOMM - Fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

f9432c5 Bluetooth: RFCOMM - Fix info leak in ioctl(RFCOMMGETDEVLIST)
What: Minor leak of heap memory.

9ad2de4 Bluetooth: RFCOMM - Fix info leak in getsockopt(BT_SECURITY)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

3f68ba0 Bluetooth: HCI - Fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

e15ca9a Bluetooth: HCI - Fix info leak in getsockopt(HCI_FILTER)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

3c0c5cf atm: fix info leak via getsockname()
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

e862f1a atm: fix info leak in getsockopt(SO_ATMPVC)
What: Minor leak of stack memory.

a117dac net/tun: fix ioctl() based info leaks
What: Leak of 36 bytes of stack memory.

0143fc5 udf: avoid info leak on export
What: Minor leak of heap memory.

fe685aa isofs: avoid info leak on export
What: Minor leak of heap memory.

Now do follow a few NULL ptr derefs ending up in privilege escalation
if a user is able to map page 0 or probably a DoS otherwise. Also
those have all been fixed in v3.6 and backported to the corresponding
stable/longterm kernels at the time:

864745d xfrm_user: return error pointer instead of NULL
What: Wrong return of NULL leads to wrong path in calling function
leading to NULL pointer deref of skb.

276bdb8 dccp: check ccid before dereferencing
What: Missing NULL pointer check leads to NULL function pointer.

That's all. Enough, I guess ;)

While we are at it: Do we care about getting CVE IDs for info leaks?
If so, all of them or only for the ones with leaks above a certain
threshold (>= 16 bytes, e.g.)?

Regards,
Mathias

* [linux-image-2.6.32-352-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-352.65](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-352.65)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

For type 1 the parent_offset member in struct isofs_fid gets copied
uninitialized to userland. Fix this by initializing it to 0.

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's UDF

file system implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine

some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6548](/security/CVE-2012-6548))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's ISO

9660 CDROM file system driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to

examine some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6549](/security/CVE-2012-6549))

An integer overflow was discovered in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)

subsystem for the i915 video driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2013-0913](/security/CVE-2013-0913))

Andrew Honig discovered a flaw in guest OS time updates in the Linux

kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash host system) or

potential escalate privilege to the host kernel level. ([CVE-2013-1796](/security/CVE-2013-1796))

Andrew Honig discovered a use after free error in guest OS time updates in

the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest

user could exploit this flaw to escalate privilege to the host kernel

level. ([CVE-2013-1797](/security/CVE-2013-1797))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the way KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)

emulated the IOAPIC. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to

read host memory or cause a denial of service (crash the host).

([CVE-2013-1798](/security/CVE-2013-1798))

A format-string bug was discovered in the Linux kernel's ext3 filesystem

driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to possibly escalate

privileges on the system. ([CVE-2013-1848](/security/CVE-2013-1848))

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux Kernel's USB subsystem for

devices reporting the cdc-wdm class. A specially crafted USB device when

plugged-in could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-1860](/security/CVE-2013-1860))

A flaw was discovered in the SCTP (stream control transfer protocol)

network protocol's handling of duplicate cookies in the Linux kernel. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) on another remote user querying the SCTP connection.

([CVE-2013-2206](/security/CVE-2013-2206))

An information leak in the Linux kernel's dcb netlink interface was

discovered. A local user could obtain sensitive information by examining

kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-2634](/security/CVE-2013-2634))

A kernel stack information leak was discovered in the RTNETLINK component

of the Linux kernel. A local user could read sensitive information from the

kernel stack. ([CVE-2013-2635](/security/CVE-2013-2635))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-28-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-28.48~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-28.48~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's UDF

file system implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine

some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6548](/security/CVE-2012-6548))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's ISO

9660 CDROM file system driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to

examine some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6549](/security/CVE-2012-6549))

An integer overflow was discovered in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)

subsystem for the i915 video driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2013-0913](/security/CVE-2013-0913))

Andrew Honig discovered a use after free error in guest OS time updates in

the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest

user could exploit this flaw to escalate privilege to the host kernel

level. ([CVE-2013-1797](/security/CVE-2013-1797))

A format-string bug was discovered in the Linux kernel's ext3 filesystem

driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to possibly escalate

privileges on the system. ([CVE-2013-1848](/security/CVE-2013-1848))

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux Kernel's USB subsystem for

devices reporting the cdc-wdm class. A specially crafted USB device when

plugged-in could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-1860](/security/CVE-2013-1860))

A flaw was discovered in the SCTP (stream control transfer protocol)

network protocol's handling of duplicate cookies in the Linux kernel. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) on another remote user querying the SCTP connection.

([CVE-2013-2206](/security/CVE-2013-2206))

An information leak in the Linux kernel's dcb netlink interface was

discovered. A local user could obtain sensitive information by examining

kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-2634](/security/CVE-2013-2634))

A kernel stack information leak was discovered in the RTNETLINK component

of the Linux kernel. A local user could read sensitive information from the

kernel stack. ([CVE-2013-2635](/security/CVE-2013-2635))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1430-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1430.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1430.39)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's UDF

file system implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine

some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6548](/security/CVE-2012-6548))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's ISO

9660 CDROM file system driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to

examine some of the kernel's heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6549](/security/CVE-2012-6549))

An integer overflow was discovered in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)

subsystem for the i915 video driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially

escalate privileges. ([CVE-2013-0913](/security/CVE-2013-0913))

Andrew Honig discovered a flaw in guest OS time updates in the Linux

kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash host system) or

potential escalate privilege to the host kernel level. ([CVE-2013-1796](/security/CVE-2013-1796))

Andrew Honig discovered a use after free error in guest OS time updates in

the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest

user could exploit this flaw to escalate privilege to the host kernel

level. ([CVE-2013-1797](/security/CVE-2013-1797))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the way KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)

emulated the IOAPIC. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to

read host memory or cause a denial of service (crash the host).

([CVE-2013-1798](/security/CVE-2013-1798))

A format-string bug was discovered in the Linux kernel's ext3 filesystem

driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to possibly escalate

privileges on the system. ([CVE-2013-1848](/security/CVE-2013-1848))

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux Kernel's USB subsystem for

devices reporting the cdc-wdm class. A specially crafted USB device when

plugged-in could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-1860](/security/CVE-2013-1860))

A flaw was discovered in the SCTP (stream control transfer protocol)

network protocol's handling of duplicate cookies in the Linux kernel. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) on another remote user querying the SCTP connection.

([CVE-2013-2206](/security/CVE-2013-2206))

An information leak in the Linux kernel's dcb netlink interface was

discovered. A local user could obtain sensitive information by examining

kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-2634](/security/CVE-2013-2634))

A kernel stack information leak was discovered in the RTNETLINK component

of the Linux kernel. A local user could read sensitive information from the

kernel stack. ([CVE-2013-2635](/security/CVE-2013-2635))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-28-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-28.48)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-28-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-28.48)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-28-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-28.48)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-28-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-28.48)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-28-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-28.48)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
