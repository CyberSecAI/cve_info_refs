- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the Java Number Format Exception Handling module. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input that's being processed as a number, resulting in a `NumberFormatException` when the input contains characters that cannot be parsed as a number, including malicious script code. This occurs within the exception handling process leading to the injection of the malicious code
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can inject malicious script code via the vulnerable parameter (e.g., `conversationContext`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the FortiDB appliance. Exploitation requires low to medium user interaction.
