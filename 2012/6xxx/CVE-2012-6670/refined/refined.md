The provided content relates to CVE-2012-6670.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within several DragonByte Tech add-ons for vBulletin, which allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The identified weaknesses are reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the following add-ons:
- vBActivity (Pro version): XSS vulnerability in Request and Nominate Award features.
- vBShout: XSS vulnerability in Shout Reports.
- Forumon: XSS vulnerability in Create New Monster functionality.
- vBDownloads: XSS vulnerability when displaying mirror URLs
- vBQuiz: XSS in profile block and URL path handling

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to:
- Account hijacking: If an attacker manages to steal cookies or session IDs.
- Defacement: Altering the appearance of the page or redirecting users to a malicious site.
- Information theft: Stealing sensitive information entered into the page by users.
- Performing actions on behalf of the user: Such as posting content or modifying settings.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are via user-controlled input fields within the respective add-ons. Malicious code can be injected through these fields when submitting:
- Award nominations and requests within vBActivity.
- Shout reports in vBShout.
- New monster creations in Forumon.
- Mirror URLs in vBDownloads
- Quiz names in vBQuiz

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable input fields, usually by being a logged-in user of the forum. The attacker would need to craft malicious input designed to execute JavaScript in the browser of the victim.
