How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hey all,

As a result of the audits performed due to the recent crop-up of XSS vulnerabilities, we've discovered a few more that we're now bringing you fixes for:

**vBActivity v3.0.1:**

**Fix:** (Pro) XSS vulnerability in Request and Nominate Award

**vBShout v6.0.6:**

**Fix:** XSS vulnerability in Shout Reports

**Forumon v1.0.8:**

**Fix:** XSS vulnerability in Create New Monster

For those who'd rather perform manual edits:

/dbtech/vbactivity/actions/nominatemedal.php

**Find**
PHP:

```
$reason = $vbulletin->input->clean_gpc('p', 'reason', TYPE_STR);
```

**Replace With**
PHP:

```
$reason = $vbulletin->input->clean_gpc('p', 'reason', TYPE_NOHTML);
```

/dbtech/vbactivity/actions/requestmedal.php

**Find**
PHP:

```
$reason = $vbulletin->input->clean_gpc('p', 'reason', TYPE_STR);
```

**Replace With**
PHP:

```
$reason = $vbulletin->input->clean_gpc('p', 'reason', TYPE_NOHTML);
```

/dbtech/vbshout/actions/doreport.php

**Find**
PHP:

```
$reportreason = $vbulletin->input->clean_gpc('p', 'reportreason', TYPE_STR);
```

**Replace With**
PHP:

```
$reportreason = $vbulletin->input->clean_gpc('p', 'reportreason', TYPE_NOHTML);
```

/dbtech/vbshout/actions/updatereport.php

**Find**
PHP:

```
$modnotes = $vbulletin->input->clean_gpc('p', 'modnotes', TYPE_STR);
```

**Replace With**
PHP:

```
$modnotes = $vbulletin->input->clean_gpc('p', 'modnotes', TYPE_NOHTML);
```

/dbtech/forumon/actions/main.php

**Find**
PHP:

```
    // Grab category id
    $vbulletin->input->clean_array_gpc('p', array(
        'monster'     => TYPE_ARRAY,
    ));
```

**Add Below**
PHP:

```
    $vbulletin->GPC['monster']['title']         = htmlspecialchars_uni($vbulletin->GPC['monster']['title']);
    $vbulletin->GPC['monster']['description']     = htmlspecialchars_uni($vbulletin->GPC['monster']['description']);
```

**Find**
PHP:

```
            // Grab a random hex colour
            $vbulletin->GPC['monster']['colors']["$foldername"] .= strtoupper(base_convert(mt_rand(0, 16), 10, 16));
        }
    }
```

**Add Below**
PHP:

```
    $vbulletin->GPC['monster']['title']         = htmlspecialchars_uni($vbulletin->GPC['monster']['title']);
    $vbulletin->GPC['monster']['description']     = htmlspecialchars_uni($vbulletin->GPC['monster']['description']);
```

In addition, in co-operation with BugAbuse.net, we've found additional vulnerabilities in two other mods; **vBDownloads** and **vBQuiz**.

Their latest release versions have been hotfixed. You can re-download the latest versions and re-upload the files to get the fixes.

If for whatever reason you are unable to download the latest versions, manual file edits are as follows:

/dbtech/downloads/actions/editdownload.php

**Find**
PHP:

```
$mirrorhtml .= '<input type="text" class="textbox" name="mirrors[]" style="margin-top: 4px;" value="' . $mirror . '" /><br />';
```

**Replace With**
PHP:

```
$mirrorhtml .= '<input type="text" class="textbox" name="mirrors[]" style="margin-top: 4px;" value="' . htmlspecialchars_uni($mirror) . '" /><br />';
```

/dbtech/vbquiz/hooks/process\_templates\_complete.php

**Find**
PHP:

```
?>
```

**Add Above**
PHP:

```
$vbulletin->options['dbtech_vbquiz_urlpath_text'] = ($vbulletin->options['dbtech_vbquiz_urlpath_text'] ? $vbulletin->options['dbtech_vbquiz_urlpath_text'] : $vbulletin->options['bburl'] . '/');
```

/dbtech/vbquiz/includes/class\_profileblock.php

**Find**
PHP:

```
$quiz_url = '[url="' . $quiz_link . '"]' . $data_data['quiz_name'] . '[/url]';
```

**Replace With**
PHP:

```
$quiz_url = '[url="' . $quiz_link . '"]' . htmlspecialchars_uni($data_data['quiz_name']) . '[/url]';
```

Finally, while it doesn't affect any of you, vulnerabilities were also discovered in our **vBeCommerce** system as well, also thanks to BugAbuse.

We suggest you either update or apply the file edits A.S.A.P., before these exploits leak to the wild.

Thank you for your continued support, and once again sorry for the inconvenience ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png "Frown    :(")
