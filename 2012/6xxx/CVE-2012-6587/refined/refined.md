Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2012-6587:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  The `/vacation/1_mobile/search.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via multiple parameters including `bathrooms1`, `bedrooms1`, `cata1`, `cat_id1`, `city1`, `country1`, `garage1`, `keywords1`, `look`, `nolinks1`, `order`, `page`, `pool1`, `price1`, `price2`, `sort`, `state1`, and `zip1`.
        *   The exploit also shows blind SQL injection at `/vacation/1_mobile/search.php` by using `bathrooms1=-1 or 77 = 75` and the request to `/vacation/widgate/request_more_information.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries to potentially access, modify, or delete database information, potentially leading to full database compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP scripts.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data before displaying it in the web page.
    *   **Weaknesses:** The script `/vacation/1_mobile/alert_members.php` is vulnerable to XSS via the `link_idd` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web page, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user such as stealing session cookies or redirecting to malicious websites.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP scripts.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send crafted HTTP requests with malicious JavaScript to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**
