Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in FreeNAC 3.02:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Weakness:** Multiple parameters in `stats.php` are vulnerable to reflective XSS.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted URLs with script code in parameters like `graphtype`, `type`, `comment`, `mac`, and `name`
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject client-side scripts into the web page viewed by the victim. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    *   **Attacker Position:** Remote attacker able to induce a user to visit a malicious link.

2.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Weakness:** The `comment` parameter in `deviceadd.php` is vulnerable to stored XSS
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Attacker injects malicious script into the comment field through a request to `deviceadd.php`, such as when updating or creating a new device record.
    *   **Impact:**  The injected script is stored in the database and executed when other users view the device record, leading to persistent compromise.
    *   **Attacker Position:**  An attacker can modify device records through the web interface.

3.  **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   **Weakness:** The `status` parameter in `deviceadd.php` is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Attacker crafts a malicious request to `deviceadd.php` that includes SQL injection payloads within the `status` parameter, such as the `SLEEP()` function to observe time-based delays.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database or potentially modify data. The blind nature means the attacker will not see the query results directly but can infer information from the server response times, or by using boolean-based techniques.
    *   **Attacker Position:** A remote attacker able to send crafted requests to `deviceadd.php`

**Root Cause:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in web pages (XSS) or using it in SQL queries (SQL Injection).
*   **Insecure Database Interaction:** The application constructs SQL queries by directly concatenating user-provided data, instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
