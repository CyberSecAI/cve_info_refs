The provided content is related to CVE-2012-6512.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Organizer plugin for WordPress contains multiple vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Full Path Disclosure (FPD).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the `delete_id` parameter in the `users.php` page.
2.  **Persistent XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "File extensions allowed" field on the `users.php` page, which is then stored and executed on subsequent visits to the page.
3.  **Full Path Disclosure (FPD):** The plugin reveals the full server path in various plugin files such as `plugin_hook.php`, `index.php`, `dir.php`, `options.php`, `resize.php`, `upload.php`, `users.php`, and `view.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirecting the user to a malicious site, among other things.
2. **FPD:** Disclosure of the full server paths can aid an attacker in understanding the system's file structure and can be used to exploit other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Reflected XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload in the `delete_id` parameter, and tricking a victim into visiting it.
2. **Persistent XSS:** By sending a POST request to the `users.php` page with malicious code in the "File extensions allowed" field.
3. **FPD:** By directly accessing the vulnerable files listed, an attacker can see the full server paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. For **Reflected XSS**, the attacker needs to trick a user (usually an administrator) into clicking a malicious link.
2. For **Persistent XSS**, the attacker needs to have the ability to send a POST request to the vulnerable page (typically requiring administrative access or some form of authentication to interact with admin pages).
3. For **FPD**, the attacker simply needs to access the vulnerable files via a web browser. No authentication is required.

The article notes that the developer will not fix these issues, so users should patch them manually.
The vulnerable versions are Organizer 1.2.1 and earlier.
