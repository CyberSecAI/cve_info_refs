The provided content is related to CVE-2012-6586.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in the application, specifically in the `/vacation/1_mobile/search.php` and `/vacation/widgate/request_more_information.php` scripts.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is also vulnerable to XSS via the `/vacation/1_mobile/alert_members.php` script.
- Blind SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL Injection: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing, or other malicious activities.
- Blind SQL injection can allow an attacker to infer sensitive data from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities are exploited by crafting malicious SQL queries in the URL parameters of `search.php` and `request_more_information.php`.
- XSS vulnerability is exploited via crafted URL parameter in `alert_members.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required for exploitation.
