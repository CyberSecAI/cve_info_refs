| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=965190#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-20 16:27:16 UTC  ``` An integer overflow flaw was found in the way DCP ETSI dissector of Wireshark, a network traffic analyzer, processed certain DCP ETSI packet capture files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted DCP ETSI packet capture file that, when processed, would lead to tshark executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running tshark binary.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0341)

## Topic

Updated wireshark packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer. It is used to capture and browse
the traffic running on a computer network.

Multiple flaws were found in Wireshark. If Wireshark read a malformed
packet off a network or opened a malicious dump file, it could crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark.
(CVE-2013-3559, CVE-2013-4083, CVE-2014-2281, CVE-2014-2299)

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2012-5595, CVE-2012-5598, CVE-2012-5599,
CVE-2012-5600, CVE-2012-6056, CVE-2012-6060, CVE-2012-6061, CVE-2012-6062,
CVE-2013-3557, CVE-2013-4081, CVE-2013-4927, CVE-2013-4931, CVE-2013-4932,
CVE-2013-4933, CVE-2013-4934, CVE-2013-4935, CVE-2013-5721, CVE-2013-7112)

All Wireshark users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running instances
of Wireshark must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1074114#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-08 01:08:46 UTC  ``` It was reported that Wireshark's NFS dissector could crash.  It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.  This is reported to affect Wireshark versions 1.10.0 to 1.10.5 and 1.8.0 to 1.8.12.  It is fixed in 1.10.6 and 1.8.13.  <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9672>   External References:  <http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2014-01.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1074114#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-08 01:15:56 UTC  ```  Created wireshark tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1074118](show_bug.cgi?id=1074118 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-2281 CVE-2014-2282 CVE-2014-2283 CVE-2014-2299 wireshark: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1074114#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-31 16:38:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0342 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0342.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1074114#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-31 18:07:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0341 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0341.html>   ``` |  |

## wnpa-sec-2012-33 · Wireshark SCTP dissector infinite loop

## Summary

**Name:** Wireshark SCTP dissector infinite loop

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2012-33

**Date:** November 28, 2012

**Affected versions:** 1.8.0 to 1.8.3, 1.6.0 to 1.6.13

[Wireshark bug 7802](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7802)

[CVE-2012-6056](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-6056)

## Details

### Description

The SCTP dissector could go into an infinite loop.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources by
injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a
malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.8.4 or later.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=881809#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-29 15:49:12 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way SCTP dissector of Wireshark, a network traffic analyzer, performed dissection of certain SCTP packet capture files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted SCTP packet / packet capture that, when processed, would lead to excessive CPU consumption or into situation where tshark executable would enter an infinite loop, when trying to process the crafted packet / packet capture file.
