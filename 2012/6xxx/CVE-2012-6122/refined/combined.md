## [Chicken-announce] Chicken 4.8.0.5 released

---

| **From**: | Jim Ursetto |
| --- | --- |

| **Subject**: | [Chicken-announce] Chicken 4.8.0.5 released |
| **Date**: | Thu, 3 Oct 2013 21:11:24 -0500 |

```
Hi all,

Chicken 4.8.0.5 is now available for download:

 <http://code.call-cc.org/releases/4.8.0/chicken-4.8.0.5.tar.gz>

This release includes several important security and crash fixes,
after a recent bug-hunting spree by our core hackers.

=== What's new ===

4.8.0.5
- Security fixes
  - CVE-2013-4385: read-string! no longer reads beyond its buffer when
    length is #f.
  - poll() is also used on cygwin by enabling the fix for CVE-2012-6122
  - file-creation-mode now passes a valid value to umask when its argument
    is omitted.  (Also ensure it always returns the old umask value.)
  - Fix a data corruption problem in list->queue.

- Core libraries
  - read-string! behaves correctly in presence of EOF.
  - Several subtle problems in the reader in the presence of EOF are fixed.

- Runtime
  - Fix an issue on initial seed of the random number generator.

==================

The 4.8.0.x releases reside on the stability/4.8.0 branch in git,
which you can retrieve with:

git clone --branch stability/4.8.0 git://code.call-cc.org/chicken-core

Or browse my unofficial github mirror:
<https://github.com/ursetto/chicken-core-stability/tree/stability/4.8.0>

## [Chicken-hackers] [PATCH] \*portable\* fix for select() buffer overrun

---

| **From**: | Peter Bex |
| --- | --- |

| **Subject**: | [Chicken-hackers] [PATCH] \*portable\* fix for select() buffer overrun |
| **Date**: | Sun, 18 Nov 2012 21:09:51 +0100 |
| **User-agent**: | Mutt/1.4.2.3i |

```
Hello all,

Windows is a pain in the neck.  Here's a patch that uses poll() on
all systems except Windows.  This should work around the buffer overrun
vulnerability in select() described in
<http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-users/2012-06/msg00031.html>
I hope we can finally check this one off our list; it's been almost
half a year!

I've tested Spiffy on NetBSD with Slowloris, and I couldn't get it to
crash when HAVE_POSIX_POLL was defined, whereas it would crash quickly
when it wasn't (but only in a DEBUGBUILD; for some reason a normal build
won't crash so easily).

Cheers,
Peter

## [Chicken-users] [SECURITY] Buffer overrun vulnerability in Chicken's sch

```
Hello Chicken users,

Recently a buffer overrun error was discovered in Chicken's thread
scheduler.  This buffer overrun is triggered on UNIX-like OSes when a
file descriptor with an integer value higher than FD_SETSIZE gets
opened due to the way the POSIX select() function is currently being
used.

Every Chicken program which accepts a potentially unlimited number of
incoming network connections or otherwise opens an unlimited number of
file descriptors is potentially vulnerable to an application crash.

Currently a patch is being developed.  In the meanwhile an effective
workaround is to limit the maximum number of open descriptors using
the Unix "ulimit -n" command.

Please verify the maximum number of descriptors supported safely by
Chicken by compiling following one-line program using csc and then
running the resulting binary:

(print (foreign-value "FD_SETSIZE" int))

Simply ensure that the programs you want to protect run under a maximum
number of open files ulimit that matches this number (or lower).

lease note that this bug also affects people using the
"high-load-scheduler" egg, which provides an alternative scheduler
implementation.

On Windows, there is no buffer overrun danger, but there is a potential
problem of threads never waking up; there is currently no known
workaround for this.

email cve-assign@...re.org for all these things. I just assign CVE's,
Mitre handles the entries/write ups/database/etc.

Correction, this introduced a bug on systems where connect() can return
EINPROGRESS, resulting in an exception being raised when connecting to a
socket and immediately writing to it.  A third patch is required to fix
this bug:

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-02-02 22:10:14 UTC  ``` From $URL :  Recently a handful of security bugs have been found and fixed in the Chicken Scheme compiler (<http://www.call-cc.org>).  We (the core team) have decided we'd like to start using CVE identifiers for the benefit of our users and distributions.  I'd like to request CVEs for the currently known security bugs:  * POSIX select() buffer overrun, fixed on in Chicken 4.8.2 (development snapshot) by switching to POSIX poll() on platforms where supported. This is also fixed in 4.8.0.1 (stability release).  Original announcement, with workaround (followed by preliminary patch): <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-users/2012-06/msg00031.html> Final patch: <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-hackers/2012-11/msg00075.html>  * Poisoned NUL byte injection due to incomplete protection by missing checks in some procedures, fixed in Chicken 4.8.0: <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-users/2012-09/msg00004.html>  * Broken randomization procedure on 64-bit platforms (it returned a constant value).  This function wasn't used for security purposes (and is advertised as being unsuitable), so I'm unsure a CVE is needed: <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-hackers/2012-02/msg00084.html> Fixed in 4.8.0.  * Vulnerability to algorithmic complexity attacks due to hash table collisions.  Fixed in 4.8.0. First public confirmation of the issue, with preliminary (broken) patch: <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-hackers/2012-01/msg00002.html> Proper fix: <http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-hackers/2012-01/msg00020.html> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  erik falor    2013-02-03 00:02:40 UTC  ``` I have pushed an ebuild for dev-scheme/chicken-4.8.0.1 into the lisp overlay. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Panagiotis Christopoulos (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-02-05 23:52:25 UTC  ``` --- ChangeLog   2013-01-18 00:22:13.000000000 +0200 +++ ChangeLog.new       2013-02-06 01:50:34.000000000 +0200 @@ -2,6 +2,15 @@  # Copyright 1999-2013 Gentoo Foundation; Distributed under the GPL v2  # $Header: /var/cvsroot/gentoo-x86/dev-scheme/chicken/ChangeLog,v 1.45 2013/01/17 22:22:13 pchrist Exp $   +*chicken-4.8.0.1 (05 Feb 2013) + +  05 Feb 2013; Panagiotis Christopoulos <pchrist@gentoo.org> +  -chicken-4.8.0.ebuild, +chicken-4.8.0.1.ebuild, +  +files/chicken-4.8.0.1-parallel-build.patch, +  -files/chicken-4.8.0-parallel-build.patch: +  Bump chicken to 4.8.0.1, fixes security issues addressed in [bug #455200](show_bug.cgi?id=455200 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-scheme/chicken-4.8.0.3: multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-{6122,6123,6124,6125})"), +  thanks to proxy-maintainer Erik Falor (fadein) ewfalor at gmail dot com +  *chicken-4.8.0 (17 Jan 2013) ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sean Amoss (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-02-24 16:45:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=455200#c2))  Thanks, Panagiotis.

Subject: CVE request: CHICKEN Scheme incomplete fix for CVE-2012-6122 (select() fs_set buffer overrun)

Hi all,

I'd like to request a CVE for a select() fd_set buffer overrun problem
in CHICKEN Scheme before 4.8.2 and all stable versions up to and
including 4.8.0.3, on non-Windows systems.

The bug exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-6122.  Originally,
only the userland thread scheduler's use of select() was rewritten to
use POSIX poll().  It was later discovered by Florian Zumbiehl and Joerg
Wittenberger that select() was still being used in three other places.

This bug is remotelye xploitable in networking code, under the right
conditions (if the "ulimit -n" value exceeds FD_SETSIZE).

The announcement can be found at
<http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2013-05/msg00000.html>

There are two commits which together fix the bug:
<http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=chicken-core.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e2022652258e8a30e5cedbf0abc9cd85a0f6af7>
<http://code.call-cc.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=chicken-core.git;a=commitdiff;h=556108092774086b6c86c2e27daf3f740ffec091>

Cheers,
Peter Bex

Hi,
multiple security issues have been found in chicken. Please see here for more
information: <http://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=136030422026406&w=2>

These are fixed in sid, but if simple, isolated backports of the changes
can be identified, we could still fix this up before the Wheezy release
or in a later point update.

Cheers,
        Moritz

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
