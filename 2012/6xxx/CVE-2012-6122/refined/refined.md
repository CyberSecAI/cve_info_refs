  "cve": "CVE-2012-6122",
  "description": "Buffer overflow in the thread scheduler in Chicken before 4.8.0.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by opening a file descriptor with a large integer value.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the thread scheduler when handling file descriptors. Specifically, the use of `select()` in the scheduler with a file descriptor that has a large integer value results in a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper use of select()"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can cause a denial of service (crash) of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a file descriptor with a large integer value, potentially through network connections or other means of file descriptor creation.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to cause the application to open a file descriptor with an integer value exceeding the buffer size limit. This could involve network connections (accepting many connections) or through other means of file descriptor manipulation."

    "Chicken versions before 4.8.0.1"
