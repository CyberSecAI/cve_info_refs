Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6684:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input by the RedCloth library when converting Textile markup to HTML. Specifically, the library fails to filter out or escape the `javascript:` URI scheme when used in link definitions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The RedCloth library does not prevent the injection of malicious JavaScript code through specially crafted input. This is due to the library interpreting `javascript:` in a URI context and then rendering it into the `href` attribute of a HTML anchor tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through user-controlled input processed by RedCloth. An attacker could inject the malicious payload via:
    *   Comments
    *   Forum posts
    *   Any other user-generated content where RedCloth is used to render the content to HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to input text that will be processed by RedCloth and rendered in the context of a vulnerable application's users. This requires the attacker to have some way of injecting the malicious payload, for instance by submitting content through web forms.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported in Feb 2012 but was not fixed for a long time, which is why the advisory emphasizes the 9-year timeframe in the title.
*   The vulnerability exists in RedCloth versions from 3.0.1 up to 4.2.9 (and potentially intermediate versions in the 4.x series).
*   The issue is triggered even when HTML filtering options are enabled in RedCloth (e.g., `:filter_html, :filter_styles, :filter_classes, :filter_ids`).
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) was provided using the following RedCloth syntax: `["clickme":javascript:alert(%27XSS%27)]`. This input will generate HTML with `<a href="javascript:alert(...">` which triggers the XSS.
*   A fix was made in the Debian package by limiting the acceptable URI schemes to http, https, mailto, and relative URIs.
*   The original developer of RedCloth has stepped down from active maintainership and has stated he is unable to fix the issue.
