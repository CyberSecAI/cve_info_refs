## TL;DR

You shouldn't use RedCloth to parse user inputted contents and output the parsed string (except that you allow your user to write arbitrary JavaScript code on your site) because it contains unfixed XSS vulnerability for 9 years, and it be also disclosed for 2 years.

Unfortunately, we may not expect fix the vulnerability by the current developer because he announced that ["unable to keep fixing bugs or work on the next major release"](https://github.com/jgarber/redcloth#redcloth-needs-new-maintainers).

If you want to continue to use RedCloth for such contents, you should patch for the problem yourself, consider contributing to RedCloth, or otherwise.

## What is RedCloth

I recognize RedCloth is a well-known converting Textile library for Ruby.

You can see some information and get the library from <http://redcloth.org/> or <https://rubygems.org/gems/RedCloth>

## The Issue

I reported the PoC to a developer of RedCloth in Feb. 24, 2012: <https://gist.github.com/co3k/75b3cb416c342aa1414c>

For your convenience, I paste (and some modified) a PoC to the following:

```
require 'redcloth'

print RedCloth.new('["clickme":javascript:alert(%27XSS%27)]', [:filter_html, :filter_styles, :filter_classes, :filter_ids]).to_html

# Result:
# <p><a href="javascript:alert(%27XSS%27)">clickme</a></p>

```

You can see the above generated a element has the href attribute value which contains javascript scheme. It causes execute arbitrary JavaScript code by clicking the rendered link.

## Timeline

* Feb. 24, 2012 : I reported the problem to a developer (by sending e-mail)
* Feb. 29, 2012 : A developer discloses the issue in this ticket: <http://jgarber.lighthouseapp.com/projects/13054-redcloth/tickets/243-xss>
* ...
* Sep. 24, 2014 : Announced "RedCloth needs new maintainers" to take over RedCloth by a developer: <https://github.com/jgarber/redcloth/commit/b24f03db023d1653d60dd33b28e09317cd77c6a0>
* Dec. 8, 2014 : I reported a site contains XSS issue caused by this RedCloth vulnerability
* Dec. 9, 2014 : I decided to disclose this problem on my site
* Dec. 11, 2014 : Published.

## Affected Version

I've confirmed the following versions of RedCloth are affected:

* RedCloth 4.2.9 (November 27, 2011) [latest version]
* RedCloth 4.2.0 (June 10, 2009)
* RedCloth 4.1.9 (February 20, 2009)
* RedCloth 3.0.4 (September 15, 2005)
* RedCloth 3.0.3 (February 6, 2005)
* RedCloth 3.0.2 (February 3, 2005)
* RedCloth 3.0.1 (January 18, 2005)

I've confirmed that RedCloth 3.0.0 generates link without javascript scheme. So the version of 3.0.0 is not affected.

I couldn't test with RedCloth 4.0.0 to RedCloth 4.1.1 on my environment.

## Workaround

Some projects use their own RedCloth and avoid a type of this problem. I know the Redmine's case.

Redmine uses old RedCloth 3.0.4 but it is very patched: <http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository/changes/trunk/lib/redcloth3.rb> and the XSS issue is fixed in <http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository/revisions/2212> . The Redmine's fix looks good to me; limited types of schemes should be accepted so it might help to create your own patch.

Of course using an alternative library or well-maintained fork of RedCloth 4, or filtering user inputted values, or some monkey patching approach might be effective. But I'm sorry too that I can't indicate specific information since I'm not Ruby-aware programmer.

I disclosed the following advisory about a XSS vulnerability of
RedCloth (Textile library for Ruby).
<http://co3k.org/blog/redcloth-unfixed-xss-en>

You shouldn't use RedCloth to parse user inputted contents and output
the parsed string (except that you allow your
user to write arbitrary JavaScript code on your site) because it
contains unfixed XSS vulnerability for 9 years,
and it be also disclosed for 2 years.

Unfortunately, we may not expect fix the vulnerability by the current
developer because he announced that "unable to
keep fixing bugs or work on the next major release".

If you want to continue to use RedCloth for such contents, you should
patch for the problem yourself, consider
contributing to RedCloth, or otherwise.

Package        : ruby-redcloth
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-6684
Debian Bug     : 774748

Kousuke Ebihara discovered that redcloth, a Ruby module used to
convert Textile markup to HTML, did not properly sanitize its
input. This allowed a remote attacker to perform a cross-site
scripting attack by injecting arbitrary JavaScript code into the
generated HTML.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.9-2+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.9-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-redcloth packages.
