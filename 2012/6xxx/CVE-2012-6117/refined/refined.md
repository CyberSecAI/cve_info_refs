The provided content relates to CVE-2012-5509, not CVE-2012-6117. The bug report describes a vulnerability in `aeolus-configserver-setup`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `aeolus-configserver-setup` script creates a temporary file in `/tmp` containing key/secret credentials and does not properly remove it after use.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure temporary file handling: The script creates a temporary file with sensitive information (credentials) in a world-readable location (`/tmp`).
- Insufficient cleanup: The script fails to delete the temporary file after its purpose is fulfilled.
- Inadequate file permissions: The file is created with `chmod 755`, making it readable to all users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive credentials: An attacker could gain access to the credentials if they can access the `/tmp` directory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: Any user on the system could potentially read the temporary file containing the credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system where `aeolus-configserver-setup` is executed.
- No other special capabilities are required, just the ability to browse the `/tmp` directory.
