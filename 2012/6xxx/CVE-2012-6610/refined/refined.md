Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Polycom web management interface allows users to perform network troubleshooting tests by sending ICMP echo requests to user-supplied hosts.
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation on the user-supplied data used as a parameter in the `ping` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **OS Command Injection:**  The web interface uses user-provided input directly in a `ping` command without sanitization. An attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands by using the semicolon (`;`) to chain commands. The output redirection can be bypassed using the `#` comment symbol to comment out the rest of the command string.
*   **Default Weak Credentials:** The default administrative password for the Polycom web management interface was empty.
*    **Privilege Escalation:** The embedded web server (lighttpd) runs with superuser privileges, causing injected commands to be executed as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Polycom operating system with root privileges.
*  **System Configuration Modification:** An attacker could modify system configuration files. For example, they could modify the `inetd.conf` file to enable the telnet daemon, allowing for further remote access.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  The ability to execute arbitrary commands as root can lead to a complete compromise of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the web management interface.
*   Specifically, the "Diagnostics --> Network --> PING" section of the web interface is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the Polycom device's web management interface.
*   No prior authentication is needed due to the empty default administrator password, or valid credentials if the default was changed.
*  The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted input to the ping functionality.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Polycom HDX Video End Points running software versions earlier than 3.0.4 and UC APL customers running software versions earlier than 2.7.1.J.
*   The advisory also mentions a related vulnerability, "Path Traversal on Polycom Web Management Interface," which can be used to view the output of injected commands. This allows attackers to avoid blind command injection.
