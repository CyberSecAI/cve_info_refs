* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 2015 roll up patch 1, which fixes
multiple security issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that
provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources

database.

This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Data
Virtualization 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in
the README file included with the patch files.

The following security issues are also fixed with this release,

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-12 08:21:09 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153) was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches  the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074#c1)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-12 09:16:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1165533>  This issue affects the versions of HttpComponents Client as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6 and Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6; and ModeShape Client as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6. However, this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported scenario in Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6 and JBoss Data Virtualization 6. A future update may address this issue.  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4,  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4, and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 are now in Phase 3, Extended Life Support, of their respective life cycles. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat JBoss Middleware and Red Hat JBoss Operations Network Product Update and Support Policy: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes/>  Fuse ESB 4, Fuse Message Broker 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and Fuse Services Framework 2.3, 2.4 are now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

Use of comma used as part of the subject attribute value could confuse tokenizer to split subject and attempt to match "CN=" string in the middle of some other attribute value.

# USN-2769-1: Apache Commons HttpClient vulnerabilities

14 October 2015

Several security issues were fixed in commons-httpclient.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [commons-httpclient](/security/cves?package=commons-httpclient) - A Java(TM) library for creating HTTP clients

## Details

It was discovered that Apache Commons HttpClient did not properly verify the

Common Name or subjectAltName fields of X.509 certificates. An attacker could

exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive

information or alter encrypted communications. This issue only affected Ubuntu

12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-5783](/security/CVE-2012-5783))

Florian Weimer discovered the fix for [CVE-2012-5783](/security/CVE-2012-5783) was incomplete for Apache

Commons HttpClient. An attacker could exploit this to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive information or alter

encrypted communications. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

([CVE-2012-6153](/security/CVE-2012-6153))

Subodh Iyengar and Will Shackleton discovered the fix for [CVE-2012-5783](/security/CVE-2012-5783) was

incomplete for Apache Commons HttpClient. An attacker could exploit this to

perform a machine-in-the-middle attack to view sensitive information or alter

encrypted communications. ([CVE-2014-3577](/security/CVE-2014-3577))

It was discovered that Apache Commons HttpClient did not properly handle read

timeouts during HTTPS handshakes. A remote attacker could trigger this flaw to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5262](/security/CVE-2015-5262))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.04

* [libcommons-httpclient-java](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/commons-httpclient)
  -
  [3.1-10.2ubuntu0.15.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/commons-httpclient/3.1-10.2ubuntu0.15.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libcommons-httpclient-java](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/commons-httpclient)
  -
  [3.1-10.2ubuntu0.14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/commons-httpclient/3.1-10.2ubuntu0.14.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libcommons-httpclient-java](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/commons-httpclient)
  -
  [3.1-10ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/commons-httpclient/3.1-10ubuntu0.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-12 08:21:09 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153) was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches  the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074#c1)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-12 09:16:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1165533>  This issue affects the versions of HttpComponents Client as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6 and Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6; and ModeShape Client as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6. However, this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported scenario in Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6 and JBoss Data Virtualization 6. A future update may address this issue.  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4,  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4, and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 are now in Phase 3, Extended Life Support, of their respective life cycles. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat JBoss Middleware and Red Hat JBoss Operations Network Product Update and Support Policy: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes/>  Fuse ESB 4, Fuse Message Broker 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and Fuse Services Framework 2.3, 2.4 are now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c0)  Gordon Watson    2014-11-05 22:16:07 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  We have seen two customer cases where a live storage migration has essentially completed, but the associated job table entry in the RHEV database is not marked as "FINISHED", e.g.     action_type   |                     description                     | status  |         start_time         | end_time  -----------------+-----------------------------------------------------+---------+----------------------------+----------  LiveMigrateDisk | Migrating Disk lsm-vm_Disk1 from LSM_GFW to NFS_GFW | STARTED | 2014-11-04 17:34:20.213-05 |    In the Admin Portal the Tasks pane shows that the storage migration is still in progress.  The engine sequence below completes;  CloneImageGroupStructureVDSCommand VmReplicateDiskStartVDSCommand SyncImageGroupDataVDSCommand VmReplicateDiskFinishVDSCommand DeleteImageGroupVDSCommand  On the SPM host, these have completed successfully.   Looking at the Storage Domain, the disk images only exist in the destination domain.  However what is missing from the engine sequence is the following;  2014-10-22 17:55:26,184 INFO  [org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.lsm.LiveMigrateDiskCommand] (org.ovirt.thread.pool-4-thread-46) [295a737f] Ending command successfully: org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.lsm.LiveMigrateDiskCommand 2014-10-22 17:55:26,184 INFO  [org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.lsm.LiveMigrateDiskCommand] (org.ovirt.thread.pool-4-thread-46) [295a737f] Lock freed to object EngineLock [exclusiveLocks= , sharedLocks= key: 6e0cbf5c-b52c-488d-b1dd-a0565dd31ba7 value: VM 2014-10-22 17:55:27,717 INFO  [org.ovirt.engine.core.dal.dbbroker.auditloghandling.AuditLogDirector] (org.ovirt.thread.pool-4-thread-46) [295a737f] Correlation ID: 295a737f, Job ID: c55f0eb3-3b37-48a9-b3af-6a3c4740ae4e, Call Stack: null, Custom Event ID: -1, Message: User admin finished moving disk VM_Disk1 to domain SD-A.    I have been able to recreate this several times by live migrating 20 (arbitrary number) disks at once.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  My test environment;     - RHEV-M 3.4.3     - Single host with (essentially) vdsm-4.14.13-2  Customer environments;        - RHEV-M 3.3.4    - Hosts with vdsm-4.14.11-5     - RHEV-M-3.4.2    - 2 hosts - vdsm-4.13.2-0.13    - 1 host  - vdsm-4.14.11-5 (SPM)   How reproducible:  If I try to live migrate 20 disks at once I have encountered this problem every time.    Steps to Reproduce:  1. In my specific case I created a pool of 20 VMs based off a template in an NFS data domain.  2. I then started all 20 VMs.  3. I then copied the template to a second NFS domain. 4. I then live migrated all 20 disks to the second NFS domain.   Actual results:  One of the 20 failed as described above. Another failed in a different way, which will be described in a separate bug. The disk for this one remained "locked" and the LSM sequence did not complete on the engine side. It never executed VmReplicateDiskFinishVDSCommand.   Expected results:  All of the LSMs should complete and the associated jobs in the database be marked as "FINISHED".   Additional info:  Supporting data will be added shortly.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c7)  Daniel Erez    2014-11-09 13:09:55 UTC  ``` Hi Gordon,  Can you please attach the log of the failed migration - as mentioned in bug description: "Another failed in a different way, which will be described in a separate bug. The disk for this one remained "locked" and the LSM sequence did not complete on the engine side."   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c11)  Ravi Nori    2014-11-11 18:48:23 UTC  ``` Hi Gordon,  Have you tried reproducing this on master/3.5?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c13)  Allon Mureinik    2014-11-17 16:45:45 UTC  ``` Ravi, Daniel - how are we proceeding here?   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c14)  Daniel Erez    2014-11-18 14:44:39 UTC  ``` Should be fixed in 3.5 build.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c15)  lkuchlan    2014-11-23 14:23:03 UTC  ``` Eyal, can you please add the version it is fixed in? Thanks   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c16)  Allon Mureinik    2014-11-23 18:51:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to lkuchlan from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c15)) > Eyal, can you please add the version it is fixed in? > Thanks  RHEV 3.5 vt8 should have this fix.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c17)  lkuchlan    2014-12-01 11:11:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 963240](attachment.cgi?id=963240 "image") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=963240&action=edit "image") image  Tested using RHEM 3.5 vt11 All of the LSMs completed successfully and the associated jobs in the database be marked as "FINISHED"   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1160889#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-02-11 18:10:07 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take
effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c0)  David Jorm    2014-08-14 00:58:41 UTC  ``` It was found that the fix for [CVE-2012-5783](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5783) was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c1)  David Jorm    2014-08-14 01:13:55 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c2)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-14 07:42:17 UTC  ``` Upstream Commit:  HttpClient/4.2.x Branch <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1411705>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c4)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-14 07:53:41 UTC  ``` Affects:  org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient <= 4.2.2 commons-httpclient:commons-httpclient <= 3.1   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c5)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-14 08:29:44 UTC  ``` Statement:  Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1165533>  This issue affects the versions of HttpComponents Client and ModeShape Client as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.

This issue did not affect the jakarta-commons-httpclient packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7, and httpcomponents-client packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4,  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4, and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 are now in Phase 3, Extended Life Support, of their respective life cycles. This issue has been rated as having Important security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

Both [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153) and [CVE-2012-5783](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5783) are considered to be resolved by a version of httpclient fixing [CVE-2014-3577](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3577).   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c18)  Martin Prpič    2014-08-20 08:13:54 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was found that the fix for [CVE-2012-5783](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5783) was incomplete: the code added to check that the server host name matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed.

That fix added support for checking of the connection host name against X.509 certificate host name, which was not performed before at all.  The check was implemented using the code that used string representation of the subject field, splitting it on commas, and checking each part to see if it contains "CN=" substring.  The fix applied upstream in version 4.2.3 that got [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153) assigned changed the code to only extract host name if subject attribute started with "CN=".  The fix prevented attacks using "CN=" string used as part of other subject attributes, such as organization ("O") or organizational unit ("OU").  I.e. it prevented certificate with the following subject to be accepted as valid for host "bank.com":    OU=CN=bank.com,CN=evil.com  Even this improved fix was found to be incomplete, see [CVE-2014-3577](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3577) ([bug 1129074](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3577 Apache HttpComponents client / Apache CXF: SSL hostname verification bypass, incomplete CVE-2012-6153 fix")).   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2014-08-25 13:40:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to errata-xmlrpc from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c19)) > This issue has been addressed in following products: >  >   Red Hat Software Collections 1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 >   Red Hat Software Collections 1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 EUS >  > Via RHSA-2014:1082 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1082.html>  This erratum updated the thermostat1-httpcomponents-client package.

The code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c1)  David Jorm    2014-08-14 01:13:55 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c2)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-14 07:42:17 UTC  ``` Upstream Commit:  HttpClient/4.2.x Branch <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1411705>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c4)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-14 07:53:41 UTC  ``` Affects:  org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient <= 4.2.2 commons-httpclient:commons-httpclient <= 3.1   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c5)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2014-08-14 08:29:44 UTC  ``` Statement:  Additional information can be found in the Red Hat Knowledgebase article: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1165533>  This issue affects the versions of HttpComponents Client and ModeShape Client as shipped with Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6. However, this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported scenario in Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6. A future update may address this issue.  This issue did not affect the jakarta-commons-httpclient packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7, and httpcomponents-client packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.  Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4,  Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4, and Red Hat JBoss Web Server 1 are now in Phase 3, Extended Life Support, of their respective life cycles.

Both [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153) and [CVE-2012-5783](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5783) are considered to be resolved by a version of httpclient fixing [CVE-2014-3577](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3577).   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c18)  Martin Prpič    2014-08-20 08:13:54 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was found that the fix for [CVE-2012-5783](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5783) was incomplete: the code added to check that the server host name matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-08-20 10:41:59 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Software Collections 1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Software Collections 1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 EUS  Via RHSA-2014:1082 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1082.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2014-08-25 13:13:58 UTC  ``` The original issue [CVE-2012-5783](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5783) was tracked via [bug 873317](show_bug.cgi?id=873317 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-5783 jakarta-commons-httpclient: missing connection hostname check against X.509 certificate name").  That fix added support for checking of the connection host name against X.509 certificate host name, which was not performed before at all.  The check was implemented using the code that used string representation of the subject field, splitting it on commas, and checking each part to see if it contains "CN=" substring.  The fix applied upstream in version 4.2.3 that got [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153) assigned changed the code to only extract host name if subject attribute started with "CN=".  The fix prevented attacks using "CN=" string used as part of other subject attributes, such as organization ("O") or organizational unit ("OU").  I.e. it prevented certificate with the following subject to be accepted as valid for host "bank.com":    OU=CN=bank.com,CN=evil.com  Even this improved fix was found to be incomplete, see [CVE-2014-3577](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3577) ([bug 1129074](show_bug.cgi?id=1129074 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3577 Apache HttpComponents client / Apache CXF: SSL hostname verification bypass, incomplete CVE-2012-6153 fix")).   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2014-08-25 13:40:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to errata-xmlrpc from [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=1129916#c19)) > This issue has been addressed in following products: >  >   Red Hat Software Collections 1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 >   Red Hat Software Collections 1 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 EUS >  > Via RHSA-2014:1082 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1082.html>  This erratum updated the thermostat1-httpcomponents-client package.

## Topic

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.5.0 is now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

The Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several
interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and
interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a
Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface
(API).

It was discovered that the HttpClient incorrectly extracted the host name
from an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)

A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaw was found in the oVirt REST API.
A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted web page that, when
visited by a user with a valid REST API session, would allow the attacker
to trigger calls to the oVirt REST API. (CVE-2014-0151)

It was found that the oVirt web admin interface did not include the
HttpOnly flag when setting session IDs with the Set-Cookie header.
This flaw could make it is easier for a remote attacker to hijack an oVirt
web admin session by leveraging a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
(CVE-2014-0154)

The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat
Product Security.

These updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager packages also
include numerous bug fixes and various enhancements. Space precludes

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0, which fixes multiple security
issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that
provides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources
to multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data
spread across physically distinct systems—such as multiple databases, XML
files, and even Hadoop systems—appear as a set of tables in a local
database.

The release of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0 serves as a
replacement for Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0. It includes
various bug fixes, which are listed in the README file included with the

## Topic

Updated packages for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 that fix
two security issues are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5,
and 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Platform is a platform for Java applications,
which integrates the JBoss Web Server with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam.

It was discovered that the HttpClient incorrectly extracted host name from
an X.509 certificate subject's Common Name (CN) field. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially
crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)

The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat
Product Security.

For additional information on these flaws, refer to the Knowledgebase
article in the References section.

All users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages. The JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied. Also, back up your existing Red
Hat JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5 installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BRMS is a business rules management system for the

A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153, CVE-2014-3577)

The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1129634#c0)  Prasad Mukhedkar    2014-08-13 11:59:37 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Unable to export a virtual machine (with prealloacted disk ) from iscsi storage domain to NFS Export. When  "export" action is initiated it fails with below error event :  ---- Cannot export VM. Disk configuration (COW Preallocated) is incompatible with the storage domain type. ----  and below errors in engine.log :  2014-08-13 07:26:41,973 INFO  [org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.ExportVmCommand] (ajp-/127.0.0.1:8702-7) [7a3ce0a] Lock Acquired to object EngineLock [exclusiveLocks= key: 68c90755-3ae2-48cd-92b7-836e9eebabca value: VM [-]  2014-08-13 07:26:42,169 WARN  [org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.ExportVmCommand] (ajp-/127.0.0.1:8702-7) [7a3ce0a] CanDoAction of action ExportVm failed.

RHEV-M + ISCSI storage domain 2. Create a virtual machine with pre-alloacted allocation policy. 3. Try to export the vm to export storage domain.  Actual results:   Expected results: Export fails with error :  Cannot export VM. Disk configuration (COW Preallocated) is incompatible with the storage domain type.  Additional info:  VM should get exported irrespective whether it has thin or think disk.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1129634#c2)  Prasad Mukhedkar    2014-08-14 16:00:51 UTC  ``` I believe this bug somehow related to it. [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1116486](show_bug.cgi?id=1116486 "CLOSED ERRATA - When importing a VM in RHEVM 3.4 all its disks turn from thin provision to preallocated")   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1129634#c3)  Tal Nisan    2014-08-20 11:27:24 UTC  ``` Ok, managed to find exact steps to reproduce:  Create a VM with a thinly provision disk on an NFS domain Export the VM to an export domain Import the VM, in the disk allocation choose a block domain Disk will be imported as Cow-Preallocated and export will not be possible for it.  The bug causing it was fixed in [BZ 1111655](show_bug.cgi?id=1111655 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Disks imported from Export Domain to Data Domain are converted to Preallocated after upgrade from oVirt 3.4.1 to 3.4.2") so this should not happen in this process anymore, we are working on a fix for the already existing Cow-Preallocated disks   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1129634#c5)  Elad    2014-08-26 06:51:14 UTC  ``` Since there is no such disk combination as COW preallocated in the system, and the only way to achieve it would be by reproducing this  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1130753](show_bug.cgi?id=1130753), I'm not sure how can we try to reproduce it. I tried to test it by reproducing [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1130753](show_bug.cgi?id=1130753). I got a COW preallocated disk by importing a sparse disk to a block domain. The disk did turn to COW preallocated. My plan was to leave this disk in the system and to upgrade RHEVM to the latest build where the bug should be fixed and see that exporting a COW preallocated disk will work. The problem is that after the upgrade, the COW preallocated disk turned to sparse.  Tal, do you have any idea how to get a COW preallocated disk in the system so we will be able to test this?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1129634#c6)  Tal Nisan    2014-08-26 08:50:16 UTC  ``` Since the bug fix it shouldn't happen so basically the fact that it doesn't happen means that the bug was indeed fixed   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1129634#c7)  Elad    2014-08-26 09:10:02 UTC  ``` After a discussion with Tal, I'm moving the bug to VERIFIED because the fix here is that the COW preallocated disk,  created because of [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1130753](show_bug.cgi?id=1130753) is converted to sparse after the upgrade to the build where the bug is fixed.  Verified by reproducing [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1130753](show_bug.cgi?id=1130753), upgrading from ovirt-3.5 RC1 to RC2. Checked that the disk was converted to sparse and exported it the the export domain. The export succeeded.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1129634#c8)  Elad    2014-08-26 09:15:06 UTC  ``` CORRECTION: Verified by reproducing [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1130753](show_bug.cgi?id=1130753), upgrading from ovirt-3.5 RC1 to RC1.1. Checked that the disk was converted to sparse and exported it the the export domain. The export succeeded.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1129634#c9)  Allon Mureinik    2014-11-26 20:57:38 UTC  ``` Tal, can you please provide the doctext?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1129634#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-02-11 18:07:46 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules and processes management system

This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss BPM
Suite 6.0.3, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. It includes various
bug fixes, which are listed in the README file included with the
patch files.

The following security issues are fixed with this release:

## Synopsis

Important: thermostat1-httpcomponents-client security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1082)

## Topic

Updated thermostat1-httpcomponents-client packages that fix one security
issue are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

[Updated 25 August 2014]
This erratum previously incorrectly listed the CVE-2012-6153 issue as
addressed by this update. However, that issue did not affect the
thermostat1-httpcomponents-client packages.

## Description

Thermostat is a monitoring and instrumentation tool for the OpenJDK HotSpot
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with support for monitoring multiple
JVM instances.

The httpcomponents-client package provides an HTTP agent implementation
that is used by Thermostat to visualize collected data in an HTTP-aware
client application.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added
to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's
Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed.
A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server
using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

For additional information on this flaw, refer to the Knowledgebase
article in the References section.

All thermostat1-httpcomponents-client users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Issue

In late 2012, a [research paper](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.utexas.edu%2F%7Eshmat%2Fshmat_ccs12.pdf) was published, showing that several commonly used libraries that handled SSL connections failed to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's CN or subjectAltName field of the x.509 certificate. Apache HttpClient was one of these libraries, and the issue in HttpClient was identified by [CVE-2012-5783](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5783). There are two main version streams of HttpClient currently in use: Apache Commons HttpClient 3.x (also known as Apache Jakarta Commons HttpClient) and Apache HttpComponents HttpClient 4.x.

While reviewing the patch in November 2012, engineers from Red Hat Product Security noticed that the fix for [CVE-2012-5783](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5783) was incomplete. The code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This can be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject. A patch for this issue was [committed upstream](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fsvn.apache.org%2Fviewvc%3Fview%3Drevision%26revision%3D1411705), and incorporated into HttpClient 4.2.3. At the time, it was unclear that this issue was feasibly exploitable, so no CVE ID was assigned. It has now become apparent that it is exploitable, and this issue has been assigned [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153).

It has now been reported that the patch for [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153) was still incomplete, and that a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where the attacker can spoof a valid certificate using a different specially crafted subject is still possible. This issue has been assigned [CVE-2014-3577](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3577)

## Resolution

Some Red Hat products include versions of HttpClient that are patched for [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153), but still vulnerable to [CVE-2014-3577](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3577). Other Red Hat products include versions of HttpClient that are still vulnerable to the original [CVE-2012-6153](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-6153) issue. Red Hat is currently working on patches for all affected products as a high priority. The patches will ensure both issues are resolved.

# RHSA-2015:1888 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 which fixes multiple
security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process
automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage
existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and
CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process
execution speed and quality.

It was found that the code which checked that the server hostname matches
the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates
was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an
SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2012-6153,
CVE-2014-3577)

It was found that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML
content, representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass
XML to XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks,
including remote code execution in the context of the server running the
XStream application. (CVE-2013-7285)

It was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had
insufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.
A remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using
Xalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the
secure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the
classpath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the
context of the application server running the application that uses
Xalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)

It was found that the org.jboss.seam.web.AuthenticationFilter class
implementation did not properly use Seam logging. A remote attacker could
send specially crafted authentication headers to an application, which
could result in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
running that application. (CVE-2014-0248)

It was found that the implementation of the
org.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory() method
provided a DocumentBuilderFactory that would expand entity references.
A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files
accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially
perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3530)

It was discovered that the implementation used by the Not Yet Commons SSL
project to check that the server host name matches the domain name in the
subject's CN field was flawed. This could be exploited by a
man-in-the-middle attacker by spoofing a valid certificate using a
specially crafted subject. (CVE-2014-3604)

Red Hat would like to thank Alexander Papadakis for reporting
CVE-2014-3530. The CVE-2012-6153 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of
Red Hat Product Security, the CVE-2014-3604 issue was discovered by Arun
Babu Neelicattu of Red Hat Product Security, and the CVE-2014-0248 issue
was discovered by Marek Schmidt of Red Hat.

All users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this security update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform installation (including its databases,
applications, configuration files, and so on).

Note that it is recommended to halt the Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform server
by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing this
update, and then after installing the update, restart the Red Hat JBoss SOA
Platform server by starting the JBoss Application Server process.
