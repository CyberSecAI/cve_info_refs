{
    "CVE-2012-6544": {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel's Bluetooth L2CAP implementation fails to initialize the l2_bdaddr_type member of struct sockaddr_l2 and the padding byte, leading to information leaks.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "Information leak"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can examine portions of the kernel's stack memory.",
        "Attack vectors": "A local user can use the getsockname() system call on an L2CAP socket.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the system."
    }
