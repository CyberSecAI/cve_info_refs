### Bug Description

/usr/sbin/guest-account has this cleanup:

# remove leftovers in /tmp

  find /tmp -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -uid "$UID" | xargs rm -rf || true

This runs with the cwd of the last logged in user. If the user creates a file "/tmp/x a", the file "a" gets removed from the last user's login.

Thanks to Ryan Lortie for discovering this!

CC'ing Yves-Alexis Perez as he is the Debian maintainer. It only affects testing/unstable (if Debian ships the guest account script at all), so it doesn't need a DSA.

Debian doesn't seem to ship the guest account script in their lightdm package, so this is likely Ubuntu-specific.

Please wait until I publish updates to the stable release before commiting this.

Thanks!

debdiff for oneiric's gdm-guest-session. Should apply well to older versions as well. I also fixed the cleanup in /var/cache/gdm/, although that's not an exploitable vulnerability.
