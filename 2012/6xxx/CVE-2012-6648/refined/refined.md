Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0943:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `guest-session-cleanup.sh` script in `gdm-guest-session` removes temporary files created by guest sessions. The script used `find` and `xargs` to locate and delete files based on user ID. However, it failed to properly handle filenames with spaces, leading to incorrect file deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper input sanitization:** The script used `xargs rm -rf` with space as a separator which led to arbitrary file deletion
- **Command injection**: Specifically, the vulnerability exists within the `find /tmp -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -uid "$UID" | xargs rm -rf` command due to spaces being used as the separator.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A local attacker could create files with spaces in their names within the `/tmp` directory. Upon guest session cleanup, the script would incorrectly interpret the file paths due to spaces as a separator in `xargs` and delete files from the previous logged in user.
- **Potential Data Loss/System Instability**: This could lead to loss of data and potentially system instability if critical files were deleted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local access**: An attacker must be able to log in to the system and create files in `/tmp` with spaces in their names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User access**: The attacker needs to have a user account on the system (not necessarily with administrative privileges).
- **Ability to create files:** The attacker must be able to create files in `/tmp` directory, which is typically a standard user capability.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in `gdm-guest-session` versions prior to the fix and also in the `lightdm` package due to the inclusion of the vulnerable script within the packaging.
- The fix was to use `-print0` option with `find` and `-0` option with `xargs` which properly handle filenames containing spaces
- The vulnerability is specific to how the guest session cleanup script was implemented in Ubuntu and was not present in Debian's lightdm package.
