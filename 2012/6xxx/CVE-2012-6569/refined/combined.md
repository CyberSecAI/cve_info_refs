# Security Advisory-Buffer Overflow on Stack in HTTP Module

* SA No:Huawei-SA-20120808-02-HTTP-Module
* Initial Release Date:
  Aug 04, 2012
* Last Release Date:
  Aug 14, 2012

Summary

Branch Intelligent Management System (BIMS) and Web management is provided by Huawei for network and device management.

Both BIMS and Web management use HTTP. Therefore, to use BIMS and Web management, you must enable HTTP. Attackers can make stack overflow by sending messages with the URI whose length is more than the declared length. Attackers can remotely execute arbitrary commands (Vulnerability ID: HWNSIRT-2012-0804).

This vulnerability was first reported by Felix Lindner of Recurity Labs GmbH.

Currently, workarounds are available and are detailed below.

Affected Products

1. Affected Products：

* AR router：The AR18/28/46 and AR19/29/49 are multi-service routers for small and medium-sized enterprises. The AR18/28/46 supports Branch Intelligent Management System (BIMS), which is provided by Huawei for network and device management. The AR18-2X, AR18-3X, and AR18-3XE also support Web management. The AR19/29/49 supports Web management only.

Affected versions:

AR 19/29/49 R2207 earlier versions

AR 28/46 R0311 and earlier versions

AR 18-3x R0118 and earlier versions

AR 18-2x R1712 and earlier versions

AR18-1x R0130 and earlier versions

* Huawei Swithes：S2000 series, S3000 series, S3500 series, S3900 series, S5100 series and S5600 series switches support WEB management, and enable HTTP service. S7800 series switches with R6305 version or later version support WEB management, and enable HTTP service. The S8500 series switches don’t support Web management, but HTTP server is enabled by default in the earlier versions.

Affected versions:

S2000 series, S3000 series, S3500 series, S3900 series, S5100 series and S5600 series switches

S7800 series switches with R6305 version or later version

S8500 series switches with the version R1631

S8500 series switches with the version R1632

2. Not affected products:

* AR router：AR router is multi-service routers for small and medium-sized enterprises.

Not Affected versions:

AR G3 (AR 200/1200/2200/3200)

AR19/29/49 R2207 and later versions

* Huawei Swithes：The Huawei Series switches feature a multi-service routing and switching platform to meet requirements for service bearing at the access, aggregation, and core layers of an network.

Not Affected versions:

S6500 series switches

S7800 series switches with R6105 version

S8500 series swithes with version earlier R1631

S8500 series swithes with version later R1632

S2300&3300&5300&6300&9300 series switches

S2700&3700&5700&6700&7700&9700 series switches

Impact

By exploiting the vulnerability, attackers can execute injected arbitrary codes, such as elevating privileges, creating root account and so on.

Vulnerability Scoring Details

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSSv2 scoring system

(http://www.first.org/cvss/).

Too-long URI would result in stack overflow:

Base Score: 9.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Temporal Score: 8.4 (E:H/RL:T/RC:C)

Technique Details

All the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. The HTTP management interface is in the "Up" state. (By default, this interface is enabled).

2. The IP address of the management interface is reachable.

3. Attackers have rights to use the HTTP management interface, or be able to hijack the HTTP session by exploiting the SESSION-ID-Too-Short vulnerability (more details in Huawei-SA-20120804-01-HTTP-Module).

Vulnerabilities details

Once URI length of HTTP messages are greater than specific max length, when it is copied into buffer, a stack overflow will occur, Attackers can insert their shellcode into URI, and remotely execute it on device. Through the vulnerability, attacker can control whole device.

Temporary Fix

Scenario 1: When vulnerable devices are used, neither Web management nor Branch Intelligent Management System (BIMS) is used for remote configuration.

Workarounds: Connect using SSH and shut down the HTTP port and disable BIMS service. The detailed configuration is as follows:

AR 18/28/46:

[Quidway] ip http shutdown

[Quidway] undo bims enable

AR 19/29/49:

[Quidway] undo ip http enable

S2000 series, S3000 series, S3500 series, S3900 series, S5100 series and S5600 series switches:

[Quidway] ip http shutdown  (If this command is not supported by one specified  switch with one specified version, it indicates the security vulnerability described here does not exist in this switch with this version, and no workaround is necessary to be implemented)

S7800 series switches:

[Quidway] undo ip http enable

Scenario 2: Web management or BIMS is used for remote vulnerable device configuration.

Workarounds: Connect using SSH and set ACL rules to restrict source IP addresses for HTTP establishment. The detailed configuration is as follows:

AR 18/28/46:

[Quidway] acl number 2001

[Quidway-acl-basic-2001] rule 0 permit source 1.1.1.1 0

[Quidway-acl-basic-2001]rule 5 deny

[Quidway]ip http acl 2001

AR 19/29/49:

[Quidway] acl number 2001

[Quidway-acl-basic-2001] rule 0 permit source 1.1.1.1 0

[Quidway-acl-basic-2001]rule 5 deny

[Quidway]ip http acl 2001

S2000 series, S3000 series, S3500 series, S3900 series, S5100 series and S5600 series switches:

[Quidway] acl number 2001

[Quidway-acl-basic-2001] rule 0 permit source 1.1.1.1 0

[Quidway-acl-basic-2001]rule 5 deny

[Quidway]ip http acl 2001  (If this command is not supported by one specified  switch with one specified version, it indicates the security vulnerability described here does not exist in this switch with this version, and no workaround is necessary to be implemented)

S7800 series switches

[Quidway] acl number 2001

[Quidway-acl-basic-2001] rule 0 permit source 1.1.1.1 0

[Quidway-acl-basic-2001]rule 5 deny

[Quidway]ip http acl 2001

Scenario 3:Web management is not supported, but HTTP service port is open.

Workarounds: Shut down the HTTP port. The detailed configuration is as follows:

S8500 series switches:

[Quidway] ip http shutdown

FAQs

Question 1: Can someone else exploit these vulnerabilities remotely through networks to perform the read-write operation on the board files?

Answer: These vulnerabilities can only be exploited through the local area network to make the read-write operation on the board files possible. The remote users cannot access the Web Server of board, so they cannot exploit these vulnerabilities remotely through networks.

Question 2: How can I identify the software version of the E585 I am using?

Answer: Locally access the address of the board gateway (the default address is 192.168.1.1) to log in to the Web UI. And check the software version under the menu of Advanced settings->System->Version.
