{
  "cve": "CVE-2012-6079",
  "description": "W3 Total Cache before 0.9.2.5 exposes sensitive cached database information which allows remote attackers to download this information via their hash keys.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The W3 Total Cache plugin generates predictable hash keys for cached database information, and the cache files are stored in a publicly accessible directory without proper access controls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable cache filenames.",
      "Exposed database cache files.",
      "Lack of access control on cache directory."
    ],
    "impact": "Sensitive database information, including password hashes, can be downloaded by remote attackers.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote attackers can access the exposed cache files via their predictable hash keys.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to know or be able to guess the hash key based on the algorithm used by W3 Total Cache, and also be able to access the publicly available directory.",
     "additional_info": "The plugin was generating htaccess files but failing to protect the cache. The database prefix, user id, site id and host are guessable or publicly known."
  }
