## Optimize Website Performance with Powerful Caching Techniques

W3 Total Cache empowers your website with a comprehensive suite of caching options to accelerate page load times, reduce server load, and deliver an exceptional user experience. By leveraging various caching techniques, you can unlock the full potential of your WordPress site. Let’s explore the different types of caching offered by W3 Total Cache:

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### **Page Caching**

When enabled visitors experience lightning-fast page load times, resulting in improved user engagement.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### **Database Caching**

By storing frequently accessed database results in memory, subsequent requests for the same data can be served more efficiently.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### **Fragment Caching**

By caching only the necessary dynamic elements, you strike a balance between dynamic content and improved performance.

![W3 Total Cache box](data:image/svg+xml...)

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### **Object Caching**

By caching objects, you can enhance the performance of complex plugins and themes, resulting in a smoother and more efficient user experience.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### **REST API Caching**

By caching the API responses, subsequent requests for the same data can be served from the cache, minimizing the load on your server.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### **Browser Caching**

By caching assets locally, subsequent site visits have reduced download times as the browser fetches static files from the cache.

## Take Control Over Your Google PageSpeed and GTmetrix Scores

**There’s more to faster websites than just caching.**

Boosting your website’s speed goes beyond server caching alone. Our WordPress Caching plugin, W3 Total Cache, also includes a range of powerful features:

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### Lazy Loading Images

Lazy loading defers the images and google maps from loading until they become visible in the viewport. This allows pages to be ready for the user quickly, providing the best possible experience.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### HTTP Compression

Whether Brotli, Gzip, Deflate, etc., any compression standard is supported to reduce the file sizes as much as possible to improve end-user experience.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### WebP Image Conversion

Take advantage of the latest image compression technology without doing anything differently. WebP images are smaller than other formats delivering the best possible experience for visitors.

![](data:image/svg+xml...)

### Minifying

Making HTML, RSS, CSS, JavaScript, and Image Attachments as small as possible means the fastest loading time for your website visitors.

## Accelerate Even Faster with W3 Total Cache and a CDN

A *Content Delivery Network* **(CDN)** is a global network of servers that delivers that delivers web content from the nearest server, reducing latency and speeding up your site for users worldwide.

**Asset Caching**

Improve your website’s load time by caching assets such as images and JavaScript files. W3 Total Cache integrates with CDNs to distribute these resources strategically, optimizing content delivery for faster user experiences.

Available in our **Free** version.

**Pro**

Take caching at the CDN even further with our Full Site Delivery feature. This advanced functionality caches entire HTML pages at the edge of the network, ensuring your visitors experience unparalleled speed and reliability.

Only available in **W3TC Pro.** [Upgrade now](#pricing), follow our [Full Site Delivery setup guide](/support/w3-total-cache/full-site-delivery/), and go faster today!

## WebP Image Conversions

**Free**

* 10 conversions *per hour*
* 100 conversions *per month*

**Pro**

* 10,000 conversions *per hour*
* Unlimited conversions *per month*

![webP Logo](data:image/svg+xml...)

[Pro version](#pricing)     **WebP Image Conversions** have higher limits on W3 Total Cache Pro.

## Delay Scripts

Boost performance by delaying selected JavaScript files

**Social Media Widgets**

JavaScript files for social media widgets, such as buttons and share icons, can be delayed to ensure the main content loads first.

**Non-Essential Plugins**

Certain plugins may load JavaScript files for features that are not immediately necessary, such as chat widgets or pop-ups.

**Analytics Scripts**

Delaying scripts related to analytics services like Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel can prioritize content loading before tracking user data.

**Custom Scripts**

Any custom JavaScript code on your website that isn’t essential for the initial user interaction can also be delayed.

[Pro version](#pricing)     **Delay Scripts** is only available with W3 Total Cache Pro.

## Preload Requests

**Prefetch DNS Requests**

DNS prefetching is a technique that resolves domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses before the user clicks a link, speeding up the process of loading a page.

**Preconnecting**

Preconnecting establishes a connection to a server before a resource is needed, reducing latency when the resource is actually requested.

**Preload Cache**

Preloading instructs the browser to fetch and cache a resource (like an image or script) in the background, so it’s readily available when needed.

[Pro version](#pricing)     **Preload Requests** is only available with W3 Total Cache Pro.

## Remove Unused CSS/JS

Not every CSS and JS file need to load on every page

**What is this feature and why do I need it?**

This functionality allows you to trim down unnecessary CSS and JS files from loading on every page. By selectively loading only what’s needed, you can significantly reduce page load times.

**Example Use Case**

Let’s say your website theme includes a CSS file responsible for animations that are only used on specific pages. This file, named animation.css, contains styles for animations that enhance the visual appeal of certain elements on your site.

However, these animations are utilized only on a few pages, such as the homepage and a particular product page. Using W3 Total Cache Pro’s Remove CSS/JS feature, you can selectively eliminate this file from pages where it is not needed, improving overall page loading times.

[Pro version](#pricing)     **Remove CSS/JS** is only available with W3 Total Cache Pro.

## W3 Total Cache Reviews

I have seen dramatic results with my site. The setup require(s) some time, but at the same time, it gives us the flexibility to customize it as per our requirements.

@ronakonly

W3 Total Cache is the best caching plugin with a ton of very useful features and more one it has great and quick support for any type of queries. I highly recommend using it.

@akashmughal21

Tried a few other cache plugins, my choice of other plugins was not always working well with all of them, this one is having no compatibility issues with any of the rest I run.

@eckiebd

W3TC meets all requirements for my applications and has almost inexhaustible reserves for future requirements.

@knubew

Provides loads of necessary options and a major control over them. Easy to install and config. Great addition is the WEBP support.

@fosfolipid

After a lot of testing and trying, this Plugin provided the final touches – catapulting our SEO score to 94 for one and a whopping 100 for another!

@mmdotcom

I tested the more popular ones, but they were not holding to their claims. Sites were taking forever to load. W3 Total Cache ended up the best.

@imirza

Great plugin, great support, does everything you need it to do. It’s easy enough for a beginner (me), but flexible, and powerful enough for a pro.

@flyguygj

W3 Total Cache has been a total lifesaver for me. Works as it should, very nifty and reliable. A big shout out to the team for putting this together.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why do I need a WordPress Caching Plugin?**

A WordPress caching plugin, such as W3 Total Cache, helps in storing a version of your site’s data, which reduces the time it takes to fetch information from the server. This results in faster page load times and a smoother user experience.

**Do I have to flush the cache every time I update WordPress?**

It depends on what part of your WordPress website you are updating. When installing or removing plugins we recommend purging the cache. If you are doing general website work with pages or posts, there is no need.

**How does licensing work with WordPress Multisite?**

Each WordPress installation needs a unique W3 Total Cache license. Since Multisite is a single install, you’ll only need one license for your network of subdomains.

**What CDNs does W3 Total Cache work with?**

W3 Total Cache will work with any CDN, including Amazon CloudFront, Highwinds, LimeLight, MaxCDN, RackSpace CDN, BunnyCDN, KeyCDN, plus many more. Keep in mind the subscription to your CDN service and W3 Total Cache Pro are separate. Here are a few guides to help with setup:

* [BunnyCDN and W3 Total Cache](https://support.bunny.net/hc/en-us/articles/207790309-How-to-set-up-BunnyCDN-with-WordPress-using-W3-Total-Cache)
* [KeyCDN and W3 Total Cache](https://www.keycdn.com/support/wordpress-cdn-integration-with-w3-total-cache)

**How can I reach support?**

There are several ways to contact W3 Total Cache support, please read our [Scope of Support page](/w3-total-cache/scope-of-support/) for more information.

**WordPress Core has lazy loading, do I need Total Cache lazy loading?**

Since the WordPress 5.5 release, the tag *loading=”lazy”* is automatically added to images. However, you should still use Lazy Loading with W3 Total Cache.

WordPress Core relies on the browser, yet is [not supported fully by many browsers](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr). Since W3 Total Cache uses lightweight JavaScript, it delivers a better user experience for those not using a compatible browser.

**How does W3 Total Cache work with my page builder?**

W3 Total Cache is compatible with all page builders. Below are guides for some popular page builders.

* [Divi Setup Guide](https://www.boldgrid.com/support/w3-total-cache/divi-w3-total-cache-guide/)
* [Avada Setup Guide](https://www.boldgrid.com/support/w3-total-cache/how-to-configure-avada-and-w3-total-cache/)

**Is Total Cache guaranteed to make my site faster?**

We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if the pro features do not provide the results you are looking for.

**What Payment methods do you accept?**

On the [checkout page](https://www.w3-edge.com/checkout-standalone-1/?utm_source=boldgrid&utm_medium=subnav&utm_campaign=BoldGrid), you can pay with either a Credit Card or with a PayPal account.

**\* How do I claim my free Plugin Configuration Service(s)?**

From your WordPress dashboard, visit Performance > Support > Billing Support and use the contact form to request your free Plugin Configuration. Please include your license key. If you purchased the 10 site license, please do this twice – once for each website.

**\* How long do I have to claim my free Plugin Configuration Service(s)?**

Please request your free Plugin Configuration Service(s) within 14 days of purchase. The promotional period begins June 21, 2024 and can end at anytime without prior notice.

**\* What’s included in my free Plugin Configuration Service(s)?**

The deliverable with this service is a faster site. It’s impossible to predict the extent to which our work will improve performance (especially true for code we didn’t write running on servers we didn’t build), our promise is that we’ll do our best. The configuration depends on the availability of the resources on the server. Any configuration related to the W3 Total Cache including the CDN implementation if the CDN provider the user subscribed with offers this option.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

>>
>
> They _must_ be protected. They _must not_ be exposed or
> downloadable. The hash values are raw SQL query responses, so they
> contain things like password hashes. The cache is used only
> internally by the web application, and client browsers should never
> have any direct contact with this cache.

Please use CVE-2012-6079 for this issue.

Thanks for the explanations.
