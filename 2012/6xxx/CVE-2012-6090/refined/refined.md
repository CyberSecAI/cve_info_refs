Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-6090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the `expand_file_name/2` function of SWI-Prolog. This function is used to expand file names, particularly when dealing with long paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow. When expanding file names, especially those with long paths, the function writes data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting the buffer overflow can lead to crashes, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** The vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution. This is possible if an attacker can control the names of the files searched for by the `expand_file_name/2` function. For example, if an application uses this function on a directory where an attacker can upload files with controlled names, they could potentially achieve code execution by crafting specific file names. However, this was considered very hard to do.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Controlled File Names:** An attacker needs to be able to control the file names that are passed to the `expand_file_name/2` function.
*   **File Upload:** A common scenario is in an environment where an attacker can upload files to a directory and then trick the application into processing them through the vulnerable function, potentially gaining arbitrary code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File Manipulation:** An attacker must have the ability to create or control file names in a location where the vulnerable `expand_file_name/2` function is utilized.
*   **Application Interaction:** The attacker needs the application to call the vulnerable function on attacker-controlled file names.

**Additional Notes**

*   The issue affects versions of SWI-Prolog prior to 6.2.5 and 6.3.7.
*   Patches have been provided to address the buffer overflow (both upstream and specific fixes).
*   Red Hat has marked the issue as low severity and stated that they will not fix it in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, since the affected package is only available via the Optional repository with limited support.
