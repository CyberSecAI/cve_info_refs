The provided content relates to CVE-2012-6143.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `Spoon::Cookie` module calls `Storable::thaw()` on session data stored client-side without signature verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data using `Storable::thaw()` without any integrity checks.
- Lack of signature verification mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution by providing malicious serialized data.
- Session hijacking, potentially gaining access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Attacker crafts malicious serialized data.
-  This malicious data is then presented to the vulnerable application through a cookie.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate or forge the cookie data sent to the vulnerable application.
