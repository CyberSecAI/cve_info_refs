The provided content relates to CVE-2012-10009.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `404like` WordPress plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user input (`$searchWord`) before using it in a database query. The plugin extracts the last part of the requested URL, removes slashes, and directly inserts it into an SQL query, leading to the potential for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection: The plugin directly includes the unsanitized `$searchWord` variable in the SQL queries within the `findPostWhereLike` and `findPostWhereLikeNameTitle` functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Attackers can inject malicious SQL code by crafting a URL with SQL injection payloads.
*   Successful exploitation could allow attackers to read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain full control of the WordPress website.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the WordPress site that includes a malicious payload in the URL path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker does not require any authentication or special permissions. They simply need to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
