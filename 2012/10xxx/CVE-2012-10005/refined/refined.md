    "root_cause": "The `filter` method in `PFBC/Base.php` used `str_replace` to replace double quotes with `&quot;`, which is not sufficient to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.",

        "Submitting crafted input through form fields.",
       "Specifically, this input is not being properly sanitized, allowing Javascript code to be injected.",

  },
  "fixes": [
    "The `filter` method in `PFBC/Base.php` was updated to use `htmlspecialchars` for proper output sanitization."
  ],
  "other_details": "The commit message indicates that the change was made in response to a reported issue. The fix involved changing from `str_replace` to `htmlspecialchars` in `PFBC/Base.php`. The vulnerability existed because the earlier function did not properly handle characters, besides double quotes, that can be used to perform XSS. Additionally, a secondary vulnerability where the value of the 'textarea' was not being filtered was fixed by filtering the value."
