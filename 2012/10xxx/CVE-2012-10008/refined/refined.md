Based on the provided commit message and code diffs, this commit addresses MySQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The code was vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user inputs being directly included in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically in the `admin` directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, an attacker might be able to escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** Malicious SQL code could be injected through HTTP requests via parameters like `$_REQUEST['id']`, `$_REQUEST['username']`, `$_REQUEST['password']`, etc.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web application.
- **Understanding of Application Logic:** Knowledge of the application's structure and the parameters used in queries would be beneficial.
- **No authentication required:** Some vulnerabilities may be present without authentication but could require some prior knowledge of existing valid parameters.

**Changes made in commit to address the issue:**
- **Input Sanitization:** The commit introduces the use of `escape()` function in many files to sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries. This function likely uses `mysql_real_escape_string()` or similar to prevent SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message explicitly mentions "a few critical MySQL injection vulnerabilities are fixed in this revision".
- Several files in the admin directory are modified to include `escape` function usage, such as `admin/comments.php`, `admin/easy_question.php`, `admin/gen_pdf.php`, `admin/index.php`, `admin/man_club.php`, `admin/man_notes.php`, `admin/man_questions.php`, `admin/preview.php`, `admin/statistics.php`, `admin/user_detail.php`, `admin/view_recommendation.php`, and `admin/view_submit.php`
- The `admin/index.php` file has the most changes.
