# Limit Login Attempts

By [Johan Eenfeldt](http://devel.kostdoktorn.se)

* [Reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/#reviews)

[Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/limit-login-attempts/)

## Description

Limit the number of login attempts possible both through normal login as well as using auth cookies.

By default WordPress allows unlimited login attempts either through the login page or by sending special cookies. This allows passwords (or hashes) to be brute-force cracked with relative ease.

Limit Login Attempts blocks an Internet address from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries is reached, making a brute-force attack difficult or impossible.

Features

* Limit the number of retry attempts when logging in (for each IP). Fully customizable
* Limit the number of attempts to log in using auth cookies in same way
* Informs user about remaining retries or lockout time on login page
* Optional logging, optional email notification
* Handles server behind reverse proxy
* It is possible to whitelist IPs using a filter. But you probably shouldn‚Äôt. üôÇ

Translations: Bulgarian, Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan, Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Norwegian, Persian, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish

Plugin uses standard actions and filters only.

  Administration interface in WordPress 3.0.4

## Installation

1. Download and extract plugin files to a wp-content/plugin directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface.
3. Customize the settings on the options page, if desired. If your server is located behind a reverse proxy make sure to change this setting.

If you have any questions or problems please make a post here: https://wordpress.org/tags/limit-login-attempts

## FAQ

### Why not reset failed attempts on a successful login?

This is very much by design. Otherwise you could brute force the ‚Äúadmin‚Äù password by logging in as your own user every 4th attempt.

### What is this option about site connection and reverse proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server in between the site and the Internet (perhaps handling caching or load-balancing). This makes getting the correct client IP to block slightly more complicated.

The option default to NOT being behind a proxy ‚Äî which should be by far the common case.

### How do I know if my site is behind a reverse proxy?

You probably are not or you would know. We show a pretty good guess on the option page. Set the option using this unless you are sure you know better.

### Can I whitelist my IP so I don‚Äôt get locked out?

First please consider if you really need this. Generally speaking it is not a good idea to have exceptions to your security policies.

That said, there is now a filter which allows you to do it: ‚Äúlimit\_login\_whitelist\_ip‚Äù.

Example:

function my\_ip\_whitelist($allow, $ip) {

return ($ip == ‚Äòmy-ip‚Äô) ? true : $allow;

}

add\_filter(‚Äòlimit\_login\_whitelist\_ip‚Äô, ‚Äòmy\_ip\_whitelist‚Äô, 10, 2);

Note that we still do notification and logging as usual. This is meant to allow you to be aware of any suspicious activity from whitelisted IPs.

### I locked myself out testing this thing, what do I do?

Either wait, or:

If you know how to edit / add to PHP files you can use the IP whitelist functionality described above. You should then use the ‚ÄúRestore Lockouts‚Äù button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.

If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file ‚Äúwp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php‚Äù to deactivate the plugin.

If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit\_login\_lockouts option in the wordpress options table. In a default setup this would work: ‚ÄúUPDATE wp\_options SET option\_value = ‚Äù WHERE option\_name = ‚Äòlimit\_login\_lockouts‚Äô‚Äù

I absolutely hate bloated plugins, so I love this one. It‚Äôs simple and works as expected. Guess it‚Äôs wise to use a plugin such as this one, against brute force attacks.

Does what it says on the tin. Like another similar plugin before it became bloatware. The only feature I would request is the ability to send notifications to another email address, I like to keep my admin email clean.

Se lo pone m√°s dic√≠cil a los hackers que quieren acceder a tu blog ya que les limita el n√∫mero de accesos.

Would be good to get new versions and fix possible security issues (if any), but it seems to still work.
