The provided content relates to a commit that addresses an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability in the `basic_cart` module for Backdrop CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The module was using `variable_get` to retrieve email messages, including the admin and user email bodies, which were then directly included in the email. These email bodies could be set by a malicious user to include malicious HTML or JavaScript, which could be executed in the context of the recipientâ€™s browser when the email is rendered. This can happen because the module used to send emails using the content from variables directly, without sanitizing user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The module was vulnerable to stored XSS because it did not properly sanitize the email body content before sending them out.
- **Improper Input Handling:** It relied on user-controlled variables for content displayed in emails, which could include malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the admin or user email bodies via the module's admin settings page.
- When these emails are viewed, the injected scripts would execute in the victim's browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the email content.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of the Backdrop CMS. Specifically, the attacker needs to have permissions to change the module's admin settings.
- The attacker would modify the email body settings through the module's admin interface, inserting the malicious scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient privileges to access and modify the `basic_cart` module's settings page in the Backdrop CMS admin interface.
- No additional capabilities are required beyond the ability to inject the malicious payload into email content.

**Changes in the commit:**
The commit addresses the XSS vulnerability by:
- Using `filter_xss` to sanitize the email message bodies before they are used.
- Using `check_plain` to sanitize the email subjects before they are used in the `hook_mail` implementation.
- Removing an unnessecary usage of the `drupal_mail_system` in `basic_cart_checkout_form_submit`, and directly using `drupal_mail` in conjunction with `basic_cart_mail`

This commit also includes refactoring, by:
- Renaming form variables to include the module name, which results in more consistent naming of the variables used to save and retrieve configuration.
- Some minor template cleanup.
