The provided content is a commit from the `contact-form-plugin` repository on GitHub. The commit message states "Cross Site Request Forgery bug was fixed".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This is evident from the commit message and the code diff.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code diff shows a change in the `cntctfrm_settings_page` function. Specifically, it adds a check for a valid nonce when processing the form submission:
```diff
-    if( isset( $_REQUEST['cntctfrm_form_submit'] ) ) {
+    if( isset( $_REQUEST['cntctfrm_form_submit'] ) && check_admin_referer( plugin_basename(__FILE__), 'cntctfrm_nonce_name' ) ) {
```
This indicates that previously, the plugin was vulnerable to CSRF attacks because it did not validate the origin of the settings update request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially modify the plugin settings without the user's consent through a malicious request. This could lead to various impacts, such as:

*   Changing the recipient email address, causing contact form submissions to be sent to the attacker.
*   Modifying other settings to disrupt the plugin's functionality or gain other forms of access.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted malicious request that exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin's settings update functionality. An attacker could trick an authenticated administrator into clicking a malicious link or loading a page containing the malicious request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator to trigger a crafted request. This could be achieved via:
*   Phishing.
*   Social engineering.
*   Cross-site scripting if the target site is vulnerable to XSS.
