Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit introduces a security measure to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. The core change is the inclusion of `$seguridad->escapeSQL($_POST);` or `$seguridad->escapeSQL($_GET);` in multiple PHP files. This indicates that the previous code was vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user inputs being directly used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code was previously vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. User-supplied data (through `$_POST` or `$_GET`) was being used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** If successfully exploited, SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information, modify data, or even take control of the database server.
- **Application Compromise:** It can lead to complete compromise of the application if the database user has necessary permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests with malicious input via `$_POST` parameters (in files that use `$_POST`) and `$_GET` parameters (in files that use `$_GET`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker must know or be able to infer the parameters used by the application which is relatively easy with basic web application knowledge.
- No special privileges are necessary except for access to the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The code commit explicitly addresses the vulnerability by introducing an `escapeSQL` function. This indicates an awareness of the SQL injection risk and an attempt to mitigate it. However, the commit message also states "(parcialmente/ faltan validaciones concretas contra caracteres % para evitar danos al SO)." which suggests that while SQL injection is being mitigated, there might be other vulnerabilities such as OS command injection related to the use of the '%' character (likely in conjunction with `LIKE` operator in SQL queries) that still need addressing.
- The files modified are mostly related to data loading and manipulation actions, indicating that any of them could have been entry points for SQL injection.

In summary, this commit addresses a significant SQL injection vulnerability by escaping/sanitizing user inputs. The fact that many files were changed for this purpose suggests this was a pervasive issue.
