Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-0911:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `unserialize()` function in multiple Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware scripts with user-controlled input. Specifically, the scripts `bannerlib.php`, `tiki-print_multi_pages.php`, `tiki-print_pages.php`, and `tiki-send_objects.php` use `unserialize()` on data from cookies or URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The core weakness is the insecure use of PHP's `unserialize()` function. By crafting a malicious serialized PHP object and providing it as input, an attacker can trigger the execution of arbitrary code when the object is unserialized. This is because the `unserialize()` function can invoke the `__destruct()` method on a crafted object.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerable scripts fail to properly sanitize user-supplied data before passing it to `unserialize()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the Tiki Wiki installation and potentially the entire server.
- **Full System Control:** With RCE, an attacker can perform various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing sensitive information from the database.
    - Modifying content.
    - Uploading malicious files.
    - Using the compromised server as a bot in a botnet.
    - Pivoting to other systems on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookies:** The `bannerlib.php` script uses `unserialize()` on data from cookies.
- **HTTP GET/POST Parameters:** The `tiki-print_multi_pages.php`, `tiki-print_pages.php`, and `tiki-send_objects.php` scripts use `unserialize()` on data from URL parameters (`printpages`, `printstructures`, `sendpages`, `sendstructures`, `sendarticles`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Tiki Wiki server to send HTTP requests with malicious serialized objects.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable Tiki Wiki version and the location of vulnerable scripts.
- **PHP Environment:** The exploit relies on a PHP environment older than 5.3.4 to allow null byte poisoning in file system functions. Also, `display_errors` needs to be On to leak the path of the application.
- **Tiki Wiki Multiprint Feature Enabled:** In order to exploit the `tiki-print_multi_pages.php`, the MultiPrint feature of Tiki Wiki has to be enabled.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided exploit code leverages the `Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy` class to write arbitrary code to a file in the Tiki Wiki web directory.
- The vulnerability was reported by Egidio Romano (EgiX).
- Tiki versions 6.8 LTS and 9.2 LTS address this vulnerability. Tiki 8.x is End-of-Life.
- The exploit utilizes a full path disclosure vulnerability in `tiki-rss_error.php` to determine the installation path.
