```
(CVE) ID: CVE-2012-0503
```
**Summary of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability identified as CVE-2012-0503 relates to an unrestricted use of the `TimeZone.setDefault()` method in OpenJDK. This method, which should be protected by a security manager invocation, lacks this protection, allowing untrusted Java applets or applications to set a new default time zone.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `java.util.TimeZone.setDefault()` method can be called without a security manager invocation, bypassing intended restrictions.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of access control on `TimeZone.setDefault()`.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could exploit this by using an untrusted Java application or applet.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to execute an untrusted Java application or applet within the affected system.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to an untrusted Java application or applet being able to set a new default time zone.

**Additional Information from Analyzed Content:**

*   Multiple sources confirm this vulnerability affects various versions of IBM Java and OpenJDK.
*   Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian have released security updates to address this issue in their respective distributions.
*   HP also addresses this issue, specifically mentioning it in the context of HP-UX systems running affected Java versions.
