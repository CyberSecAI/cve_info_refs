Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The wicd (Wired and Wireless Network Manager) application was logging sensitive information, such as passwords and passphrases, directly into its log files located in `/var/log/wicd`. This was happening due to debug statements printing the values of configuration options without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive credentials in log files.
- **Insecure Logging Practices**: The application was logging sensitive data in a readable format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised Credentials:** Attackers who gain access to the log files can obtain plaintext passwords and passphrases, which may enable them to access wireless networks or other resources using the compromised credentials.
- **Increased Attack Surface:** The exposure of credentials increases the potential for further attacks.
- **Privacy Violation:** Exposure of private information to unauthorized users, and potential accidental exposure via sharing logs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system, and specifically to the `/var/log/wicd` directory, could read the log files. Users belonging to the "adm" group typically have read access to such logs, expanding the scope of potential attackers.
- **Accidental Exposure:** If a user submits debug logs in bug reports, they might inadvertently expose the sensitive information, especially if they're unaware of the logging issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The primary requirement is the ability to read files in the `/var/log/wicd` directory which are typically accessible by 'root' and members of the 'adm' group.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by masking sensitive information in the log files, which essentially means replacing the sensitive values with "*****" or similar strings in the logging output, as shown in the provided code diff.
- The fix was introduced in wicd version 1.7.1~b3-4 and later, and the issue was also resolved upstream in the experimental branch.
-  The Debian security tracker notes that log files are accessible by `root:adm`, and the issue is not a security problem by itself but the risk of exposing sensitive data via bug reports elevates the severity.
- Gentoo's security advisory also highlights this vulnerability, alongside another one, where the local attacker can gain privileges.
