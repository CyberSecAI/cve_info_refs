Based on the provided content, here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2012-0418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the GroupWise Client for Windows, which can be exploited by enticing a target user to open a malicious file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a remote code execution vulnerability that exists within the GroupWise Client for Windows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to gain code execution within the security context of the affected user. This means the attacker can potentially perform actions with the same privileges as the user, possibly leading to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities. Alternatively, the application may crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a remote attacker sending or tricking the target user into opening a malicious file. This could involve malicious attachments, phishing emails with links to download a file, or other social engineering tactics.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious file to a target user. This typically means being able to send the malicious file to the target. The attacker does not need any special permissions or access to the target's system beyond being able to send a file. The attacker can be remote, and they do not need to be on the same local network.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects GroupWise 8.0x up to and including 8.02HP3 and GroupWise 2012.
- The fix involves upgrading to GroupWise 8.0 Support Pack 3 (or later) or GroupWise 2012 Support Pack 1.
- It was discovered and reported by Pavel Polischouk with Telus Security Labs.
