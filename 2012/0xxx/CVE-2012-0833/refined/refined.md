      "content": "A flaw was found [1] in the way 389 handled certificate groups with authentication. If a 389 server were configured to use certificate groups, and had an aci that included a certificate group, it would be possible a remote, authenticated user to cause 389 to enter an infinite loop and consume all available CPU, causing it to stop responding to further requests.\n\nThe root cause of this vulnerability is a flaw in the `strcmpi_fast` function, which is used for string comparison within the 389 Directory Server.  The function can enter an infinite loop when processing specific user entries with the `memberCertificateDescription` attribute. The vulnerability occurs when an Access Control Instruction (ACI) references a certificate group that is associated with a user. When an authenticated user attempts to access this entry, the server attempts to resolve the ACI, leading to the flawed string comparison function being called.\n\nThe vulnerability is triggered when the server processes an entry containing a `memberCertificateDescription` attribute, as this triggers the problematic code path within the Access Control List (ACL) evaluation. The `strcmpi_fast` function would get stuck in a loop, leading to high CPU usage and server unresponsiveness.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. When the server enters the infinite loop, it consumes all available CPU resources, rendering it unable to process further requests. This results in the server becoming unresponsive to legitimate user requests.\n\nThe attack vector is remote and requires an authenticated user. The attacker must be able to log into the directory server. The attacker then has to trigger access to an entry which has memberCertificateDescription attribute and an ACI defined using a certificate group. Each attempt to access this entry causes one server thread to spin.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the 389 Directory Server and cause a search against a user entry that will trigger the vulnerable code within the server.",
