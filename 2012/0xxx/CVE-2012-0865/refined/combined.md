# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

===========================================================================================
CubeCart 3.0.20 (3.0.x) and lower | Open URL Redirection Vulnerability (CVE-2012-0865)
===========================================================================================
1. OVERVIEW
The CubeCart 3.0.20 and lower versions are vulnerable to Open URL Redirection.
2. BACKGROUND
CubeCart is an "out of the box" ecommerce shopping cart software solution which has been written to run on servers that have PHP & MySQL support. With CubeCart you can quickly setup a powerful online store which can be used to sell digital or tangible products to new and existing customers all over the world.
3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
The CubeCart 3.0.20 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a remote cross site redirection attack. This flaw exists because the application does not properly sanitise the parameters,"goto", "r" and "redir". This allows an attacker to create a specially crafted URL, that if clicked, would redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site to an arbitrary web site of the attacker's choice.
4. VERSIONS AFFECTED
3.0.20 and lower (aka 3.0.x family)
5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

The CubeCart 3.0.20 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a
remote cross site redirection attack. This flaw exists because the
application does not properly sanitise the parameters,"goto" and "r".
This allows an attacker to create a specially crafted URL, that if
clicked, would redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site
(domain.com) to an arbitrary web site (localhost) of the attacker's
choice.

4. VERSIONS AFFECTED
