Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0865:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied parameters within the CubeCart application. Specifically, the parameters "goto", "r", and "redir" are not being adequately validated before being used in redirection operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open URL Redirection:** The primary vulnerability is an open URL redirection flaw. This means that an attacker can manipulate URL parameters to redirect users to an arbitrary website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-site Redirection:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can redirect users from a legitimate CubeCart website to a malicious website of their choice.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** This can be used to facilitate phishing attacks, where users might be tricked into providing sensitive information on the attacker-controlled site, believing it to be the legitimate one.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to websites that host malware, potentially infecting their systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted URLs:** Attackers craft malicious URLs containing the vulnerable parameters ("goto", "r", and "redir") with a target URL pointing to a malicious site.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires users to click on these specially crafted links for the redirection to occur.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct URLs with specific parameter values that lead to a malicious redirection.
*   **Social Engineering/Dissemination:** Attackers usually need some method to distribute these crafted links to potential victims, such as sending emails or posting them on social media.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in CubeCart version 3.0.20 and lower, also known as the 3.0.x family.
*   The vendor no longer maintains the 3.0.x versions.
*   The suggested solution is to upgrade to a newer version of CubeCart (4.x or 5.x), where this issue is reportedly resolved.
*   The vulnerability was initially disclosed on 2012-02-10, and updated on 2012-02-19 to include "redir" as an additional vulnerable parameter.

The provided content includes proof-of-concept URLs that demonstrate how the vulnerability can be exploited:
*   `http://localhost/cube3.0.20/switch.php?r=//yehg.net/&lang=es`
*   `http://localhost/cube3.0.20/admin/login.php?goto=//yehg.net`
*   `/index.php?act=login&redir=Ly95ZWhnLm5ldC8%3D`
*   `/cart.php?act=reg&redir=L2N1YmUvaW5kZXgucGhwP2FjdD1sb2dpbg%3D%3D`

These URLs showcase how attackers can manipulate the parameters `r`, `goto`, and `redir` to cause a redirection to an arbitrary URL (in this example, `yehg.net`).
