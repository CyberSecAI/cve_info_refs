Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-0807:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the Suhosin extension for PHP, specifically within the transparent cookie encryption feature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient bounds checking when handling strings in cookie encryption/decryption functions.
- Specifically, the `suhosin_encrypt_single_cookie` and `suhosin_decrypt_single_cookie` functions were vulnerable to stack buffer overflows. The functions used fixed size buffers (`buffer` and `buffer2`) of 4096 bytes and did not properly handle cases where input string length exceeded this fixed size. 
- The vulnerability is triggered by long strings used in `Set-Cookie` HTTP headers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the server.
- Denial of service is also a possibility.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests with long strings in the `Set-Cookie` header that are processed by PHP through the vulnerable Suhosin extension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The target server needs to have the Suhosin extension enabled and the transparent cookie encryption feature activated (`suhosin.cookie.encrypt`).
- The server needs to be running an application that uses the `header()` function to send `Set-Cookie` headers with potentially unfiltered user input.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a `Set-Cookie` header with a long string that triggers the overflow.
- The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the encryption key.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `header.c` of the Suhosin extension
- The issue was fixed in Suhosin version 0.9.33, commit `73b1968ee30f6d9d2dae497544b910e68e114bfa`.
-  Modern Unix systems often compile the Suhosin extension with the `FORTIFY_SOURCE` flag, which could help detect and prevent this type of buffer overflow, however the vulnerability is still exploitable if this is not set.
