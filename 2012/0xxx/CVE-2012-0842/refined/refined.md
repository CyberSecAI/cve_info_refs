Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-0842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `surf` web browser's insecure handling of its cookie storage. Specifically, the directory where cookies are stored (`~/.surf/`) and the cookie file (`cookies.txt`) within it were being created with world-readable permissions (0755 for directory and -rw-r--r-- for file by default).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is that the cookie jar file and directory are created with permissions that allow any local user to read them. This means that other users on the same system can access the cookies stored by the `surf` browser.
*   **Confidentiality Violation:** Cookie data often contains sensitive information such as session IDs and authentication tokens, and user preferences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read the cookie data of other users, which may allow them to impersonate those users on websites, gain access to their accounts, and obtain other personal information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable `surf` browser is being used to read the cookie files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the same system where the vulnerable `surf` browser is being used.
*   **No elevated privileges:** They do not need to be root to access the cookie files

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was identified in `surf` version 0.4.1-4.1
*   The fix involves changing permissions to 0700 for the directory and ensure appropriate permissions for file creation.
*   The fix was addressed in `surf` version 0.4.1-6 in Debian and surf 0.5 in Fedora.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity by Ubuntu, but "grave" by Debian
*  The CVSS v3 score is 5.5 (Medium) with an attack vector of "Local", low complexity and low privileges required.
