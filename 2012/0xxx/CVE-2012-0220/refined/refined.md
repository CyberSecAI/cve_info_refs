```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper escaping of the author's name and URL in metadata (such as comments) by ikiwiki.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the author field of comments or other metadata, which will then be executed in the browsers of users viewing the affected content. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or other attacks.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a page containing metadata with a malicious author name or URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious author name or URL in metadata such as a comment. This can be done through a public interface allowing comments or through direct manipulation of the data.
