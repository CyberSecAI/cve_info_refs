- Root cause of vulnerability: An object confusion vulnerability exists within Adobe Flash Player that could be exploited through specially-crafted SWF content.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability allows for object confusion within the Flash Player, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation could lead to application crashes and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system by executing arbitrary code.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered when a user loads a page containing a malicious SWF file, which can be delivered via email or other means.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to craft a malicious SWF file and deliver it to the victim, tricking them into opening or loading it in a Flash Player environment. The attacker does not require any authentication, or local or physical access.
