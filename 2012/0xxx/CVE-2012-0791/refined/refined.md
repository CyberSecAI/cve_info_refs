Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2012-0791:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content directly references CVE-2012-0791 in multiple places, including:
    *   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 2485-1)
    *   The Openwall mailing list discussion
    *   The commit message on GitHub
*   The vulnerability description in these sources matches, referring to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaws in Horde IMP.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within Horde IMP.  Specifically, the vulnerability is due to improper handling of user-supplied data, allowing injection of malicious code.
* The commit message states `[mms] SECURITY: Fix XSS vulnerabilities on the compose page (traditional view), the contacts popup window, and with certain IMAP mailbox names.`

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist. These vulnerabilities are triggered in three areas:
    *   The compose page (traditional view)
    *   The contacts popup window
    *   Certain IMAP mailbox names

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of a user's browser session.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting malicious payloads within the parameters of the vulnerable areas: the compose page, the contacts popup window, and IMAP mailbox names.
    *   The injection happens when a user is composing an email, using the contacts feature or accessing specific mailboxes.
*  The provided github diff shows sanitization using `filter_var` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` to mitigate XSS on some of the affected parameters.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted input to the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker does not need to be logged in or otherwise authenticated to perform the attack.  This makes the attack vector "remote".
* The specific details of crafted input depend on the location of the vulnerable area within the application (e.g., what form parameter, etc.).

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix for CVE-2012-0791 was included in Horde IMP v5.0.18. It's also mentioned that Webmail 4.0.6 includes the fix for at least some of the vulnerabilities.
*   The Openwall message mentions that an additional XSS vulnerability in email validation (related to the Form library) was given a separate CVE ID (CVE-2012-0909) because it was a different product/version (Webmail 4.0.6).
* The github commit log also contains the fixes for the XSS identified in this CVE.
*   Debian Security Advisory DSA-2485-1 indicates that the vulnerabilities were fixed in version `4.3.7+debian0-2.2` for the stable (squeeze) distribution of Debian.
*   The changelog from the Horde website provides a more detailed view of all changes in version 5.0.18 of Horde IMP.
