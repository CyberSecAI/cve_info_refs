Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Remote Login Service (RLS) was not correctly clearing previously stored server information when a new user logged in. Instead, it would accumulate server details from prior sessions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inadequate session management: The service failed to properly purge or invalidate server data linked to previous users when a new user initiated a session.
- Information disclosure: The accumulated server data exposed sensitive information, potentially related to remote login configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Credentials Disclosure: A local attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information by logging into RLS after another user has logged in and not used the results. This could expose servers the previous user was connected to.
- Unauthorized Access: The attacker might leverage the disclosed information for unauthorized access to remote systems if the information contained passwords or configuration details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The vulnerability is exploitable by a local user who has access to a machine where RLS is running.
- Multi-user Scenario: It requires multiple users logging into the same machine and the first user not using the results from RLS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical or remote access to a machine with the vulnerable RLS installed.
- The ability to login to the machine after another user has logged in to RLS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that a patch was created to clear server information on subsequent logins, mitigating the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is considered a security issue but was deemed "unlikely" because it relies on specific user behavior and a multi-user environment.
- The fix involved modifying `src/uccs-server.c` to clear server data and adding a test case to `tests/dbus-interface.c`.
- The vulnerability was addressed in `remote-login-service` version `1.0.0-0ubuntu1.1` for Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal) and `1.0.0-0ubuntu2` for Raring.
