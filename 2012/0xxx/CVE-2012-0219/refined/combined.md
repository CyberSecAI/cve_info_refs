# socat: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **201208-01**

arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/socat** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.7.2.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.7.2.1** |

### Background

socat is a multipurpose bidirectional relay, similar to netcat.

### Description

A vulnerability in the "xioscan\_readline()" function in xio-readline.c
could cause a heap-based buffer overflow.

### Impact

privileges of the socat process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All socat users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/socat-1.7.2.1"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Socat security advisory 3

## Overview

A heap based buffer overflow vulnerability has been found with data that happens to be output on the READLINE address.

Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the socat process.

## Vulnerability Ids

CVE-2012-0219

## Details

This vulnerability can be exploited when socat is invoked with the
READLINE address (this is usually only used interactively) without option
"prompt" and without option "noprompt" and an attacker succeeds to
provide malicious data to the other (arbitrary) address that is then
transferred by socat to the READLINE address for output.

The problem was caused by a coding error in function xioscan\_readline().

## Testcase

To check your socat program do the following:

perl -e 'print "\r"."A"x 513' </tmp/socat-data
socat readline exec:'cat /tmp/socat-data'

When socat crashes with a signal (e.g. SIGSEGV) and does not output any
'A' it is vulnerable.

## Workaround

Use option [prompt](../doc/socat.html#OPTION_PROMPT) or
option [noprompt](../doc/socat.html#OPTION_NOPROMPT) with the
READLINE address.

## Affected versions

1.4.0.0 - 1.7.2.0

2.0.0-b1 - 2.0.0-b4

## Not affected or corrected versions

1.0.0.0 - 1.3.2.2

1.7.2.1 and later

2.0.0-b5 and later

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: socat security advisory

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Socat security advisory 3

Overview
  A heap based buffer overflow vulnerability has been found with data
  that happens to be output on the READLINE address. Successful
  exploitation may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with
  the privileges of the socat process.

Vulnerability Id: CVE-2012-0219

Details
  This vulnerability can be exploited when socat is invoked with the
  READLINE address (this is usually only used interactively) without
  option "prompt" and without option "noprompt" and an attacker
  succeeds to provide malicious data to the other (arbitrary) address
  that is then transferred by socat to the  READLINE address for
  output.
  The problem was caused by a coding error in function
  xioscan_readline().

Testcase
  To check your socat program do the following:

    perl -e 'print "\r"."A"x 513' >/tmp/socat-data
    socat readline exec:'cat /tmp/socat-data'

  When socat crashes with a signal (e.g. SIGSEGV) and does not output
  any 'A' it is vulnerable.

Workaround
  Use option "prompt" or option "noprompt" with the READLINE address.
