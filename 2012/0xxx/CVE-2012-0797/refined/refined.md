Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0797:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from unsynchronized access control when using web service tokens in Moodle. Specifically, a user who has been deleted on the server could still access the site using an existing valid web service token. This lack of synchronization between user deletion and token invalidation allowed for continued access by unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inconsistent State:** The system failed to properly invalidate or revoke web service tokens upon user deletion, leading to an inconsistent state. The user was marked as deleted internally, but their access token remained valid.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The core issue is that token validation was not sufficiently tied to the current user status. The system was checking for the token validity, but not the user's active status. This resulted in an authorization bypass, where a deleted user could use the token to bypass normal access controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A deleted user, who should no longer have access to the platform, could potentially continue using their previously granted token to access resources and perform actions. This unauthorized access could lead to data breaches, modification, or other malicious activity within the Moodle instance.
*   **Data Exposure:** The unauthorized user could potentially access sensitive user data, course content, or other information that should be inaccessible to deleted accounts.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** Continued access could be leveraged for further malicious activities, including injecting malicious code or escalating privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web Service API:** The vulnerability is specifically related to the web service functionality of Moodle and the use of authentication tokens associated with users.
*   **Exploiting existing tokens:** An attacker needs a valid web service token, which might be obtained before the user is deleted, or potentially if the token is shared or exposed somehow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Valid web service token:** The attacker must possess a valid web service token associated with a user who was later deleted from the system.
*   **Knowledge of API endpoints:** The attacker would need knowledge of the Moodle web service APIs to leverage the tokens.
*   **No required privileges:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges initially. The vulnerability is that a deleted user's tokens are not revoked.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as "MSA-12-0008" in the Moodle Security Announcements.
*   The vulnerability affected Moodle versions 2.2, 2.1 to 2.1.3+, and 2.0 to 2.0.6+. Version 1.9 was not affected.
*   The fix for this issue was addressed in Moodle by ensuring web service tokens are invalidated upon user deletion.
*   The commit that addresses the issue is referenced as MDL-28126 within Moodle's git repository.
