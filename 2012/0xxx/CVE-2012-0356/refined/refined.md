Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-0356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is implemented in Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) and Cisco ASA Software. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of PIM messages, causing a device reload when multicast routing is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of PIM messages when multicast routing is enabled on affected Cisco devices.
- Specifically, the issue is in how the device processes a crafted PIM message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service condition, causing the affected Cisco device (FWSM or ASA) to reload. This results in service disruption and network downtime.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through sending a specially crafted PIM message to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device that includes crafted PIM messages.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same local network, since the access vector is network.

**Additional Notes:**
- Multicast routing is disabled by default, but if enabled, PIM is automatically enabled on all interfaces.
- This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall modes (only routed for ASA).
- Only IPv4 PIM messages can trigger the vulnerability (for ASA), since PIM over IPv6 is not supported.
- Cisco FWSM and ASA devices with multicast routing enabled are vulnerable, specifically when PIM is enabled on an interface.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted PIM message.
