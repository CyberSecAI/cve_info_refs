{
  "CVE-2012-0250": {
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow in the OSPFv2 implementation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper length check of the Network-LSA structures within an LS-Update OSPF packet"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (daemon crash).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted OSPF Link State Update (LS Update) packet containing a network-LSA link-state advertisement, where the data-structure length is smaller than the value in the Length header field"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to form an OSPF adjacency with the attacked OSPF router and initiate a database exchange process with it. OSPF security precautions such as MD5 authentication may lower the risk of exploitation"
    ],
      "More details": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing Network-LSA structures within an LS-Update OSPF packet. If the 'Length' header field is larger than the actual buffer, a buffer overflow occurs leading to a crash of OSPF protocol process and disruption of IPv4 routing."
