Debian Security Advisory DSA-2459-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Florian Weimer
April 26, 2012                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : quagga
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0249 CVE-2012-0250 CVE-2012-0255

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing
daemon.

CVE-2012-0249
	A buffer overflow in the ospf_ls_upd_list_lsa function in the
	OSPFv2 implementation allows remote attackers to cause a
	denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a
	Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet that is smaller than
	the length specified in its header.

CVE-2012-0250
	A buffer overflow in the OSPFv2 implementation allows remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a
	Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet containing a
	network-LSA link-state advertisement for which the
	data-structure length is smaller than the value in the Length
	header field.

CVE-2012-0255
	The BGP implementation does not properly use message buffers
	for OPEN messages, which allows remote attackers impersonating
	a configured BGP peer to cause a denial of service (assertion
	failure and daemon exit) via a message associated with a
	malformed AS4 capability.

This security update upgrades the quagga package to the most recent
upstream release.  This release includes other corrections, such as
hardening against unknown BGP path attributes.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.20.1-0+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.20.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=802829#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-13 15:20:35 UTC  ``` A denial service flaw was found in the way Quagga's ospfd daemon processed certain OSPF LS-Update packets.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1258)

## Topic

Updated quagga packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Quagga is a TCP/IP based routing software suite. The Quagga bgpd daemon
implements the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing protocol. The Quagga
ospfd and ospf6d daemons implement the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
routing protocol.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the bgpd daemon
processed malformed Extended Communities path attributes. An attacker could
send a specially-crafted BGP message, causing bgpd on a target system to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running bgpd. The UPDATE message would have to arrive from an explicitly
configured BGP peer, but could have originated elsewhere in the BGP
network. (CVE-2011-3327)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the bgpd daemon
processed malformed route Extended Communities attributes. A configured
BGP peer could crash bgpd on a target system via a specially-crafted BGP
message. (CVE-2010-1674)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the ospf6d daemon
processed malformed Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use
this flaw to crash ospf6d on an adjacent router. (CVE-2011-3323)

A flaw was found in the way the ospf6d daemon processed malformed link
state advertisements. An OSPF neighbor could use this flaw to crash
ospf6d on a target system. (CVE-2011-3324)

A flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed malformed Hello
packets. An OSPF neighbor could use this flaw to crash ospfd on a
target system. (CVE-2011-3325)

A flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed malformed link state
advertisements. An OSPF router in the autonomous system could use this flaw
to crash ospfd on a target system. (CVE-2011-3326)

An assertion failure was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed
certain Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use this flaw to
cause ospfd on an adjacent router to abort. (CVE-2012-0249)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed
certain Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use this flaw to
crash ospfd on an adjacent router. (CVE-2012-0250)

Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting CVE-2011-3327,
CVE-2011-3323, CVE-2011-3324, CVE-2011-3325, and CVE-2011-3326; and the
CERT/CC for reporting CVE-2012-0249 and CVE-2012-0250. CERT-FI acknowledges
Riku Hietamaki, Tuomo Untinen and Jukka Taimisto of the Codenomicon CROSS
project as the original reporters of CVE-2011-3327, CVE-2011-3323,
CVE-2011-3324, CVE-2011-3325, and CVE-2011-3326. The CERT/CC acknowledges
Martin Winter at OpenSourceRouting.org as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-0249 and CVE-2012-0250.

Users of quagga should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the bgpd, ospfd, and ospf6d daemons will be restarted
automatically.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1259)

## Topic

Updated quagga packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Quagga is a TCP/IP based routing software suite. The Quagga bgpd daemon
implements the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing protocol. The Quagga
ospfd and ospf6d daemons implement the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
routing protocol.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the bgpd daemon
processed malformed Extended Communities path attributes. An attacker could
send a specially-crafted BGP message, causing bgpd on a target system to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running bgpd. The UPDATE message would have to arrive from an explicitly
configured BGP peer, but could have originated elsewhere in the BGP
network. (CVE-2011-3327)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the ospf6d daemon
processed malformed Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use
this flaw to crash ospf6d on an adjacent router. (CVE-2011-3323)

A flaw was found in the way the ospf6d daemon processed malformed link
state advertisements. An OSPF neighbor could use this flaw to crash
ospf6d on a target system. (CVE-2011-3324)

A flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed malformed Hello
packets. An OSPF neighbor could use this flaw to crash ospfd on a
target system. (CVE-2011-3325)

A flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed malformed link state
advertisements. An OSPF router in the autonomous system could use this flaw
to crash ospfd on a target system. (CVE-2011-3326)

An assertion failure was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed
certain Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use this flaw to
cause ospfd on an adjacent router to abort. (CVE-2012-0249)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the ospfd daemon processed
certain Link State Update packets. An OSPF router could use this flaw to
crash ospfd on an adjacent router. (CVE-2012-0250)

Two flaws were found in the way the bgpd daemon processed certain BGP OPEN
messages. A configured BGP peer could cause bgpd on a target system to
abort via a specially-crafted BGP OPEN message. (CVE-2012-0255,
CVE-2012-1820)

Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting CVE-2011-3327,
CVE-2011-3323, CVE-2011-3324, CVE-2011-3325, and CVE-2011-3326; and the
CERT/CC for reporting CVE-2012-0249, CVE-2012-0250, CVE-2012-0255, and
CVE-2012-1820. CERT-FI acknowledges Riku Hietamäki, Tuomo Untinen and Jukka
Taimisto of the Codenomicon CROSS project as the original reporters of
CVE-2011-3327, CVE-2011-3323, CVE-2011-3324, CVE-2011-3325, and
CVE-2011-3326. The CERT/CC acknowledges Martin Winter at
OpenSourceRouting.org as the original reporter of CVE-2012-0249,
CVE-2012-0250, and CVE-2012-0255, and Denis Ovsienko as the original
reporter of CVE-2012-1820.

Users of quagga should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the bgpd, ospfd, and ospf6d daemons will be restarted
automatically.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=817580#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-30 14:39:21 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way Quagga's bgpd daemon processed certain OPEN messages. A configured Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) peer could send a BGP OPEN message with specially-crafted value of the Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) capability Type/Length/Value (TLV) triplet, which would cause the master BGP daemon (bgpd) to abort with an assertion failure by processing of such a message. Also, all BGP sessions established by the attacked router would be closed and its BGP routing disrupted.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=817580#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-30 14:49:02 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of the quagga package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the quagga package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=817580#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-06 10:50:53 UTC  ``` US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#962587: [1] <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/962587>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=817580#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-06 10:53:31 UTC  ``` Created quagga tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 829266](show_bug.cgi?id=829266 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1820 quagga (bgpd): Assertion failure by processing BGP OPEN message with malformed ORF capability TLV (VU#962587) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=817580#c7)  Denis Ovsienko    2012-06-06 11:10:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 589837](attachment.cgi?id=589837&action=diff "fixing patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=589837&action=edit "fixing patch") fixing patch  Attached is a copy of the original fix: <https://github.com/Quagga-RE/quagga-RE/commit/790d1e263e8800bc49d0038d481591ecb4e37b88>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=817580#c8)  Fedora Update System    2012-06-19 14:55:42 UTC  ``` quagga-0.99.21-2.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

## Quagga contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#551715

Original Release Date: 2012-03-23 | Last Revised: 2012-03-28

---

### Overview

Quagga, a routing software suite, contains multiple vulnerabilities that result in a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| Quagga 0.99.20 and previous versions are susceptible to various denial-of-service conditions. The Quagga advisories state the following:  ***CVE-2012-0249******:*** ***E******rror in OSPF parsing LS-Update messages Can Cause a Crash of Quagga ospfd****The ospfd implementation of OSPF in Quagga allows a remote attacker (on a local network segment with OSPF enabled) to cause a denial of service (daemon aborts due to an assert) with a malformed OSPF LS-Update message.**Program Impacted: Quagga (ospfd)**Description:**OSPFv2 implementation in Quagga version 0.99.20 and before does not perform a proper length check for a received LS-Update OSPF packet. A received packet, which has actually less bytes, than it is declared in its header, causes a buffer overflow, which immediately leads to a crash of OSPF protocol process and subsequent disruption of IPv4 routing.**Like many other OSPF cases, exploiting this vulnerability requires an ability to form an OSPF adjacency with the attacked OSPF router and initiate a database exchange process with it. Usual OSPF security precautions (including MD5 authentication) may lower the risk of such event. Upgrading to a patched version of Quagga is recommended regardless of any other measures taken.****CVE-2012-0250: Error in OSPF parsing Network-LSA messages Can Cause a Crash of Quagga ospfd****The ospfd implementation of OSPF in Quagga allows a remote attacker (on a local network segment with OSPF enabled) to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) with a malformed OSPF Network-LSA message.**Program Impacted: Quagga (ospfd)**Description:**OSPFv2 implementation in Quagga version 0.99.20 and before does not perform a proper length check of the Network-LSA structures contained in an LS-Update OSPF packet. When an otherwise correct LS-Update OSPF packet contains a Network-LSA structure, which has its "Length" header field set to value bigger than the actual number of bytes in the buffer, a buffer overflow happens. This immediately leads to a crash of OSPF protocol process and subsequent disruption of IPv4 routing.**Like many other OSPF cases, exploiting this vulnerability requires an ability to form an OSPF adjacency with the attacked OSPF router and initiate a database exchange process with it. Usual OSPF security precautions (including MD5 authentication) may lower the risk of such event. Upgrading to a patched version of Quagga is recommended regardless of any other measures taken.****CVE-2012-0255: Error in BGP OPEN Message parsing Can Cause a Crash of Quagga bgpd****The bgpd implementation of BGP in Quagga up to (and including) 0.99.20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon aborts due to an assert) via BGP Open message with an invalid AS4 capability.**Program Impacted: Quagga (bgpd)**Description:**BGP implementation in Quagga version 0.99.20 and before contains an error in processing malformed AS4 capability in the BGP OPEN message which leads to a abort (daemon aborts due to an assert) of the BGP protocol process and subsequent disruption of IP routing. When an OPEN with a malformed AS4 capability message is detected, the code fails to flush the message buffers for the peer. When the peer next connects and sends a message, the code will attempt to parse the stale, half-consumed data in the message buffer as it were a fresh BGP message. This leads to an assert and exit of the BGP daemon in the BGP OPEN message parsing code.**The vulnerability is not restricted to BGP neighbors with 4-byte AS but can only be done from any configured peers (or sources spoofing the IP of a configured peer). The potential exists for this condition to be intentionally triggered, resulting in effective denial of service by crashing the BGPd. Usual BGP security precautions (including BGP MD5 authentication) may lower the risk of such event.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Upgrade to [Quagga 0.99.20.1](http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/quagga/) either through the GIT master version or by applying a patch. |
| --- |

| For CVE-2012-0255, the following workaround exists: Shutdown sessions to any peers you can not trust, or where you can not ensure the security of the control-plane. |
