## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=715319#c0)• 13 years ago |
|  | |

Since this seems to be the same kind of issues as [bug 690225](/show_bug.cgi?id=690225 "VERIFIED FIXED - Universal XSS likely with MultiByte charset (e.g. japanese sites)") marking it security sensitive for now.
In euc-jp 0x8F "eats" the next two octets.
In hz-gb-2312 anything above 0x7E will eat the next octet. (Every other implementation of hz-gb-2312 I have seen just replaces each octet above 0x7E with U+FFFD by the way.)
I have not really done extensive research, but I suspect there is more.

This would not be a problem unless lead bytes "eat" any ASCII characters (<= 0x7F).
Or do you have any concrete exploits?

Yes, they eat regardless of what the next octet is, which includes "illegal" octets in the range 0x00 to 0x7E.

Would be nice to get this fixed for Fx 10 so the first ESR isn't affected.

I investigated other encodings. The results that I found is the following:
hz-gb-2312: [0x80-0xFF] eat the next octet.
T.61-8bit: [0xC0-0xCF] eat the next octet.
GB2312/gbk/gb18030: [0x81-0xFE]+[0x30-0x39] eat the next two octets.

Not quite accurate: IE decodes 8-bit data in GB mode but not in ASCII mode.

This makes us compatible with IE on <http://coq.no/X/charset5/test-HZ.php?HZ-GB-2312> and I think solves the over-consuming ASCII issue.
More patches to come for the other encodings

Per RFC 1843, '~\n' looks to be valid line continuation only in ASCII mode.
Is this simulating other existing implementation?

I don't follow this: as far as I can tell they only eat the next octet when it makes up a defined double-byte sequence. See <http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/OBSOLETE/EASTASIA/KSC/JOHAB.TXT> for reference.

Don't resync if the src sequence is 84 31 A4 37 (Yes, GB18030 can represent any Unicode code points except isolated surrogate).
Moreover, why do you scan the ascii byte? aSrc[1] will always be ascii (0x30 to 0x39) because it passed LEGAL\_GBK\_4BYTE\_SECOND\_BYTE() test.

I thought x-johab can eat any bytes. But in fact can't. You are right - this is the correct behavior. And I noticed x-johab also has risk of [bug 703868](/show_bug.cgi?id=703868 "NEW").

Ha ha ha, great catch! (But I think there is actually a bug in the converter, because [bug 174351](/show_bug.cgi?id=174351 "RESOLVED FIXED - Encoding errors aren't treated as fatal XML errors") didn't touch nsGBKToUnicode). New patch coming up

I don't think so. It seems from <http://coq.no/character-tables/misc/en> that there is no interoperable implementation, and I doubt that it is actually used in web content. However, I see from comments in other bugs that it may be used by LDAP, so I've marked it with .isXSSVulnerable rather than removing the decoder completely

Is resync required if the sequence is in the valid 4 bytes range (that is, [0x81-0xfe][0x30-0x39][0x81-0xfe][0x30-0x39])? I doubt it is actually exploitable because only digits are possible ascii characters.
Futhermore, It doesn't match other browsers' behavior.

I prefer the IE behaviour, but I don't have access to IE for testing right now. Chrome's behaviour is very different from ours after resynchronizing, because their handling of characters outside the GR range is very different from ours in general. For example, they decode data:text/html;charset=euc-jp,%8f%81%82 and data:text/html;charset=euc-jp,%81%82 both as U+0081 U+0082, while we decode the first as U+FFFD and the second as U+FFFD U+FFFD.
Another case: Chrome decodes data:text/html;charset=euc-jp,%8f%8e%c1 as U+FF81, while we decode it as U+FFFD. I think both are wrong, and the preferred behaviour would be to decode to U+FFFD U+FF81.
How does IE handle these cases?Version: unspecified → Trunk

Hm, the current Encoding Standard draft has a different algorithm from any existing implementations.
0x8E or 0x8F will disappear if the following byte is neither valid nor ASCII.
For the byte sequence 0x8F 0x8E 0xC1:
0x8F: Increment the byte pointer (Step 6) and set euc-jp first to 0x8F (Step 12).
0x8E: Increment the byte pointer (Step 6) and set euc-jp first to 0x8E (Step 12).
0xC1: Increment the byte pointer (Step 6) and emit U+FE81 (Step 8).
For the byte sequence 0x8F 0x81 0x82:
0x8F: Increment the byte pointer (Step 6) and set euc-jp first to 0x8F (Step 12).
0x81: Increment the byte pointer (Step 6) and emit U+FFFD (Step 14).
0x82: Increment the byte pointer (Step 6) and emit U+FFFD (Step 14).
But it will not eat ASCII chars. For the byte sequence 0x8F 0x22:
0x8F: Increment the byte pointer (Step 6) and set euc-jp first to 0x8F (Step 12).
0x22: Set euc-jp first to 0x00 and emit U+FFFD (Step 4, note that the byte pointer will not be increased).
0x22: Emit U+0022 (Step 4, reading the second byte again because the byte pointer has not been increased).
Anne, what do you think?
I think this is OK because eating non-ASCII chars will not be exploitable.

I think step 12 should also check that euc-jp first is 0x00.

I rewrote parts of the euc-jp algorithm. Hopefully it's more sensible now.

So are Anne's algorithm, IE's implementation and my patch interoperable? Because of the changes, it's impossible to follow [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=715319#c36 "VERIFIED FIXED - More multi-octet encoding issues") now.Target Milestone: --- → mozilla13

I think so. The current specification only consumes bytes in valid ranges. If a byte at any point in a multi-byte sequence is out of range, the lead byte is replaced and all the bytes following it are reinterpreted. (The iso-2022-\* encodings are treated somewhat differently to this. There is no backtracking once you enter double-byte mode there.)

For the byte sequence 8F C1 8E C1:
8F: Increment the byte pointer (Step 5) and set euc-jp first to 0x8F (Step 11).
C1: Increment the byte pointer (Step 5), set euc-jp first to 0x00, and euc-jp second to 0xC1 (Step 8).
8E: Increment the byte pointer (Step 5), let lead be 0xC1 and set euc-jp second to 0x00 (Step 6).
Decrement the byte pointer (Step 6.4) and emit U+FFFD (Step 6.5).
8E: Increment the byte pointer (Step 5) and set euc-jp first to 0x8E (Step 11).
C1: Increment the byte pointer (Step 5) and emit U+FF81 (Step 7).
But IE emits U+FFFD U+FFFD U+FF81. So this algorithm is not interoperable to IE's implementation yet.
That said, I'm no longer sure simulating IE's behavior is a good thing. It is inconsistent with ISO-2022-JP decoder and UTF-8 decoder.

Also, IE swallows the incomplete byte(s) before EOF.

What the current patch behavior? I haven't test the current patch yet.
I found yet another discrepancy. For the byte sequence 8E E0 A1 A2 A1 A2,
IE and the latest spec: U+FFFD U+71F9 U+25C6
Chrome: U+00A2 U+3001 U+3001
Firefox 11: U+FFFD U+3001 U+3001
We are right here because E0-FE is considered a valid but undefined code range.
I withdraw [comment 32](/show_bug.cgi?id=715319#c32 "VERIFIED FIXED - More multi-octet encoding issues") because existing implementations are too peculiar.

The latest spec and Gecko agree on 8E E0 actually (if no match in step 7 it will always go through substeps of 9 and since E0 is in the valid range the byte pointer is not decreased). I should probably change the spec for 8F though to decrease the byte pointer by 2. Thanks for the review!

Apart from the last one, I'm not sure we can call this verified fixed. Simon, please advise.

GB2312 testcase
Sorry, I forgot that <meta charset> doesn't override the Content-type header that bugzilla automatically sets. Can you retest?

Yup, that testcase works as expected now. Tested in Firefox 12.0, 13.0, 14.0a2, and 10.0.5esr.
Marking this verified -- please let me know if there is something more to test here.
Thanks

Guys!
The situation with this bug is similar to [bug #690225](/show_bug.cgi?id=690225 "VERIFIED FIXED - Universal XSS likely with MultiByte charset (e.g. japanese sites)"). In both these Bugzilla entries there is information concerning the holes, which I've informed Mozilla already in March 2009. And that time Mozilla ignored my letter and left Internet users with risk of XSS attacks. And fixed these vulnerabilities only now.
It's good that they were fixed at last - partly after 2,5 years and partly after 3 years after my informing of Mozilla. I've wrote about it in [bug #715319](/show_bug.cgi?id=715319 "VERIFIED FIXED - More multi-octet encoding issues").

Depends on: [CVE-2012-4207](/show_bug.cgi?id=801681 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"~\" eats a char near chunk delimiter in HZ-GB-2312 encoding")
You need to [log in](/show_bug.cgi?id=715319&GoAheadAndLogIn=1)
