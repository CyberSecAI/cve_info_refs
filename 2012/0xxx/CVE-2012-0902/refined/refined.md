{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `/cgi-bin/loader` CGI script allows a remote attacker to reboot the device via a simple GET request without any authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Lack of authentication for reboot functionality.",
        "Exposure of reboot functionality through a simple GET request."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Denial of Service (DoS) by forcing the device to reboot.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a GET request to `http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/cgi-bin/loader`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device."
