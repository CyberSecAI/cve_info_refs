# USN-1366-1: devscripts vulnerabilities

15 February 2012

debdiff, a part of devscripts, could be made to run programs as your login if
it opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [devscripts](/security/cves?package=devscripts) - Scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier

## Details

Paul Wise discovered that debdiff did not properly sanitize its input when

processing .dsc and .changes files. If debdiff processed a crafted file, an

attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-0210](/security/CVE-2012-0210))

Raphael Geissert discovered that debdiff did not properly sanitize its input

when processing source packages. If debdiff processed an original source

tarball, with crafted filenames in the top-level directory, an attacker could

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-0211](/security/CVE-2012-0211))

Raphael Geissert discovered that debdiff did not properly sanitize its input

when processing filename parameters. If debdiff processed a crafted filename

parameter, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-0212](/security/CVE-2012-0212))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: yes
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0210 CVE-2012-0211 CVE-2012-0212

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in debdiff, a script used
to compare two Debian packages, which is part of the devscripts package.
The following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ids have been
assigned to identify them:

CVE-2012-0210:

    Paul Wise discovered that due to insufficient input sanitising when
    processing .dsc and .changes files, it is possible to execute
    arbitrary code and disclose system information.

CVE-2012-0211:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that it is possible to inject or modify
    arguments of external commands when processing source packages with
    specially-named tarballs in the top-level directory of the .orig
    tarball, allowing arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2012-0212:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that it is possible to inject or modify
    arguments of external commands when passing as argument to debdiff
    a specially-named file, allowing arbitrary code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.10.69+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.11.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your devscripts packages.
