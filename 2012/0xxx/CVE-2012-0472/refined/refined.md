Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-0472:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the `cairo_dwrite_font_face` component when hardware acceleration is disabled or when using incompatible video drivers on Windows Vista and Windows 7.
- Specifically, the issue occurs when the system attempts to render fonts using the cairo-dwrite path, which is not designed for this particular scenario.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect code path:**  The cairo-dwrite code path is incorrectly invoked in situations where it should not be used, leading to an error state.
- **Error state not handled properly:** When a cairo font enters an error state, subsequent attempts to use it lead to a crash. The fix implemented a check to prevent this.
- **Memory Corruption:** The cairo-dwrite code path, when improperly used, corrupts memory, specifically in the `_cairo_dwrite_font_face_scaled_font_create` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of the application. The content mentions a read access violation, which may be an indicator for an attempt to dereference an invalid memory address.
- **Potential arbitrary code execution:**  While the immediate crash was due to a read access violation, the vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution depending on how memory is corrupted. 

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web page loading:** An attacker could create a malicious web page that exploits the vulnerability. This is done by forcing the use of a stroke based font like 'Roman' at a large size (> 256px) when hardware acceleration is disabled.
- **User interaction:**  The user has to visit the malicious page with a vulnerable configuration (Windows Vista or 7, hardware acceleration off).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** An attacker can be located anywhere with the ability to host a malicious webpage.
- **Limited user configuration knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be aware of the conditions under which the vulnerability becomes exploitable (hardware acceleration disabled).

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by **wushi** of team509 and reported by **iDefense**.
- The bug report includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) HTML file that triggers the crash.
- The bug was addressed by implementing a check in the code to bail out of text shaping process in the event of `SetupCairoFont` failing.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 12, Firefox ESR 10.0.4, SeaMonkey 2.9, Thunderbird 12, and Thunderbird ESR 10.0.4.
- The vulnerability is considered a security-critical defect.
