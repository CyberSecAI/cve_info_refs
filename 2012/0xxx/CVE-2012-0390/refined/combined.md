An update that solves 9 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
The GnuTLS library received a critical security fix and
other updates:
\* CVE-2014-0092: The X.509 certificate verification had
incorrect error handling, which could lead to broken
certificates marked as being valid.
\* CVE-2009-5138: A verification problem in handling V1
certificates could also lead to V1 certificates incorrectly
being handled.
\* CVE-2013-2116: The \_gnutls\_ciphertext2compressed
function in lib/gnutls\_cipher.c in GnuTLS allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read
and crash) via a crafted padding length.
\* CVE-2013-1619: The TLS implementation in GnuTLS did
not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a
noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of
malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to
conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery
attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted
packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169. (Lucky13)
\* CVE-2012-1569: The asn1\_get\_length\_der function in
decoding.c in GNU Libtasn1 , as used in GnuTLS did not
properly handle certain large length values, which allowed
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory
corruption and application crash) or possibly have
unspecified other impact via a crafted ASN.1 structure.
\* CVE-2012-1573: gnutls\_cipher.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS
did not properly handle data encrypted with a block cipher,
which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(heap memory corruption and application crash) via a
crafted record, as demonstrated by a crafted
GenericBlockCipher structure.
\* CVE-2012-0390: The DTLS implementation in GnuTLS
executed certain error-handling code only if there is a
specific relationship between a padding length and the
ciphertext size, which made it easier for remote attackers
to recover partial plaintext via a timing side-channel
attack, a related issue to CVE-2011-4108.
Also some non security bugs have been fixed:
\* Did some more s390x size\_t vs int fixes. (bnc#536809,
bnc#659128)
\* re-enabled "legacy negotiation" (bnc#554084)
\* fix safe-renegotiation for sle10sp3 and sle10sp4 bug
(bnc#554084)
\* fix bug bnc#536809, fix gnutls-cli to abort
connection after detecting a bad certificate

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
