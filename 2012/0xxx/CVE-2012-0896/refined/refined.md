**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- **Arbitrary File Download:** The `download.php` script in the Count per Day WordPress plugin was vulnerable to arbitrary file download due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could manipulate the `f` parameter to specify a path to any file on the server, which the script would then attempt to serve for download.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `map/map.php` and `map/settings.xml.php` scripts were vulnerable to non-persistent XSS because they did not properly sanitize user-supplied input from the `map` parameter. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page. Additionally the `map/data.xml.php` was vulnerable because it didn't sanitize input from the `map` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Arbitrary file download:** The `download.php` script directly uses user-provided input from the `f` parameter to construct a file path without proper validation and sanitization.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `map.php`, `settings.xml.php` and `data.xml.php` scripts did not sanitize user-supplied input from the `map` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious script.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker could potentially download sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files, database dumps, or other application source code, depending on the server's file permissions and the web server's user's access privileges.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript that could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Execution of actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Arbitrary File Download:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/download.php` script, with the vulnerable `f` parameter pointing to the file the attacker wishes to download.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to `/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/map/map.php` , `/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/map/settings.xml.php` or `/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/map/data.xml.php` with the `map` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
-   For arbitrary file download, the attacker needs to know or guess the path of the target file.
-   For XSS, the attacker needs to craft a malicious link that, when accessed by a victim, executes the injected JavaScript.
