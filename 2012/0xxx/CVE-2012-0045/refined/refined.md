{
  "CVE-2012-0045": {
    "Description": "The Linux kernel, when used in conjunction with KVM, does not properly handle the syscall instruction for 32-bit guests on Intel CPUs within non-longmodes and on some AMD CPUs within legacy mode, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) by executing this instruction, because the target registers (STAR, LSTAR, CSTAR) remain NULL.",
    "Root cause": "The syscall instruction (0f05) was not properly handled by KVM for 32-bit guests in non-long modes on Intel CPUs and legacy modes on some AMD CPUs. This caused a missing \"invalid opcode\" trap (int 6).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing check for the validity of the syscall instruction in certain CPU modes and architectures.",
      "Lack of proper emulation of the syscall instruction's behavior on affected CPUs."
    ],
    "Impact": "A guest OS user can cause a denial of service by triggering a guest OS crash.",
     "Attack vectors": "A malicious user inside a KVM guest OS can execute a syscall instruction, triggering the vulnerability.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to execute code within the guest OS. No special privileges within the guest are needed to trigger the vulnerability."
