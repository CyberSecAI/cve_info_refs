Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `unity-firefox-extension` exposed a `toDataURL()` function to the web which allowed conversion of an image (specified by a URL) to a data URI. This function bypassed same-origin policy checks due to the canvas being created in a privileged chrome context, allowing retrieval of data from cross-origin URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The `toDataURL()` function within the Firefox extension did not properly enforce the same-origin policy, allowing a malicious website to fetch data from other domains.
- **Privileged Context:** The canvas element used for the image conversion was created in a chrome context which bypasses normal browser security restrictions.
- **Unsafe API Exposure:** Exposing the `toDataURL()` functionality to the web made this bypass exploitable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could use this to steal sensitive data by reading images from domains they should not have access to. This could include session data, cookies, or any other data rendered as an image.
- **Security-Sensitive Operations:** By gaining the ability to access cross-origin resources, attackers could potentially perform other security-sensitive operations based on the data retrieved.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** A user is tricked into visiting a malicious web page that exploits the vulnerable `toDataURL()` function.
- **Cross-Origin Image Loading:** The malicious web page uses the exposed `toDataURL()` to load an image from a different origin than the malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker must be able to host or inject malicious HTML/Javascript content onto a web page or website visited by the victim.
- **Target User's Browser:** The target user must be using the vulnerable Firefox extension with the affected browser version.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Packages**: `unity-firefox-extension` , and webapps-applications (which utilized this functionality)
- **Affected Ubuntu Release**: Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal) was specifically mentioned, but other releases might have been affected as well.
- **Fix:** The fix consisted of removing the vulnerable `toDataURL()` functionality and modifying the webapps to avoid using this API and instead directly load the image.
- **Workaround:** There was no workaround other than disabling the `unity-firefox-extension`.
