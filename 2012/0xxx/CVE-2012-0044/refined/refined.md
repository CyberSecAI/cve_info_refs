  "CVE-2012-0044": {
    "description": "There is a potential integer overflow in drm_mode_dirtyfb_ioctl() if userspace passes in a large num_clips. The call to kmalloc would allocate a small buffer, and the call to fb->funcs->dirty may result in a memory corruption.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the drm_mode_dirtyfb_ioctl() function within the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem when handling a large number of clips.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Memory Corruption"
      ],
       "impact": "A local unprivileged user could potentially trigger a memory corruption leading to a system crash.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access by a user",
        "Through the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) interface"

        "Ability to execute code with read/write access to the Direct Rendering Interface (DRI) path (typically within the 'video' group) or X server"
