{
  "CVE-2012-0866": {
    "Root cause": "The CREATE TRIGGER command did not perform a permissions check on the trigger function to be called.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing permissions check"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated database user could call a privileged trigger function on data of their choosing, potentially leading to privilege escalation if the trigger function was marked SECURITY DEFINER.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Database connection",
      "CREATE TRIGGER command"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An authenticated database user with the ability to create triggers on tables they own."
  }
}
