Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0859:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided text includes the following, which directly corresponds to CVE-2012-0859:

> It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed Vorbis files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Vorbis file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-0859](/security/CVE-2012-0859))

> Please use CVE-2012-0859 for this issue.

This confirms that the content is relevant to CVE-2012-0859.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The root cause is an **incorrect handling of malformed Vorbis files** within FFmpeg. This is a vulnerability within the Vorbis decoder.
*   Specifically, it was a "forgotten case" in the original patchset for CVE-2011-3893 related to how the multiplier is handled, and a missing check resulting from a previous fix.
*   The root cause is further clarified in the email from Kurt Seifried, detailing that "This fixes a apparently forgoten case in the original patchset from google Ive reproduced this by setting multiplier to the maximal value that it could reach"

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   The primary vulnerability is an **improper handling of malformed data** within the Vorbis decoding process. This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger an application crash by providing a specially crafted Vorbis file.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** There's a possibility that the vulnerability could be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the FFmpeg application.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   The primary attack vector is through **trickery**. The attacker must trick a user into opening a specially crafted Vorbis file using FFmpeg.
    
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply the victim with a malicious file. The attacker can be local, or can leverage remote delivery of the malicious file via web, email, or other means.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges or elevated access to the system; the attack executes with the permissions of the user who opens the malicious file.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided information indicates that CVE-2012-0859 is related to a "forgotten case" in the original patchset for CVE-2011-3893, demonstrating how incomplete patching can lead to further vulnerabilities.
* The email from Kurt Seifried provides detail on the root cause which includes the information that the vulnerability "fixes a apparently forgoten case in the original patchset from google" and the specific case that was missed "Ive reproduced this by setting multiplier to the maximal value that it could reach". This shows the direct method used to trigger the vulnerability, providing better understanding of its mechanics.

**Summary**
CVE-2012-0859 is a vulnerability in FFmpeg related to the incorrect handling of crafted Vorbis files. An attacker can exploit it by tricking a user into opening a malformed file leading to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution. The root cause was a previously missed check in the Vorbis decoder fix for CVE-2011-3893.
