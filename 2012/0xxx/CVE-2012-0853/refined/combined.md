## Details

Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly

handled certain malformed DV files. If a user were tricked into opening a

crafted DV file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-3929](/security/CVE-2011-3929), [CVE-2011-3936](/security/CVE-2011-3936))

Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly

handled certain malformed NSV files. If a user were tricked into opening a

crafted NSV file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-3940](/security/CVE-2011-3940))

Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly

handled certain malformed MJPEG-B files. If a user were tricked into

opening a crafted MJPEG-B file, an attacker could cause a denial of service

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-3947](/security/CVE-2011-3947))

Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly

handled certain malformed DPCM files. If a user were tricked into opening a

of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-3951](/security/CVE-2011-3951))

Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly

handled certain malformed KMVC files. If a user were tricked into opening a

crafted KMVC file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-3952](/security/CVE-2011-3952))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed H.264

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted H.264 file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-0851](/security/CVE-2012-0851))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed ADPCM

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted ADPCM file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-0852](/security/CVE-2012-0852))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed Atrac 3

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Atrac 3 file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-0853](/security/CVE-2012-0853))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed Shorten

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Shorten file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-0858](/security/CVE-2012-0858))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed Vorbis

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Vorbis file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-0859](/security/CVE-2012-0859))

Fabian Yamaguchi discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain

malformed VQA files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted VQA

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2012-0947](/security/CVE-2012-0947))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libavformat52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ffmpeg)
  -
  [4:0.5.9-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ffmpeg/4%3A0.5.9-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [libavcodec52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ffmpeg)
  -
  [4:0.5.9-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ffmpeg/4%3A0.5.9-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

This update uses a new upstream release of Libav, which includes additional

bug fixes. In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary

changes.
