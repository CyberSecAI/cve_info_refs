```
The introduction of XKB debugging functions in the following commit:
| commit 7d2543a3cb3089241982ce4f8984fd723d5312a1
| Author: Daniel Stone <[daniel at fooishbar.org](http://lists.x.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg-devel)>
| Date:   Wed Dec 29 12:03:01 2010 +0000
|
|     XKB: Add debug key actions for grabs & window tree

leads to the ability of bypassing X screen locking programs with key
combinations like: Ctrl+Alt+KP_Multiply (Multiply key on the numpad).

As a quick workaround, stop calling UngrabAllDevices().

On a side note, it doesn't seem to care much about its kill_client
parameter, which is only used to decide which message should be
ErrorF()'d.

This is a candidate for the 1.11 branch.

FWIW in Debian, I chose to revert the commit entirely until the proper
course of action is discussed here. I checked this patch on top of
1.11.3.901 though.

In Cc, Daniel and Peter for their tags on the commit, and Jeremy for
an advanced notice for 1.11.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-19 06:13:45 UTC  ``` It was found that XKB actions for debugging X.org clients were enabled by default. This could cause a screen locking application such as gnome-screensaver to be killed when those key combinations were triggered.  The debugging key actions were introduced in the following commit: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/commit/?id=7d2543a3cb3089241982ce4f8984fd723d5312a1>  Reference: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/6725>  Mitigation: [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/6725/focus=6731](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/6725/focus%3D6731)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-19 06:19:07 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of xkeyboard-config as shipped with Fedora 16.  This issue does not affect the version of xkeyboard-config as shipped with Fedora 15, since the version of Xorg-x11-server does not have the relevant code to trigger the flaw.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-19 06:30:55 UTC  ``` Created xkeyboard-config tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-16 [[bug 783044](show_bug.cgi?id=783044 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-0064 xkeyboard-config: screen-saver unlock via xkb debug key actions [fedora-16]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-19 07:32:53 UTC  ``` Xorg supports use of the Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Multiply key sequence to kill clients with an active keyboard or mouse grab as well as killing any application that may have locked the server. This is disabled by default and can be enabled by adding the following line to xorg.conf:  Option "AllowClosedownGrabs" "on"  However the disabled grab support was removed in the server 1.4 development cycle. since then, the xorg.conf option had no effect (though the man page entry was removed later in the 1.6 cycle). it was re-introduced in the 1.11 development cycle, so the first version affected is 1.11.1 (Fedora-16)  In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 the above mentioned xorg.conf configuration directive is disabled by default, which prevents occurrence of this flaw and allows to enable this behaviour only in cases, where it is desired. The version of Xorg shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected, because the relevant code is missing.  This issue was fixed in Fedora by removing the relevant portion of the keyboard mapping from the xfree86 config file.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c5)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-19 07:58:23 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the version of xorg-x11 and xkeyboard-config in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 respectively.  This issue did NOT affect the version of xkeyboard-config in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-19 17:16:43 UTC  ```  Statement:   Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect versions of xorg-x11 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4. This issue did not affect versions of xkeyboard-config as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c7)  Fedora Update System    2012-01-19 22:01:28 UTC  ``` xkeyboard-config-2.3-3.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c8)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-19 23:03:11 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 783261](show_bug.cgi?id=783261 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Xorg-x11 1.11 screen saver work around") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c11)  Dave Airlie    2012-01-20 09:36:52 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 783382](show_bug.cgi?id=783382 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Screen locking vulnerable") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c13)  Vegard Lima    2012-01-26 08:08:44 UTC  ``` Was this supposed to fix this issue:  $ rpm -q xkeyboard-config xkeyboard-config-2.3-3.fc16.noarch $ qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock  Pressing Control+Alt+KeypadMultiply unlocks the screen.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c14)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-26 08:17:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c13)) > Was this supposed to fix this issue: >  > $ rpm -q xkeyboard-config > xkeyboard-config-2.3-3.fc16.noarch > $ qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock >  > Pressing Control+Alt+KeypadMultiply unlocks the screen.  Did you re-start X after installing the updates?   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c15)  Vegard Lima    2012-01-26 08:31:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c14)) > (In reply to [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c13)) > > Was this supposed to fix this issue: > >  > > $ rpm -q xkeyboard-config > > xkeyboard-config-2.3-3.fc16.noarch > > $ qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock > >  > > Pressing Control+Alt+KeypadMultiply unlocks the screen. >  > Did you re-start X after installing the updates?  Yes, X was restarted. Whole machine rebooted in fact.  I forgot to mention I'm using KDE.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c16)  Peter Hutterer    2012-01-26 22:27:08 UTC  ``` Vegard, I need the output of "xkbcomp -xkb :0 -", your xorg.conf (if any) and whatever KDE settings you have configured for your keyboard.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c17)  Vegard Lima    2012-01-27 06:23:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=783039#c16)) > Vegard, I need the output of "xkbcomp -xkb :0 -", your xorg.conf (if any) and > whatever KDE settings you have configured for your keyboard.  Aha! I was using and old xkb dump to switch "¤" and "$" on my keyboard. My mistake. Terribly sorry for the noise.   ``` |  |

Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2006-September/000128.html) for more information. Patches are available for [6.8.2](../../Releases/6.8.2/), [6.9.0](../../Releases/6.9/), [7.0](../../Releases/7.0/) and [7.1](../../Releases/7.1/).

## X.Org 6.9.0/7.0

* June 20, 2006 - A lack of checks for setuid() failures when invoked by a privileged process (e.g., X server, xdm, xterm, if installed setuid or setgid) may cause the process to execute certain privileged operations (file access) as root while it was intended to be executed with a less privileged effective user ID, on systems where setuid() called by root can fail. This can be used by a malicious local user to overwrite files and possibly elevate privileges in some corner cases. Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-announce/2006-June/000100.html) for more information. Patches are available for [6.8.2](../../Releases/6.8.2/), [6.9.0](../../Releases/6.9/), [7.0](../../Releases/7.0/) and [7.1](../../Releases/7.1/).
* May 2, 2006 - A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server as shipped with X11R6.8.x, X11R6.9.0 and X11R7.0 (xorg-server 1.0.x) -- this is [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526). Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute malicious code within the X server. Please see [the advisory](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg/2006-May/015136.html) for more information. Patches are available for [6.8.2](../../Releases/6.8.2/), [6.9.0](../../Releases/6.9/) and [7.0](../../Releases/7.0/).

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

```
Because of the high visibility security issue, xkeyboard-config
release happened 12 days earlier than expected.

In total, 15 bugs were fixes, some translations updated.

My apologies to the Translation Project, the translations that were
not submitted by today will be merged to git anyway.
