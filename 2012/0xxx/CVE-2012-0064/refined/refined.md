Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-0064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the introduction of XKB debugging functions in the X server. Specifically, a commit added debug key actions that allowed certain key combinations to bypass screen locking programs by calling `UngrabAllDevices()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unintended Functionality:** The debugging key actions, specifically Ctrl+Alt+KP_Multiply, were enabled by default and could be used to kill clients with an active keyboard or mouse grab. This was not intended for normal usage and created a security risk.
- **Lack of Access Control:** There was no mechanism to control or disable the `UngrabAllDevices()` functionality, making it universally accessible through the debug key combinations.
- **Bypass of Screen Locks:** The debug action bypassed screen locking mechanisms, leaving systems vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Screen Lock Bypass:** An attacker could bypass screen locking programs, such as gnome-screensaver, kscreenlocker, slock, and slimlock.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful bypass could lead to unauthorized access to the system and user session.
- **Denial of Service (indirect):** By killing the screen locker, an attacker could render the security feature ineffective, effectively denying service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Keyboard Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific key combinations, primarily Ctrl+Alt+KP_Multiply.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have physical or remote keyboard access to the system running a vulnerable X server to input the specific key combinations.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the specific key combination to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Xorg server version 1.11 and later.
- The fix involves disabling the `UngrabAllDevices()` call for the debug key actions, or removing the keyboard mapping, which prevents the screen lock bypass.
- The vulnerability was addressed in `xkeyboard-config 2.5`.
- Red Hat stated the issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.
- The fix requires restarting X after installing updates.
