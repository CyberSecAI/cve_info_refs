{
  "CVE-2012-0874": {
    "Description": "The JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet invoker servlets allow unauthenticated access by default in some profiles. The security interceptor's second layer of authentication prevented direct exploitation of this flaw. If the interceptor was misconfigured or inadvertently disabled, this flaw could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the JBoss server.",
    "Root cause": "The JMXInvokerHAServlet and EJBInvokerHAServlet servlets are exposed without requiring authentication by default in some JBoss profiles. The issue could be directly exploited if the security interceptor was disabled or misconfigured.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated access to invoker servlets",
      "Reliance on a security interceptor which can be disabled or misconfigured"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the JBoss server",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote network access",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Network access to vulnerable JBoss server; ability to send HTTP requests"
  }
