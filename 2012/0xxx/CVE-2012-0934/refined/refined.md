Based on the provided information, the following can be determined:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was related to an unauthenticated AJAX call in the `savetag.php` file. The original code directly included `wp-blog-header.php` based on user-supplied input (`$_POST['tt-abspath']`). This allowed a user to potentially include arbitrary php files from the server, leading to remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated AJAX call: The `savetag.php` script could be accessed without any authentication checks.
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The code was vulnerable to RFI via the `require()` function using a user-controlled path.
- Lack of input validation: There is no input validation on the `$_POST['tt-abspath']` variable in `savetag.php` before it is used within the require statement.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by including a malicious file, leading to complete compromise of the web server.
- Data exfiltration: An attacker may be able to read sensitive files or configuration data from the server.
- Denial of Service: An attacker could use the vulnerability to crash the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/wp-content/plugins/theme-tuner/ajax/savetag.php` with `tt-abspath` parameter containing a malicious php file path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `savetag.php` file.
- The attacker does not need any authentication or login credentials to the Wordpress site.
- The attacker needs to know the absolute server path to the php file they wish to have included.

**Additional Notes:**

- The changes in the provided changeset address this vulnerability by removing the direct `require()` with user input.
- The fix removes the line `require($_POST['tt-abspath'].'/wp-blog-header.php');` and the `savetag.php` script no longer needs `$_POST['tt-abspath']`.
- The modified `index.php` file now includes a check for `$_REQUEST['tt-page']` to route the `savetag.php` request and does not rely on the `$_POST['tt-abspath']`.
- The changelog in the `readme.txt` notes "Fixed security issue" for version 0.8 which is when this fix was implemented.
