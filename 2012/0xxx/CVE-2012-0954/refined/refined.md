{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "APT did not properly validate imported keyrings via `apt-key net-update` due to reliance on GnuPG argument order and a lack of checking of GPG subkeys when validating keyrings.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient verification of GPG keyrings",
      "Reliance on GnuPG argument order"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker performing a machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack could potentially install altered packages.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Machine-in-the-middle attack",
       "Manipulating the order of keyrings during verification"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to perform a MITM attack",
      "Ability to create a malicious keyring with colliding subkeys"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was initially addressed by USN-1475-1, but this fix was insufficient. Subsequent attacks revealed a way to circumvent the fix using key collisions. The ultimate fix involved disabling the `apt-key net-update` option completely, with plans to re-enable it with corrected verification in the future. The vulnerability is also related to CVE-2011-3368."
