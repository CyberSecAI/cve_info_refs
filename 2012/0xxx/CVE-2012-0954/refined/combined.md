# USN-1477-1: APT vulnerability

15 June 2012

An attacker could trick APT into installing altered packages.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [apt](/security/cves?package=apt) - Advanced front-end for dpkg

## Details

Georgi Guninski discovered that APT did not properly validate imported

keyrings via apt-key net-update. USN-1475-1 added additional verification

for imported keyrings, but it was insufficient. If a remote attacker were

able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be

used to install altered packages. This update corrects the issue by

disabling the net-update option completely. A future update will re-enable

the option with corrected verification.

# ubuntu apt-key (part 3)

```
ubuntu apt-key (part 3)

On fully patched as of Fri Jun 15 12:33:01 EEST ubuntu 10.4
apt-key allows installing malicious trusted gpg keys using
minor abuse.

Attached is pe2, either MITM apt-key or change ARCHIVE_KEYRING_URI
in it, then do 'apt-key net-update' or wait cron to do it for you.

The poc needs some polishing on purpose.

OFFTOPIC: Someone is selling solution/keys/dev tools for this bug,
for inquiries M8R-pnkrp4 @mailinator.com

### Bug Description

Georgi Guninski reported on <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Jun/267> (slightly modified for language):

"While wasting my time with apt-key noticed strange behaviour with

colliding subkeys.

Out of paranoia ubuntu disallows importing certain trusted keyids.

This is trivial to circumvent by making a collision with subkey.

Attached is a key with subkey keyid colliding with

Ubuntu Archive Master Signing Key <ftpmaster () ubuntu com>.

By emulating apt-key netupdate, noticed that the order of the keyrings

is important. If the master keyring is first, the colliding key with

correct signature fails validation (probably because the other key is used).

If the colliding keyring is first, everything is ok (modulo reporting wrong

signer).

Probably this may lead to gpg abuse.

colliding first:

$gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring /etc/apt/secring.gpg --keyring /tmp/sec1

--keyring /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-master-keyring.gpg --check-sigs

Ok, Michael, Marc and I looked at this a bit. If copy sec1.bin to /var/www/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg then update ARCHIVE\_KEYRING\_URI to have ARCHIVE\_KEYRING\_URI=<http://localhost/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg>, the key does not get updated on lucid/amd64. If I change the order as the report suggests, it is imported. Ie, I use this:

if $GPG\_CMD --keyring $TMP\_KEYRING --keyring $MASTER --check-sigs --with-colons $add\_key | grep '^sig:!:' | cut -d: -f5 | grep -q $master\_key; then

instead of:

if $GPG\_CMD --keyring $MASTER --keyring $TMP\_KEYRING --check-sigs --with-colons $add\_key | grep '^sig:!:' | cut -d: -f5 | grep -q $master\_key; then

At this point it needs to be verified that gpg will never internally reverse the order on all architectures. If it ever does, then this is a problem. If not, this attack would require an additional step (to update apt-key's code to reverse the order).

### Bug Description

Attacks are being performed against the 'apt-key net-update' command and it is not considered secure. While it is in the process of being disabled in Ubuntu, it should be improved to be secure.

I would welcome feedback on the alternative approach. The idea is basicly to simply download a signed keyring file, gpg verify that against the master key and if its good, import it.

As I recall, we didn't go this route the first time around because we wanted to avoid changing the server-side interface. But if trying to check this securely is a case of being nibbled to death by cats, I think it makes sense to revisit this. So I have no objection to using a gpg-verified keyring object here.

I'm fine with the signed-keyring-file approach too, although I haven't confirmed that there are no attacks possible on the code used to verify \*that\* signature.

From #ubuntu-meeting on 2012-09-12:

08:43 < mvo> cjwatson: it will require a server side change

08:43 < mvo> cjwatson: if you guys are happy with the new proposed schema we can

             upload (once the server side is updated)

08:43 < mvo> but I (much) agree we should not rush this :) it caused enough pain

             already :/

08:45 < cjwatson> Of course I can't help with the server side change at the moment

                  because we don't have our sudo access back yet on pepo

08:45 < cjwatson> You'll probably have to ask webops

Thanks Colin, that is great news.

I updated the branch (and also merged the debian-sid changes) into <https://github.com/mvo5/apt/tree/ubuntu/lp1013681> - I need to test it a bit more and then I will upload.

Whilst poking all of this a while back, my thought was to use inline signed keyring snippet which is downloaded probably with the apt-helper, validated (well gpgv decrypt) and stored as /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/netupdate.gpg. Since we no longer need to touch /etc/apt/trusted.gpg keyring. This doesn't even need to live in apt-key netupdate, and could be just a timer unit. But i guess having this simple logic in apt-key script may make sense.

Note that netupdate has been disabled for a long while now, thus any reintroduction will need security team review before we enable.

# Strange gpg key shadowing

---

*From*: Georgi Guninski <guninski () guninski com>

*Date*: Thu, 14 Jun 2012 12:18:26 +0300

---

```
While wasting my time with apt-key noticed strange behaviour with
colliding subkeys.

Out of paranoia ubuntu disallows importing certain trusted keyids.
This is trivial to circumvent by making a collision with subkey.

Attached is a key with subkey keyid colliding with
Ubuntu Archive Master Signing Key <ftpmaster () ubuntu com>.

By emulating apt-key netupdate, noticed that the order of the keyrings
is important. If the master keyring is first, the colliding key with
correct signature fails validation (probably because the other key is used).
If the colliding keyring is first, everything is ok (modulo reporting wrong
signer).

Probably this may lead to gpg abuse.

colliding first:

$gpg --ignore-time-conflict --no-options --no-default-keyring --secret-keyring /etc/apt/secring.gpg --keyring /tmp/sec1
--keyring /usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-master-keyring.gpg  --check-sigs

FYI:

<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Jun/271>

<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Jun/289>

The fix for both of the previous bugs was not enough. There is reportedly an active exploit utilizing the Ubuntu CD Image Automatic Signing Key.

Ok, I am disabling net-update like in <http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1215-1/> until we can get this fixed for real. As discussed in IRC, we'll need to change how we verify via net-update and this is not something we want to rush.

There is chance someone exploits this in apt-key...

Attached is a keyring and here is the output:

# USN-1475-1: APT update

15 June 2012

APT now more thoroughly verifies imported keyrings.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [apt](/security/cves?package=apt) - Advanced front-end for dpkg

## Details

Georgi Guninski discovered that APT relied on GnuPG argument order and did

not check GPG subkeys when validating imported keyrings via apt-key

net-update. While it appears that a machine-in-the-middle attacker cannot

exploit this, as a hardening measure this update adjusts apt-key to

validate all subkeys when checking for key collisions.

##### Ubuntu 8.04

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)

  [0.8.16~exp5ubuntu13.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.8.16~exp5ubuntu13.4)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [0.8.13.2ubuntu4.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.8.13.2ubuntu4.5)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

  -
  [0.7.25.3ubuntu9.12](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.7.25.3ubuntu9.12)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
