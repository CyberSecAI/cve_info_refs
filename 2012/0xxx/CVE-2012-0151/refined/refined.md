Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0151:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an improper validation of the file digest by the Windows Authenticode Signature Verification function, specifically when processing specially crafted Portable Executable (PE) files. This function, also known as WinVerifyTrust, is responsible for verifying the integrity and origin of software binaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Signature Validation:** The core issue is the flawed way the Windows Authenticode Signature Verification function validates the file digest of specially crafted PE files.
*   **Exploitable File Structure:** The vulnerability allows attackers to modify existing signed executable files by adding malicious code in unverified portions of the file without invalidating the digital signature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker gaining remote code execution can take complete control of the targeted system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users logged in with administrative privileges are at greater risk. Although users with fewer rights could also be affected, the impact will be less.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Attack:** Attackers can send emails with specially crafted, signed PE files, and trick users into opening them.
*   **Web-Based Attack:** Attackers can host a website with a malicious PE file. They can also use compromised or user-content hosting websites to deliver the payload.  Attackers then need to convince the user to visit the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Modification:** The attacker needs to be able to craft or modify a signed PE file such that malicious code can be embedded in the unverified portion without invalidating the signature.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user or application to execute the manipulated PE file. The attacker has to rely on social engineering to get the user to open the malicious file or to visit a malicious website.
*   **No Prior Authentication Needed:** The vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous attackers.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly disclosed before the security update.
*   Microsoft was not aware of any exploitation in the wild at the time of the security bulletin release.
*   The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows Authenticode Signature Verification function performs Windows Authenticode signature verification when verifying portable executable files, enforcing strict verification.
*   The Microsoft Exploitability Index assessed this vulnerability as "Exploitation Detected," because, while no exploitation was detected when the security bulletin was originally released, Microsoft was aware of instances where the vulnerability had been exploited after the bulletin was published.
*   Applying the update may cause software's digital signature to be invalid if the PE file contains content that does not conform to the Authenticode specification or if extra content is appended after the signature application.

This vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for remote code execution and full system compromise.
