{
  "CVE-2012-0804": {
    "Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the CVS client handled responses from HTTP proxies. A malicious HTTP proxy could use this flaw to cause the CVS client to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the CVS client.",
    "Root cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `proxy_connect` function within the CVS client. The `sscanf()` function copies data from `read_buf` to `write_buf` without proper bounds checking, leading to a potential overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Inadequate input validation",
      "Lack of bounds checking"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the CVS client. This could lead to system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious HTTP proxy server can send a crafted HTTP response to a CVS client during a proxy connection.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or compromise an HTTP proxy server that a CVS client connects through. The attacker also needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP response that triggers the overflow.",
