Subject: Re: CVE Request -- Asterisk AST-2012-001 / Remote
 DoS while processing crypto line for media stream with non-existing RTP

CVE-2012-0885 was already assigned to AST-2012-001 based on a request from
the upstream vendor.  They probably updated their advisory since your
initial request:

Subject: CVE Request -- Asterisk AST-2012-001 / Remote DoS while processing
 crypto line for media stream with non-existing RTP

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a denial of service flaw was found in the way asterisk processed certain
requests to negotiate secure video stream, when the res_srtp Asterisk module
has been loaded and video support has not been enabled. A remote attacker could
provide a specially-crafted media stream negotiation request, which once
processed by Asterisk would lead to asterisk daemon crash by processing crypto
line for such media stream.

Upstream patch against the v1.10.x branch:

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

I'll try to recompile with the DONT\_OPTIMIZE flag on and add a new backtrace.  ---   By: Walter Doekes (wdoekes) 2012-01-16 02:20:07.959-0600p->rtp shouldn't be null there. Looks like either (a) memory was overwritten or (b) a different thread has been writing to p or (c) some function is in this short bit of code is setting rtp to null there.   If possible please supply the full bt for the other threads and (thread apply all bt) and the incoming SDP message ('sip set debug on') and chan\_sip debugging ('core set debug 5 chan\_sip').   ---   By: Paul Belanger (pabelanger) 2012-01-17 16:24:03.680-0600Thank you for your bug report. In order to move your issue forward, we require a backtrace[1] from the core file produced after the crash. Also, be sure you have DONT\_OPTIMIZE enabled in menuselect within the Compiler Flags section, then:   make install   After enabling, reproduce the crash, and then execute the backtrace[1] instructions. When complete, attach that file to this issue report.

Let me know if you need additional info.   ---   By: Matt Jordan (mjordan) 2012-01-18 15:29:31.628-0600Catalin - the backtrace gives us a good place to work from - but can you also add the SIP trace?  Either with a pcap from wireshark or from Asterisk with sip set debug on?   Thanks, Matt  ---   By: Catalin Sanda (catalin.sanda@gmail.com) 2012-01-18 15:59:04.135-0600Please find attached the debug info.  ---   By: Walter Doekes (wdoekes) 2012-01-19 03:09:58.764-0600Patch issueA19202\_crypto\_if\_uninited\_text\_or\_video.patch should fix crash caused by this simple SDP:   m=(video|text) 12345 RTP/(S)?AVP 97 96  a=crypto:1 AES\_CM\_128\_HMAC\_SHA1\_80 inline:abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789ABCD   Prerequisites:   loaded modules (besides res\_rtp and chan\_sip):  > res\_srtp.so   sip.conf config:  > allowguest=yes (default) OR an authenticated sip user!  > textsupport=no (default) [for the "m=text" crash]  > videosupport=no (default) [for the "m=video" crash]   a couple of possible fixes/workarounds:  > apply patch  > unload res\_srtp  > enable both 'videosupport' and 'textsupport' in sip.conf  ---   By: Walter Doekes (wdoekes) 2012-01-19 03:21:24.272-0600(P.S. 1.6.2.x and lower look unaffected.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=783487#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-01-20 15:43:48 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way asterisk processed certain requests to negotiate secure video stream, when the res_srtp Asterisk module has been loaded and video support has not been enabled. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted media stream negotiation request, which once processed by Asterisk would lead to asterisk daemon crash by processing crypto line for such media stream.
