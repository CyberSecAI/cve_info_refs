{
  "CVE-2012-0459": {
    "Description": "The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) implementation is vulnerable to crashing due to modification of a keyframe followed by access to the cssText of the keyframe.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The keyframe rule had an nsAutoPtr<mozilla::css::Declaration> mDeclaration. When the DOM declaration was mutated, the underlying CSS declaration was mutable, so it was changed in-place. Then, nsCSSKeyframeStyleDeclaration::SetCSSDeclaration was called which calls nsCSSKeyframeRule::ChangeDeclaration, which assigned mDeclaration = aDeclaration, deleting the original declaration when mDeclaration == aDeclaration before the assignment.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A denial of service via application crash, or potentially code execution with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Opening a specially crafted web page."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Attacker must be able to trick a user into opening the crafted web page."
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was present in Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and Thunderbird ESR."
