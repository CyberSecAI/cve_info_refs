Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect file permissions being set on system state archive files created by the Update Manager during release upgrades. Specifically, the files `apt-clone_system_state.tar.gz` and `system_state.tar.gz` located in `/var/log/dist-upgrade/` were created without proper restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the creation of system state archive files with overly permissive access rights. These files contained sensitive information like repository credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Repository Passwords:** A local attacker, with access to the system, could read these archive files due to incorrect permissions. This would allow them to obtain repository passwords, potentially leading to further unauthorized access or manipulation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local system access. An attacker needs to have a user account on the system with the ability to read files in `/var/log/dist-upgrade/`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a local user account on the vulnerable system.
*   The attacker must have the ability to read the files located in `/var/log/dist-upgrade/`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `DistUpgrade/DistUpgradeMain.py` to create files with proper permissions and by updating the `debian/update-manager-core.postinst` script to clean up permissions on existing files.
* The fix included changing the permissions of the files `apt-clone_system_state.tar.gz` and `system_state.tar.gz` to 0600 which restricts access to the owner of the files.
* The vulnerability affects Ubuntu versions 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04.
* This vulnerability is related to CVE-2012-0949, which involves a related issue where the Apport hook incorrectly uploaded system state archive files containing repository passwords to Launchpad.
