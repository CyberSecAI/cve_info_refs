# USN-1443-1: Update Manager vulnerabilities

17 May 2012

Update Manager could expose sensitive information in certain circumstances.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)

## Packages

* [update-manager](/security/cves?package=update-manager) - GNOME application that manages apt updates

## Details

It was discovered that Update Manager created system state archive files

with incorrect permissions when upgrading releases. A local user could

possibly use this to read repository credentials. ([CVE-2012-0948](/security/CVE-2012-0948))

Felix Geyer discovered that the Update Manager Apport hook incorrectly

uploaded certain system state archive files to Launchpad when reporting

bugs. This could possibly result in repository credentials being included

in public bug reports. ([CVE-2012-0949](/security/CVE-2012-0949))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [update-manager-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/update-manager)
  -
  [1:0.156.14.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/update-manager/1%3A0.156.14.4)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [update-manager-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/update-manager)
  -
  [1:0.152.25.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/update-manager/1%3A0.152.25.11)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [update-manager-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/update-manager)
  -
  [1:0.150.5.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/update-manager/1%3A0.150.5.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
