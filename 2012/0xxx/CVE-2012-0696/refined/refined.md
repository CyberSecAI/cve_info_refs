Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the IBM APAR PM26682, which is related to CVE-2012-0696:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability identified in the IBM Cognos Executive Viewer. Specifically, the vulnerability was found within the `/aspnet_client` directory and in the `/evserver/createcontrol.js` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:

*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   Steal session cookies, potentially allowing for account hijacking.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Modify the content of the page viewed by the user.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through the vulnerable `/aspnet_client` directory and the `/evserver/createcontrol.js` file. The exact injection method is not specified in the provided text, but XSS vulnerabilities typically involve injecting scripts through user input or through manipulated URL parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application via vulnerable paths. This could happen through various means, such as by manipulating input fields or crafting malicious URLs that users might click on. The attacker does not require a privileged position; a typical user session would be sufficient to conduct the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered using the IBM Rational AppScan tool during a security assessment of a fresh installation of the Executive Viewer.
*   The fix involves upgrading to IBM Cognos Executive Viewer 9.5 Fix Pack 1.
*   The content from the secunia.com site is not relevant to this CVE. It describes the company's vulnerability research capabilities but does not contain information related to CVE-2012-0696.
