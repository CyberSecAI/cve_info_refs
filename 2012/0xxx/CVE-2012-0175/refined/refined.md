Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-0175:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Windows handles file and directory names with specially crafted names. The Windows Shell improperly processes these crafted names, leading to a command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious commands through specially crafted file/directory names due to improper input validation/handling by the Windows Shell.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the command injection vulnerability, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the affected system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can then install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Users with fewer rights are less impacted.**

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker can send a malicious file with a specially crafted name as an email attachment, and if the user opens the attachment, the exploit is triggered.
- **Web-based:** An attacker can host a website containing a file with a specially crafted name, and convince users to visit the website, leading to exploitation when the file is accessed.
- Compromised websites, or sites that accept/host user-provided content, could also be used to deliver the crafted file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create specially crafted file names:**  The attacker needs to craft files with malicious names that exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social engineering to trick users**: The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious files (email attachment or by visiting the malicious website).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Microsoft.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
- Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability when the bulletin was released.
- The vulnerability affects several versions of Windows including XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Windows 7.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Windows handles files and directories with specially crafted names.
- The advisory mentions that "Adi Cohen of IBM Security Systems - Application Security" reported the vulnerability.
