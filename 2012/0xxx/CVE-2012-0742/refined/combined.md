  * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: This APAR enhances Tivoli Event Pump    *
  *                      for z/OS product in accordance with IBM *
  *                      Secure Engineering Framework (SEF)      *
  *                      standards. It also contains fix for     *
  *                      S0C4 ABEND that could occur in internal *
  *                      codepage conversation routines.         *

  * RECOMMENDATION: Apply the PTF.                               *
  ****************************************************************
  Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS logs user related information
  (userid and password) into AOPSCLOG (AOPLOG) data set if options
  VALIDATE_SOAP_USERS and LOG_REQUESTS set to YES. Tivoli Event
  Pump for z/OS generates RACF PassTickets for user ID that is
  used by Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS address space to communicate
  with another instance of application. This information is used
  by other instances of Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS in SYSPLEX
  environment to check user credentials and perform requested
  action. Even if PassTickets have certain period of validity they
  can be used to execute third-party actions on particular Tivoli
  Event Pump for z/OS environment. There are also several minor
  security vulnerabilities in Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS product,
  but they could not affect users or systems running the product.

  The ABEND S0C4 could occur in Source Collector component for
  Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS:

  This ABEND occurs only for external (outside z/OS SYSPLEX) SOAP
  requests when ASCII to EBCDIC conversation is needed. Since
  Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS SOAP server does not involved in any
  heterogeneous interchange probability of this event is
  considerably low.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  Tivoli Event Pump for z/OS replaces the user related information
  (userid and password) with asterisk (*) symbols in AOPSCLOG
  (AOPLOG) data set.

  All minor security vulnerabilities as well as 0C4 ABEND in
  convertation routines were fixed.
