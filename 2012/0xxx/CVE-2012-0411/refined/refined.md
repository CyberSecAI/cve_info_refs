The provided document is a changelog for the Novell iPrint Client, detailing fixes and new features introduced in various versions. It includes a security fix associated with CVE-2012-0411 in the 5.82 client.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" in `op-client-interface-version`. This suggests a flaw in how the iPrint client handles the client interface version, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation or handling when processing the client interface version. This allows a remote attacker to potentially inject malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system running the vulnerable iPrint client. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the iPrint client's interface, specifically when handling the client interface version. The exact details of how this data is transmitted and processed are not provided.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send malicious data that is processed by the vulnerable iPrint client. This may require network access to the system running the iPrint client, or the ability to trick the user into interacting with a malicious server.
