Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0304:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure file system permissions on the installation directory of Symantec LiveUpdate Administrator (LUA). Specifically, the "Everyone" group had "Full Control" permissions on the installation directory. This allowed any local user to write to the installation directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File System Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the overly permissive file system permissions on the LUA installation directory.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The installation directory contained batch files which were executed with SYSTEM privileges, creating a vector for privilege escalation.
- **Manipulation of Configuration Files:** Attackers could potentially modify configuration files such as `clu.properties` and `tomcat-users.xml` to enable remote file access or add malicious users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged attacker could create or modify files (including batch files or JSP files) within the installation directory that would be executed with SYSTEM privileges, leading to full control over the affected system.
- **Remote File Access/Overwrite:** Through manipulation of configuration files, attackers could gain the ability to read or overwrite files remotely via HTTP requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File Creation/Modification:** Attackers can create or modify files in the installation directory that will be executed as SYSTEM.
- **HTTP Request Exploitation:** Attackers could send specially crafted HTTP requests to trigger execution of malicious JSP files or use modified configurations to achieve remote file access/overwrite.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine where Symantec LUA is installed.
- **Basic File System Access:** The attacker must be able to create or modify files within the LUA installation directory.
- **HTTP Access:** For remote exploitation, the attacker needs to have network access to send requests to the web server running with LUA.

**Additional Details:**
- The initial fix (LUA 2.3.1) did not completely resolve the issue, and a subsequent release (2.3.2) was necessary to fully mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was initially reported to Symantec in March 2011.
- Tenable assigned this vulnerability the ID TRA-2012-04.
- The vulnerability has both a medium and high CVSS score depending on the version used (v2 vs v3).
- Nessus plugin IDs 59193 and 59757 are associated with detecting this vulnerability.
