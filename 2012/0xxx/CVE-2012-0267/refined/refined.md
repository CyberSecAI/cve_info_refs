```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability exists in the `StopModule()` method of the NTR ActiveX control. The `lModule` parameter is used to dereference memory to get a function pointer. This allows an attacker to control the memory address being dereferenced, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Uncontrolled memory dereference, specifically, the `lModule` parameter allows control over the address that is dereferenced. This leads to a controllable function pointer which can be used for arbitrary code execution.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution under the context of the user visiting a malicious web page.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted web page that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control. When a user visits the malicious page, the javascript code is executed which performs a heap spray to overwrite the controlled pointer, allowing arbitrary code execution.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that the victim visits while using Internet Explorer. The attacker also needs to understand how to craft the javascript to exploit the vulnerability.
