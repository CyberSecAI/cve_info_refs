# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")â€Ž | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)
* [6 Sheriffing](#Sheriffing)
* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)
Steps to reproduce:
It is possible to bypass the user lockout policy by using the "X-FORWARDED-FOR" in the header of the request.
The problem is because of the "remote\_ip" function in "Bugzilla/Util.pm" which adds this header value to the user's IP address (there is also no validation on this field). However, this "X-FORWARDED-FOR" can be controlled by an attacker to brute force the other people username/password. The "remote\_ip" function also has been used in lockout modules ("Bugzilla/User.pm: account\_ip\_login\_failures()") which is the reason of having this issue.
Please let me know if it can be eligible for the bug bounty too.
Actual results:
It is possible to brute force a password without being locked by setting the "X-FORWARDED-FOR" value in the header of the authentication request to one of these:
1- A complete random IP or String
2- A string with the length of more than 26 characters. Ex.: "123456789012345678901234567"
Expected results:
It should prevent from brute force attack.
My recommendation is:
1- First we need to have a complete validation (characters, length, format) for $ENV{'HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR'} in the "remote\_ip" function.
2- This value should not be used in the user's lockout process as it can be controlled by the user. Only the main IP address should be fine for this action ($ENV{'REMOTE\_ADDR'}) although it can be a proxy IP address.

remote\_ip() has been added in Bugzilla 3.5.3, see [bug 527586](/show_bug.cgi?id=527586 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use X-Forwarded-For instead of REMOTE_ADDR for trusted proxies"). Note that "X-FORWARDED-FOR" is only taken into account if the 'inbound\_proxies' parameter is set.

But this validation won't help if the attacker is free to set the IP address he wants, right? He just has to pass a valid IP address to defeat this check. The equivalent of socket.inet\_aton(ip) in Python is Socket::getaddrinfo() in Perl, but it doesn't check that this is really the IP address the request is coming from.Target Milestone: --- â†’ Bugzilla 3.6Version: 4.0.4 â†’ 3.5.3

If I understand correctly how the X-Forwarded-For header is built, a trusted proxy will append the real remote IP address to the existing X-Forwarded-For header, and so this header could look like so (in the example below, there are 3 trusted proxies in the chain):
fake\_or\_real1, fake\_or\_real2, real\_remote\_ip, trusted\_proxy1, trusted\_proxy2
So the first addresses when starting from the left cannot be trusted, because they are easily faked by the client. The last addresses on the right are our trusted proxies and so we are confident about them. So if we take the last IP address not matching one of our trusted proxies (the one I named real\_remote\_ip), we get the real address of the remote machine, because this one has been inserted by the first trusted proxy in the chain, right? At this point, we don't care if this IP address is the one of the client machine itself or some intermediate proxy. In both cases is this the IP we want to block.

I still think we need to have validation before Splitting the X-Forwarded-For header by the comma "," character, because:
1- It can lead to denial of service if someone manage to send a lot of "," characters in X-Forwarded-For header in many requests (because of the for loop).
2- Is there any reason that you want to cover all the characters' sets in X-Forwarded-For header? As far as I know, it should only contain 0-9\,\ \. and its length should be limited to the number of possible proxies\*17; unless it can be set to anything by the trusted proxies (it is better to validate the format really - just be careful about the reDoS issues)
I should also say, as long as we do not have any CAPTCHA in here, this lockout policy can lead to a permanent DoS for the targeted users.

As we start from the end of the list, we will stop at the first external IP and ignore everything else. Your DoS won't work here. There is nothing bad you can do here which you couldn't do elsewhere.

We trust what our trusted proxy returns. We will never look at what external proxies or machines sent to us, so that's fine.

As we lock accounts on a per IP address basis, only your IP will be block.

By "validation", I meant the whole process including the X-Forwarded-For header, not just checking the IP.
However, on that note, we should be validating the IP using something like Data::Validation::IP::is\_ipv4() or Socket::getaddrinfo(). If anything in $ENV{'HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR'} is invalid, we should revert to using $ENV{'REMOTE\_ADDR'}. Just because we trust our proxy servers doesn't mean we should trust them to always return correct data and do the right thing with validation. We should still validate ourselves ("Trust, but verify" policy).
Also, are we doing any type of validation on what goes into Bugzilla->params->{'inbound\_proxies'}? If not, we probably should. A typo could be pretty bad.

patch, v1
i agree with reed -- we should be validating the IPs in x-forwarded-for and inbound\_proxies.
putting a dependency on Data::Validation::IP is an overkill, we should inline the is\_ipv4 method from that module instead:
sub is\_ipv4 {
my $value = shift;
return unless defined($value);
my (@octets) = $value =~ /^(\d{1,3})\.(\d{1,3})\.(\d{1,3})\.(\d{1,3})$/;
return unless @octets == 4;
foreach my $part (@octets) {
return unless $part >= 0 && $part <= 255 && $part !~ /^0\d{1,2}$/;
}
return 1;
}
aside from the lack of validation, your patch is fine.

I disagree. This would break IPv6 IP addresses.

Data::Validation::IP has is\_ipv6() which we could inline too.

This code already doesn't support IPv6 correctly (see the hardcoded "127.0.0.1"). However, it's just as simple to copy Data::Validation::IP::is\_ipv6() as well.

Did someone recently change the account lockout code to how the X-Forwarded-For path? This might be a b.m.o hack. I know until recently it was listing the proxy server because we were getting lockouts from bzAPI people listing the bzAPI server as the IP. The lockout notices I got for Soroush's attempts to test this listed the X-Forwarded-For path in the lockout notice (which is not good - should have only been listing the "real\_remote\_ip" as defined in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=728639#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] User lockout policy can be bypassed by altering the X-FORWARDED-FOR header").
FWIW, I almost locked out Soroush's account permanently (at least until he would get in contact with us to validate he was in control of his own account) based on these lockouts because a) it was obvious someone was trying to brute force his account, and b) he has filed several security bugs. But then I saw this bug and realized he was just testing this bug. :)

OK, from discussion on IRC it looks like the (correct) code that was locally hacked on b.m.o in version 3.4 got incorrectly imported upstream in 3.6 ([bug 527586](/show_bug.cgi?id=527586 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use X-Forwarded-For instead of REMOTE_ADDR for trusted proxies")), and has been broken since. Not quite sure why we're only seeing this on b.m.o now when we've been on 4.0 for a while now.

The hardcoded 127.0.0.1 is fine, as we only use it if we got no remote IP address at all. Else we would use the IPv6 one set into $ENV{'REMOTE\_ADDR'}.

Probably because there aren't so many attackers around trying to brute force passwords in b.m.o.

... which would still be invalid for an IPv6-only box, as it should be ::1 then. ;)

Keep in mind that until fairly recently, admin notifications for account lockouts were broken ([bug 707594](/show_bug.cgi?id=707594 "RESOLVED FIXED - Account lockout notifications are not notifying the maintainer")).

this should always work (however i don't have an ipv6-only box to test on):

Not necessarily. Most ipv6-capable boxes I've seen map ::1 to "localhost6" in the hosts file, and "localhost" still goes to 127.0.0.1.

We don't care about 127.0.0.1 vs ::1. In both cases, we didn't get the remote IP address and so we fall back to some default. We could fall back to "unknown" that this wouldn't change the story.
