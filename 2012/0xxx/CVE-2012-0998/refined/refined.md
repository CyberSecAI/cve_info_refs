Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security-related information:

**General Information**

*   **Vulnerability Announcement:** On January 25, 2012, the LEPTON team was informed of security issues affecting all existing releases.
*   **Fix:**  These issues were addressed in LEPTON 1.1.4, released on February 4, 2012. Users are strongly advised to update.
*   **Disclosure:** Details of the security issues were planned for publication around February 15, 2012.

**Specific Vulnerabilities & Fixes (based on commit messages)**

*   **Vulnerability 1:**  "Fix for vuln 2 and 3.1 from High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab"
    *   **Affected files:** `/branches/LEPTON_1.1.x/upload/modules/news/rss.php` and `/branches/LEPTON_1.1.x/upload/admins/login/forgot/index.php`
    *   **Likely Vulnerabilities:**  This suggests there were at least two distinct issues identified by High-Tech Bridge SA, possibly involving:
        *   Improper handling of input within the news/rss module (potentially leading to XSS or SQL Injection).
        *   Vulnerabilities in the password recovery mechanism (`/admins/login/forgot/index.php`).
*   **Vulnerability 2:** Unchecked POST variables.
    *   **Affected File:** `/branches/LEPTON_1.1.x/upload/account/preferences.php`
    *   **Vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-submitted data in the preferences page, potentially leading to injection attacks or other data manipulation issues.
*  **Vulnerability 3:** Issues related to invalid tokens.
    *   **Affected File:** `/branches/LEPTON_1.1.x/upload/framework/class.securecms.php`
    *    **Vulnerability:** Problems with invalid tokens, which were mitigated by commenting out specific session and token verification lines.
*  **Vulnerability 4:** Potential Name Clashing.
    *  **Affected File:** `/branches/LEPTON_1.1.x/upload/admins/modules/install.php`
    * **Vulnerability:** Variable names beginning with `$new_` were changed to `$new_lepton_` to prevent name collisions, suggesting potential issues during module installation.
*   **Vulnerability 5:** `register_globals` check.
    *   **Affected File:** `/branches/LEPTON_1.1.x/upload/admins/start/index.php`
    *   **Vulnerability:** A check for `register_globals` was implemented, indicating that the software was potentially vulnerable to this deprecated PHP feature if enabled, leading to potential security risks.
*  **Vulnerability 6:** Frontend signup vulnerability
     * **Affected File:** `/branches/LEPTON_1.1.x/upload/account/signup.php`
     * **Vulnerability:**  Bugfix indicates there was an issue during frontend signup.
*   **General Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **TinyMCE Update:** The update of TinyMCE to version 3.4.8 suggests potential vulnerabilities existed in the older version.
    *    **Numerous bug fixes:** The numerous bug fixes in various files point to potential vulnerabilities, most of which seem to stem from coding errors, improper input validation and potential misconfiguration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The specific impact would vary based on the exploited vulnerability.
*   Potential impacts include:
    *   **Data Breaches:** Through SQL Injection.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Through improper handling of inputs.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Through password reset vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code execution:** Through other injection vulnerabilities and `register_globals` exploitation.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Though less likely, some vulnerabilities could lead to DoS.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Through XSS or other injection attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** All listed vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **User Input:** Several issues stem from insufficient handling of user input, making input validation failures a significant vector.
*   **Browser:** Cross-site scripting would target the users' browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   **Knowledge:** The attacker would require knowledge of the specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Network access:** The attacker would need network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **HTTP client:**  The attacker would require a tool that could send HTTP requests, such as a web browser, curl or a dedicated penetration testing tool.

**Summary:**

The provided content indicates that LEPTON 1.1.x had multiple security vulnerabilities, including issues related to input validation, session management, password recovery, and third-party components (like TinyMCE). The LEPTON team addressed these with the release of version 1.1.4.

It's worth noting that the information is extracted from commit logs and release notes, and does not include complete details about the vulnerabilities themselves.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The reference to "vuln 2 und 3.1" from High-Tech Bridge SA suggests an external vulnerability report may exist. This could provide further details.
*   The large number of bug fixes indicates a need for more rigorous security testing during the development process.
