  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from how ImageMagick processes images with malformed Exchangeable Image File Format (Exif) metadata.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service Vulnerability: ImageMagick enters an infinite loop when processing malformed Exif metadata."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by creating a specially crafted image file that causes ImageMagick to enter an infinite loop, consuming excessive CPU resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious image file with malformed Exif metadata.",
      "The victim opens the crafted image file using ImageMagick."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious image file. The victim needs to use an application that uses ImageMagick to process the image file."
