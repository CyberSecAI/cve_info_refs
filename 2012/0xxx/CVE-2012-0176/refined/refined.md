Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2012-0176:

**Vulnerability:** Silverlight Double-Free Vulnerability

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Silverlight incorrectly freeing memory while rendering specially crafted XAML glyphs. This double-free condition leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Double-free vulnerability:** A flaw in memory management where allocated memory is released more than once, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Unsafe memory access:** A specially crafted Silverlight application could access memory in an unsafe manner due to the double-free condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the logged-on user.
*   **System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Potential Denial of Service:** The memory corruption can potentially cause a denial of service due to instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Browsing Attack Scenario:** Attackers can host a malicious website containing a specially crafted Silverlight application.
*   Compromised websites and sites hosting user-provided content could also be used for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website, typically through a link in email or instant messages, or by exploiting compromised websites.
* The attacker needs to have the ability to craft a malicious Silverlight application with specific XAML glyphs to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft Silverlight 4 and 5.
*   The update addresses the issue by correcting the manner in which Microsoft Silverlight resets pointers when freeing memory.
*   Mitigating factors include running Internet Explorer on Windows Server with Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Workarounds include temporarily disabling the Silverlight ActiveX control in browsers such as IE, Firefox or Chrome
