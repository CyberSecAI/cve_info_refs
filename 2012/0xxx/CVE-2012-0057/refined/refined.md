Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-0057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the unrestricted use of the libxslt library within PHP, specifically in how it processes XSLT transformations. The libxslt library allows for a non-standard extension tag `<sax:output>` that allows writing the output of the transformation to a file. This capability is not part of the official XSLT 1.0 specification, but PHP applications parsing untrusted XSLT code may use this libxslt functionality, which enables remote attackers to create arbitrary files with arbitrary content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** The core vulnerability is the ability to create files on the server file system through a malicious XSLT stylesheet due to the use of the `<sax:output>` tag extension of libxslt.
*   **Unrestricted Output Path:** Attackers can control the output file name and location through the `href` attribute of `<sax:output>`, potentially allowing them to write files into sensitive areas of the server.
*  **Control of output file content**: Attackers can specify the content of the written files via the `<xsl:value-of select>` tag.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** PHP does not sufficiently validate or restrict the XSLT code, making it possible to include the malicious tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation:** Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to write arbitrary files to the server, potentially including PHP code which may lead to further compromise if executed.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By crafting the XSLT to write a PHP file, an attacker could then execute arbitrary code on the server by requesting the created PHP file. This can lead to full server compromise.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly mentioned in the extracted content, it's possible that creating many files, or large files, could lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Controlled XSLT Stylesheets:** The primary attack vector involves an application that processes user-controlled XSLT stylesheets.
*   **Malicious XSLT Code:**  An attacker crafts a malicious XSLT stylesheet that contains the `<sax:output>` tag extension.
*   **Target Application:** The attacker provides the malicious XSLT stylesheet to a vulnerable PHP application that uses XSLT transformations, for example, online XSLT gateways or applications that process SVG images, XML-DSig signatures or SAML tokens.
*   **File Access:** The vulnerable PHP application processes the XSLT, creating arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Remote Execution:**  The attacker then requests the malicious PHP file and executes code on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Submit XSLT Stylesheets:** The attacker needs the ability to provide XSLT stylesheets to a PHP application running on the target server.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** To achieve full remote code execution, the attacker would need to know (or guess) a location where the generated PHP file can be executed via HTTP requests.

In summary, CVE-2012-0057 highlights a vulnerability in PHP's XSLT processing that enables an attacker to create arbitrary files with attacker-defined content on the server via a specially crafted XSLT stylesheet, potentially leading to arbitrary remote code execution. The vulnerability was triggered by using libxslt's non-standard <sax:output> tag extension, and was mitigated by implementing the `XsltProcessor::setSecurityPrefs()` and `xsl.security_prefs` INI option, which disabled write operations.
