- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a bug (CSCts01106) in Cisco IOS where extended Access Control Lists (ACLs) fail when the "log" or "time" keywords are used within the ACL configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness lies in the incorrect processing of extended ACLs when the "log" or "time" keywords are used. This leads to the ACLs not functioning as expected.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of this issue is that ACLs configured with "log" or "time" keywords will not filter traffic as intended, potentially allowing unauthorized access or traffic flow. This can lead to a breach of network security policies.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the configuration of extended ACLs using the vulnerable "log" or "time" keywords. No direct attack is involved, the issue arises from misconfiguration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific attacker capabilities or positions are needed, the vulnerability is a configuration issue.
