{
  "cveId": "CVE-2012-0063",
  "description": "Insecure plugin update mechanism in tucan through 0.3.10 could allow remote attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running tucan.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The tucan application downloads plugin updates (which are Python scripts) over HTTP/HTTPS without verifying the authenticity or integrity of the downloaded files. There are no checks for signatures or certificates during the update process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure update mechanism",
      "Lack of authenticity checks for plugin updates",
      "No integrity checks",
      "Missing certificate validation during HTTPS connections"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to inject malicious code into plugin updates. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running tucan.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack",
      "Compromise of the remote update server"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the tucan application and the update server, or to compromise the update server itself.",
        "additionalDetails": "The plugins are executed with the privileges of the user running the tucan application, making it easier for an attacker to gain a foothold within the target system. There was no code signing or certificate validation to ensure the plugins originated from a legitimate source."
