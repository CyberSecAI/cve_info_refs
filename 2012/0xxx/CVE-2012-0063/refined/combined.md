Subject: tucan: insecure update mechanism
Date: Wed, 18 Jan 2012 23:19:38 +0000
```
Package: tucan
Version: 0.3.9-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Tucan comes with "plugins" to handle downloads from the various
download sites it supports. These plugins are basically python modules
which run with the same permissions as the user running tucan. The
tucan package comes with a set of such plugins in
/usr/share/default_plugins/, but it downloads updates of these plugins
via http/https and places them in ~/.tucan/plugins/. This means that
after an update, debian-packaged code is effectively replaced by code
directly from the upstream repository. This in itself is problematic,
but because the update mechanism is implemented in an insecure
fashion, a remote attacker could use it introduce a malicious plugin
which executes arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
tucan.

The plugins tucan downloads are unsigned, so a remote attacker could
introduce a plugin containing malicious code either by compromising
the remote sites where the plugins are stored, or by means of a
man-in-the-middle attack on the http/https connection from tucan to
the site holding the updates (tucan doesn't seem to check the server
certificate on SSL connections). Tools for automating this kind of
exploit exist, e.g. <https://code.google.com/p/ippon-mitm/>

The best way to address this problem is probably to disable the update
mechanism entirely in the debian package, and distribute updated
plugin files via apt. (Upstream might want to look into signing their updates,
and possibly making changes to the program's design so that the plugins
run in some kind of sandbox rather than with full user permissions.)

Hi,

The upstream is not active since May of 2011[0], furthermore the
update plugins process is not secure and many plugins don't work,
please remove tucan from the archive.

[0] <http://code.google.com/p/tucan/source/list>

In advance, thank you so much.

Kind regards,

Subject: Bug#656388: Removed package(s) from unstable
Date: Mon, 23 Jan 2012 22:12:38 +0000
```
We believe that the bug you reported is now fixed; the following
package(s) have been removed from unstable:

     tucan |   0.3.10-2 | source, all

------------------- Reason -------------------
RoM; abandoned upstream
----------------------------------------------

Note that the package(s) have simply been removed from the tag
database and may (or may not) still be in the pool; this is not a bug.
The package(s) will be physically removed automatically when no suite
references them (and in the case of source, when no binary references
it).  Please also remember that the changes have been done on the
master archive (ftp-master.debian.org) and will not propagate to any
mirrors (ftp.debian.org included) until the next cron.daily run at the
earliest.

Packages are usually not removed from testing by hand. Testing tracks
unstable and will automatically remove packages which were removed
from unstable when removing them from testing causes no dependency
problems. The release team can force a removal from testing if it is
really needed, please contact them if this should be the case.

We try to close Bugs which have been reported against this package
automatically.  But please check all old bugs, if they where closed
correctly or should have been re-assign to another package.

Thank you for reporting the bug, which will now be closed.  If you
have further comments please address them to 656388@bugs.debian.org.

The full log for this bug can be viewed at <http://bugs.debian.org/656388>

This message was generated automatically; if you believe that there is
a problem with it please contact the archive administrators by mailing

Reassigning RC bugs is rarely a good idea...

Okay, so the package has been removed form unstable, but what about
squeeze?

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) 	- use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

0: debian-release@lists.debian.org
1: <201101232332.11736.thijs@debian.org>

Thanks,

with his security hat on:

Reopening is the correct thing to do, but what is your plan for fixing the

```
Version: 10.3.9-1+rm

Hi,

tucan has been removed from Debian unstable and is no longer in testing
nor the last stable release.  I am taking the liberty of closing all
remaining bugs filed against tucan.  Sorry, we cannot provide with a
better resolution to your bug.

Note that bugs still affecting eresi in oldstable remain "open" and will
do so until oldstable is no longer supported or the bug is fixed via opu
(if applicable).

~Niels

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=782999#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-19 02:05:44 UTC  ``` A Debian bug report [1] noted some insecurities in how Tucan handles plugins (quoting from the report):  Tucan comes with "plugins" to handle downloads from the various download sites it supports. These plugins are basically python modules which run with the same permissions as the user running tucan. The tucan package comes with a set of such plugins in /usr/share/default_plugins/, but it downloads updates of these plugins via http/https and places them in ~/.tucan/plugins/. This means that after an update, debian-packaged code is effectively replaced by code directly from the upstream repository. This in itself is problematic, but because the update mechanism is implemented in an insecure fashion, a remote attacker could use it introduce a malicious plugin which executes arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running tucan.  The plugins tucan downloads are unsigned, so a remote attacker could introduce a plugin containing malicious code either by compromising the remote sites where the plugins are stored, or by means of a man-in-the-middle attack on the http/https connection from tucan to the site holding the updates (tucan doesn't seem to check the server certificate on SSL connections). Tools for automating this kind of exploit exist, e.g. <https://code.google.com/p/ippon-mitm/>  The best way to address this problem is probably to disable the update mechanism entirely in the debian package, and distribute updated plugin files via apt. (Upstream might want to look into signing their updates, and possibly making changes to the program's design so that the plugins run in some kind of sandbox rather than with full user permissions.)    I agree with the reporter; this kind of update mechanism is susceptible to MITM, and because these plugins are python scripts, almost anything could be done when they are unwittingly executed by the user.  We may want to look into disabling this insecure update mechanism ourselves.  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=656388>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=782999#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-19 16:07:21 UTC  ``` Created tucan tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 783187](show_bug.cgi?id=783187 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-0063 tucan: insecure plugin update mechanism [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=782999#c2)  Simon    2013-08-07 06:19:47 UTC  ``` upstream is dead tucan is retired since 2013-01-29 won't fix for f18   ``` |  |

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
