- The user needs to be convinced to perform an action, such as clicking on a link or viewing a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker requires some expertise and possibly luck to successfully exploit this buffer overflow.
-  The attacker needs to get the victim to interact with a malicious image file, such as by opening the file or clicking a link to the file.

**Additional Notes:**
