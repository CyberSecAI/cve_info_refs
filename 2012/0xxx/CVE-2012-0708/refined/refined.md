Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-0708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a defect in the IBM Rational ClearQuest OLE API. Specifically, a function within the API can be called with incorrect parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Parameter Handling:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation or handling of parameters passed to the vulnerable OLE API function. This allows the function to be misused.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:**  Exploitation can lead to a crash of the application or system.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Possible):** The vulnerability could allow for the execution of arbitrary code by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **OLE API Function Call:**  The attack vector involves calling the vulnerable ClearQuest OLE API function with specially crafted, incorrect parameters. This would likely be triggered through interaction with an application using the vulnerable ActiveX control.
*   **Untrusted Applications:** The vulnerability is triggered through an application using the vulnerable API, indicating the attack vector requires execution of a malicious program or script that uses the ClearQuest OLE API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Windows Platform:** The target system must be running on a Microsoft Windows platform.
*   **ClearQuest Components Installed:** The target machine must have ClearQuest .dll files installed. This occurs when any of the following ClearQuest components are installed:
    *   ClearQuest Client (Eclipse-based)
    *   ClearQuest Client for Windows (Microsoft MFC-based)
    *   ClearQuest Web Server or server components
*   **Ability to execute untrusted applications or leverage ActiveX:** The attacker needs to be able to execute malicious code, which could involve convincing the user to run untrusted programs or to interact with a malicious webpage that uses the vulnerable ActiveX component.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects *all* versions of ClearQuest, but only on Windows platforms.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Andrea Micalizzi aka rgod, working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   IBM provides fix packs for different versions of Rational ClearQuest to address the vulnerability.
*   Mitigation includes not running untrusted applications and configuring browsers to not allow ActiveX controls to run.
