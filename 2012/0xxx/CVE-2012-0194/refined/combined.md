## Error description

* ```
  When the tcp maxseg (t_maxseg) goes below 6 and largesend
  is
  enabled, system would assert in tcp_output.
  By default mss is 1460, but due to pmtu discovery if the
  mtu
  drops to 68, it is possible to have a low mss.

## Error description

* ```
  When the tcp maxseg (t_maxseg) goes below 6 and largesend
  is
  enabled, system would assert in tcp_output.
  By default mss is 1460, but due to pmtu discovery if the
  mtu
  drops to 68, it is possible to have a low mss.

  The stack would be similar to,
