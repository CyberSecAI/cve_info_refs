How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Ok went through the list a bit, the latest one already exists,
assigned the 2011's:

========================================

31 January 2012
SilverStripe v2.4.7 - XSS in text transformations on templates and
page title saving in CMS (details)
SilverStripe v2.3.13 - See 2.4.7 (details)
(already assigned) CVE-2012-0976 	Cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability in admin/EditForm in SilverStripe 2.4.6 allows remote
authenticated users with Content Authors privileges to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the Title parameter. NOTE: some of
these details are obtained from third party information.

========================================

18 October 2011
SilverStripe v2.4.6 - XSS in anchor links, possible SQL injection with
far eastern encodings, possible remote code execution through page
comments (details)
SilverStripe v2.3.12 - See 2.4.6 (details)

CVE-2011-4958 Security: Cross-site scripting on anchor links

CVE-2011-4959 Security: Possible SQL injection for MySQL when using
far east character encodings

CVE-2011-4960 Security: SQL injection in Folder::findOrMake()
parameter (used mostly in author-only CMS through Upload::load())

CVE-2011-4961 Security: Privilege escalation from EDIT_PERMISSIONS to
ADMIN for users access to the CMS (through Member->getCMSFields() and
TreeMultiselectField)

CVE-2011-4962 Security: Potential remote code execution through
serialization of page comment user submissions

========================================

I'll assign the 2010's when I get some more 2010 CVE's.

Looks good, as long as we acknowledge that statusMessage expects HTML not text.
