# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# MaraDNS 1 update

[Previous entry](20111224.html) -
[Next entry](20111230.html) -
[Blog index](/blog/idx.html)
## December 29 2011

One issue with making software is that a responsible programmer takes
responsibility for his mistakes. Even if the mistakes were made years
ago. MaraDNS is a lot of code dating back to 2001; even though a good
deal of the code has been completely rewritten, I still take
responsibility for code I wrote in 2001 and 2002.

I very strongly encourage people still using MaraDNS 1.x's recursive
code to upgrade to MaraDNS 2, and use Deadwood to process recursive
queries. I have completely rewritten the code from the ground up --
Deadwood shares no code whatsoever with MaraDNS -- and did a better
job of it the second time around.

The new Deadwood recursive resolver, for example, has been using
randomized hashes since 2007, and today's hash randomization attack
making the rounds has never affected Deadwood. The older MaraDNS 1.x
recursive code, however, did not use a randomized hash. While people
really should be using Deadwood for recursive queries, I have released
MaraDNS 1.4.08 and MaraDNS 1.3.07.12 with an updated randomized hash.

For anyone who is still using MaraDNS 1, it is important to upgrade to
this version in order so that hashes are randomized and not vulnerable
to hash collision denial of service attacks. Or better yet, upgrade
to MaraDNS 2.

Note that a randomized hash needs a source of entropy; that in mind,
the \*NIX version of MaraDNS 1.4.08/1.3.07.12 requires /dev/urandom and
the Windows version of MaraDNS needs "secret.txt" in the same
directory as "maradns.exe". People running MaraDNS 1 on \*NIX systems
without /dev/urandom are on their own -- I do not support MaraDNS on
anything besides CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Windows.

Note that this security bug only affects you if:

* You are using MaraDNS 1, \*not\* MaraDNS 2* recursive\_acl is set in MaraDNS 1* Untrusted potential attackers can perform recursive queries with MaraDNS 1.

For example, if using MaraDNS 1 as described in
<http://samiam.org/blog/20111128.html>,
one is safe as long as ones mararc file recursive\_acl line looks
like this:
> recursive\_acl = "127.0.0.1/8"

The tarballs files can be found here:
> <http://maradns.org/download/1.3>
>
> <http://maradns.org/download/1.4>
> (also has Windows binary)

The patch is here:
> <http://maradns.org/download/patches/maradns-1.3-secret_hash.patch>

No, MaraDNS 2.0's authoritative server does not use a randomized hash.
No, this is not a problem because a remote attacker can not control the
hash keys. Yes, this could be an issue if an untrusted attacker were able
to control MaraDNS' zone files, but that is a much smaller attack surface.
I will fix this in MaraDNS 2.0, but only once Deadwood 3.2 is out the
door next year.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=771428#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-03 18:04:45 UTC  ``` MaraDNS suffers from an error with the hash generation function which can be exploited to cause a hash collision resulting in high CPU consumption (Denial of Service).  This flaw has been corrected in versions 1.3.07.13 and 1.4.09.

NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2012-0024](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0024).   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-5056](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-5056) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2011-5056](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-5056) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-5056> Assigned: 20120107 Reference: <http://samiam.org/blog/20111229.html>  The authoritative server in MaraDNS through 2.0.04 computes hash values for DNS data without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted records in zone files, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2012-0024](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0024).

NOTE: as we have not shipped any incomplete fixes, the [CVE-2011-5055](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-5055) entry is here for reference; nothing we ship is actually vulnerable to it.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=771428#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-02 15:58:05 UTC  ``` Current Fedora ships with 2.0.07 so is not vulnerable, however EPEL5 does still ship with a vulnerable version.  The EPEL5 tracker will remain open until it is fixed.   ``` |  |
