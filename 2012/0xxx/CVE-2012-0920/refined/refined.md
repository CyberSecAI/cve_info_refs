Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-0920:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the Dropbear SSH daemon. This occurs due to how the server manages channel concurrency when handling multiple command requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability (CWE-416):  The vulnerability occurs when memory is freed but later accessed, potentially leading to corruption. Specifically, the `original_command` variable is freed prematurely when command restrictions are used in authorized\_keys, and then accessed when a new channel is opened on the same session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with root privileges:  A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated user to execute arbitrary code on the target system with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The attack is initiated by a remote user sending specially crafted requests over the network to a vulnerable Dropbear SSH server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate to the Dropbear server using public key authentication.
- Public key authentication with command restriction: The vulnerability is triggered when the user is authenticated via public key authentication, and their authorized\_keys entry has a "command=" restriction specified, which causes a command to be forced upon login.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the server's channel handling code.
- The fix involves moving the `original_command` from `authstate` into the `ChanSess` struct, so it's properly associated with each session and doesn't get freed prematurely when the `authstate` is cleared.
- The vulnerability is triggered when multiple command requests are sent for the same SSH session.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Danny Fullerton from Mantor Organization.
- The issue affects Dropbear versions prior to 2012.55.
- Debian Security Advisory DSA-2456-1 addresses the vulnerability.
