{
  "CVE-2012-0868": {
    "description": "pg_dump was incautious about sanitizing object names that are emitted within SQL comments in its output script. A name containing a newline would at least render the script syntactically incorrect. Maliciously crafted object names could present a SQL injection risk when the script is reloaded.",
    "root_cause": "The pg_dump utility did not sanitize object names, specifically newlines, when inserting them into SQL comments within its output scripts.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL injection",
      "Improper sanitization of input"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user could craft object names containing newlines followed by SQL commands. When a dump file containing these objects is reloaded, the embedded SQL commands would be executed with the privileges of the user performing the restore, potentially leading to privilege escalation and arbitrary SQL code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Creating database objects with malicious names",
      "Reloading pg_dump output with crafted objects"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create database objects with specific, malicious names. The attacker also relies on a privileged user re-loading the pg_dump output. An attacker must also have the capability to inject newlines into object names."
