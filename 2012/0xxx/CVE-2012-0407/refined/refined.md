Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2012-0407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The identified vulnerabilities stem from two distinct issues within the EMC Data Protection Advisor:

*   **A] cProcessAuthenticationData NULL pointer:** A missing or empty password field in the `AUTHENTICATECONNECTION` command leads to a NULL pointer dereference in the `DPA_Utilities.cProcessAuthenticationData` function. Specifically, the code attempts to use a potentially null pointer when calculating the length of a string.

*   **B] thread CPU 100%:**  An infinite loop occurs within the `DPA_Utilities` library when processing a negative 64-bit size field in the protocol. This loop causes high CPU usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** In the first vulnerability, the software doesn't properly handle missing or empty password fields, leading to dereferencing of a null pointer.
*   **Infinite Loop:** The second vulnerability allows a specially crafted packet containing a negative size value, to cause a processing loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Both vulnerabilities result in a denial of service. The NULL pointer dereference will crash the affected service. The infinite loop will cause high CPU usage, potentially degrading system performance and rendering the service unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** Both vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service.
*   For the NULL pointer dereference, the attacker needs to send an `AUTHENTICATECONNECTION` command with an empty or missing password field.
*   For the infinite loop, the attacker must send a specially crafted network packet including a negative 64bit size field.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities affect EMC Data Protection Advisor versions 5.8.1 and earlier.
*   The identified vulnerabilities affect the `DPA_Controller` (port 3916) and `DPA_Listener` (port 4001) services.
*   The `udpsz` tool and a custom `dpa_1` exploit are provided as proof-of-concept (PoC) for demonstrating the vulnerabilities.
*   A fix was released later by EMC.
