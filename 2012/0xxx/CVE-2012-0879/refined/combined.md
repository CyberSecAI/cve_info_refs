# USN-1410-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerability

27 March 2012

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Louis Rilling discovered a flaw in Linux kernel's clone command when

CLONE\_IO is specified. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to

cause a denial of service.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-344-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-344.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-344.46)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : linux-2.6
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation/denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2011-4086 CVE-2012-0879 CVE-2012-1601 CVE-2012-2123
                 CVE-2012-2133

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-4086

    Eric Sandeen reported an issue in the journaling layer for EXT4 filesystems
    (jbd2). Local users can cause buffers to be accessed after they have been
    torn down, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) due to a system crash.

CVE-2012-0879

    Louis Rilling reported two reference counting issues in the CLONE_IO
    feature of the kernel. Local users can prevent io context structures
    from being freed, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2012-1601

    Michael Ellerman reported an issue in the KVM subsystem. Local users could
    cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by creating VCPUs
    before a call to KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP.

CVE-2012-2123

    Steve Grubb reported in an issue in fcaps, a filesystem-based capabilities
    system. Personality flags set using this mechanism, such as the disabling
    of address space randomization, may persist across suid calls.

CVE-2012-2133

    Shachar Raindel discovered a use-after-free bug in the hugepages
    quota implementation. Local users with permission to use hugepages
    via the hugetlbfs implementation may be able to cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-44. Updates are currently only available for the amd64, i386 and sparc
ports.

NOTE: Updated linux-2.6 packages will also be made available in the release
of Debian 6.0.5, scheduled to take place the weekend of 2012.05.12. This
pending update will be version 2.6.32-45, and provides an additional fix for
build failures on some architectures. Users for whom this update is not
critical, and who may wish to avoid multiple reboots, should consider waiting

block: Fix io\_context leak after failure of clone with CLONE\_IO

```
With CLONE_IO, parent's io_context->nr_tasks is incremented, but never
decremented whenever copy_process() fails afterwards, which prevents
exit_io_context() from calling IO schedulers exit functions.

Give a task_struct to exit_io_context(), and call exit_io_context() instead of
put_io_context() in copy_process() cleanup path.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* Numerous reference count leaks were found in the Linux kernel's block

layer I/O context handling implementation. This could allow a local,
unprivileged user to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-0879,
Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's cifs\_lookup() implementation.

POSIX open during lookup should only be supported for regular files. When
non-regular files (for example, a named (FIFO) pipe or other special files)
are opened on lookup, it could cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-1090,
Moderate)

* It was found that the Linux kernel's register set (regset) common

infrastructure implementation did not check if the required get and set
handlers were initialized. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
to cause a denial of service by performing a register set operation with a
ptrace() PTRACE\_SETREGSET or PTRACE\_GETREGSET request. (CVE-2012-1097,
Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank H. Peter Anvin for reporting CVE-2012-1097.

This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.
Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs and add the enhancements
noted in the Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

An update that solves 8 vulnerabilities and has 60 fixes is
now available. It includes one version update.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 kernel have been updated
to the 2.6.32.59 stable release to fix a lot of bugs and
security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\* CVE-2012-2133: A use after free bug in hugetlb
support could be used by local attackers to crash the
system.
\* CVE-2012-1097: A null pointer dereference bug in the
regsets proc file could be used by local attackers to
perhaps crash the system. With mmap\_min\_addr is set and
enabled, exploitation is unlikely.
\* CVE-2012-0879: A reference counting issue in CLONE\_IO
could be used by local attackers to cause a denial of
service (out of memory).
\* CVE-2012-1090: A file handle leak in CIFS code could
be used by local attackers to crash the system.
\* CVE-2011-1083: Large nested epoll chains could be
used by local attackers to cause a denial of service
(excessive CPU consumption).
\* CVE-2011-4622: When using KVM, programming a PIT
timer without a irqchip configuration, can be used to crash
the kvm guest. This likely can be done only by a privileged
guest user.
\* CVE-2012-0045: A KVM 32bit guest crash in "syscall"
opcode handling was fixed that could be caused by local
attackers.
\* CVE-2011-4086: Fixed a oops in jbd/jbd2 that could be
caused by specific filesystem access patterns.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=796829#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-23 18:05:09 UTC  ``` With CLONE_IO, copy_io() increments both ioc->refcount and ioc->nr_tasks. However exit_io_context() only decrements ioc->refcount if ioc->nr_tasks reaches 0.  With CLONE_IO, parent's io_context->nr_tasks is incremented, but never decremented whenever copy_process() fails afterwards, which prevents xit_io_context() from calling IO schedulers exit functions.  An unprivileged local user could use these flaws cause denial of service.  Upstream fixes: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/61cc74fbb87af6aa551a06a370590c9bc07e29d9> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/b69f2292063d2caf37ca9aec7d63ded203701bf3>  References: <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/922519>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=796829#c3)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-23 18:40:22 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not provide support for CLONE_IO. This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they already contain the fix. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0481.html>.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=796829#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-23 21:49:26 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/02/23/5>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=796829#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-17 18:56:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0481 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0481.html>   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor6 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0531)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes three security issues and
one bug is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way libtasn1 decoded DER data. An attacker could
create carefully-crafted DER encoded input (such as an X.509 certificate)
that, when parsed by an application that uses libtasn1 (such as
applications using GnuTLS), could cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2012-1569)

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS decrypted malformed TLS records. This
could cause a TLS/SSL client or server to crash when processing a
specially-crafted TLS record from a remote TLS/SSL connection peer.
(CVE-2012-1573)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the implementation of the printf
functions family. This could allow an attacker to bypass FORTIFY\_SOURCE
protections and execute arbitrary code using a format string flaw in an
application, even though these protections are expected to limit the
impact of such flaws to an application abort. (CVE-2012-0864)

Red Hat would like to thank Matthew Hall of Mu Dynamics for reporting
CVE-2012-1569 and CVE-2012-1573.

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

CVE-2011-4128 (gnutls issue)

CVE-2012-0879, CVE-2012-1090, and CVE-2012-1097 (kernel issues)

CVE-2012-0884 and CVE-2012-1165 (openssl issues)

CVE-2012-0060, CVE-2012-0061, and CVE-2012-0815 (rpm issues)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The Hypervisor previously set the lro\_disable option for the enic driver.

The driver does not support this option, as a result the Hypervisor did
not correctly detect and configure the network interfaces of a Cisco M81KR
adaptor, when present. The Hypervisor has been updated and no longer sets
the invalid option for this driver. (BZ#809463)

Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=796829#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-23 18:05:09 UTC  ``` With CLONE_IO, copy_io() increments both ioc->refcount and ioc->nr_tasks. However exit_io_context() only decrements ioc->refcount if ioc->nr_tasks reaches 0.  With CLONE_IO, parent's io_context->nr_tasks is incremented, but never decremented whenever copy_process() fails afterwards, which prevents xit_io_context() from calling IO schedulers exit functions.  An unprivileged local user could use these flaws cause denial of service.  Upstream fixes: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/61cc74fbb87af6aa551a06a370590c9bc07e29d9> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/b69f2292063d2caf37ca9aec7d63ded203701bf3>  References: <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/922519>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=796829#c3)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-23 18:40:22 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not provide support for CLONE_IO. This issue does not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they already contain the fix. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0481.html>.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=796829#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-23 21:49:26 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/02/23/5>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=796829#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-17 18:56:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0481 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0481.html>   ``` |  |

block: Fix io\_context leak after clone with CLONE\_IO

```
With CLONE_IO, copy_io() increments both ioc->refcount and ioc->nr_tasks.
However exit_io_context() only decrements ioc->refcount if ioc->nr_tasks
reaches 0.

Always call put_io_context() in exit_io_context().

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=798293#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-28 14:52:04 UTC  ``` The cifs code will attempt to open files on lookup under certain circumstances. What happens though if we find that the file we opened was actually a FIFO or other special file? Currently, the open filehandle just ends up being leaked leading to a dentry refcount mismatch and oops on umount.  An user with access to samba share could use this flaw to crash the systems of users that have access to the same samba share.  Introduced by: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/a6ce4932fbdbcd8f8e8c6df76812014351c32892>  Proposed upstream patch: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cifs/5526>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=798293#c4)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-28 15:11:44 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not backport the commit  a6ce4932fbdbcd8f8e8c6df76812014351c32892 that introduced this issue. This issue did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

# USN-1408-1: Linux kernel (FSL-IMX51) vulnerability

27 March 2012

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-fsl-imx51](/security/cves?package=linux-fsl-imx51) - Linux kernel for IMX51

## Details

Louis Rilling discovered a flaw in Linux kernel's clone command when

CLONE\_IO is specified. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to

cause a denial of service.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.31-612-imx51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-fsl-imx51)
  -
  [2.6.31-612.34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-fsl-imx51/2.6.31-612.34)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.
