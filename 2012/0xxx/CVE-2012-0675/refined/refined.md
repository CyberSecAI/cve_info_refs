- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Time Machine did not enforce the use of SRP-based authentication for subsequent backup operations, even if the backup destination (Time Capsule or AirPort Base Station) supported it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of mandatory SRP-based authentication mechanism for Time Machine backups.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could potentially gain access to a user's Time Capsule credentials by spoofing the remote volume. While backup data is not directly exposed, the compromised credentials could lead to further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Spoofing a remote AFP volume used for Time Machine backups.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to spoof a remote volume that the user's Time Machine is configured to connect to.
