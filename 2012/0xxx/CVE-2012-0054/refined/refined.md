Subject: CVE-request: golismero symlink vulnerability

User-triggered update-mechanism is vulnerable to symlink-attack in all GoLismero-versions before revision 2b3bb43d6867. Vulnerable code was in ./libs/updater.py, which I rewrote.

Vulnerable versions:
- GoLISMERO_last.zip (Nov 14, 2011)
- GoLISMERO_v0.6.3.zip (Nov 9, 2011)
- All Git-revisions before 2b3bb43d6867

Reported to author: 2011-11-17
Fixed by me: 2012-01-17
Link to the commit: <http://code.google.com/p/golismero/source/detail?r=2b3bb43d68676efd687361f7de29380189031ab8>

I fixed this, because developer had lack of time. I am asking for CVE, because this software is used in backtrack where golismero is executed as root-user.

Should get 2012 ID as this was publicly announced 2012-01-17. I haven't read all the code yet so there might be other issues too. I am not the original developer, but helped a bit after I found this vulnerability.

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The user-triggered update mechanism in GoLismero is vulnerable to a symlink attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The `updater.py` script, used for updates, is susceptible to symlink attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially overwrite arbitrary files on the system if the vulnerable update mechanism is triggered, especially when GoLismero is run with root privileges (as is the case in Backtrack).

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could create a malicious symlink which points to an attacker controlled file path. When the update mechanism is executed, it could overwrite files outside the intended directory with attacker controlled content.
- The vulnerability is triggered by the user-initiated update process within GoLismero.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to influence the update mechanism by creating malicious symlinks in the location from which the update is performed.
- No specific network position is mentioned, but the attacker likely needs some degree of local or filesystem access to influence the location of symlinks before the update process is initiated.
- The impact is increased if the application is run with root privileges, as is the case when using GoLismero in Backtrack.
