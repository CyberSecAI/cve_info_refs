# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: CVE-request: golismero symlink vulnerability

User-triggered update-mechanism is vulnerable to symlink-attack in all GoLismero-versions before revision 2b3bb43d6867. Vulnerable code was in ./libs/updater.py, which I rewrote.

Vulnerable versions:
- GoLISMERO_last.zip (Nov 14, 2011)
- GoLISMERO_v0.6.3.zip (Nov 9, 2011)
- All Git-revisions before 2b3bb43d6867

Reported to author: 2011-11-17
Fixed by me: 2012-01-17
Link to the commit: <http://code.google.com/p/golismero/source/detail?r=2b3bb43d68676efd687361f7de29380189031ab8>

I fixed this, because developer had lack of time. I am asking for CVE, because this software is used in backtrack where golismero is executed as root-user.

Should get 2012 ID as this was publicly announced 2012-01-17. I haven't read all the code yet so there might be other issues too. I am not the original developer, but helped a bit after I found this vulnerability.
