Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-0882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the yaSSL library's authentication portion, specifically related to SSL certificate-based authentication of clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in yaSSL, which can be triggered during SSL certificate-based authentication of clients.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** A successful exploit could lead to remote code execution due to the buffer overflow, as indicated by a "remote 0-day exploit".
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the exploit fails, it can cause a denial-of-service condition, forcing a restart of the MySQL service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is remote, meaning it can be initiated over a network connection.
- **Target:** The target is MySQL servers that use yaSSL for SSL certificate-based client authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to connect to the vulnerable MySQL server over the network.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious SSL authentication request to trigger the yaSSL buffer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported as a MySQL 0-day exploit found in VulnDisco Pack Professional 9.17.
- The vulnerability was determined to be within the yaSSL library and not MySQL itself.
- Red Hat stated that their MySQL packages were not affected because they use OpenSSL and not yaSSL for SSL/TLS.
