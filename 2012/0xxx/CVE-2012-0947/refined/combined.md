Package        : ffmpeg
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3892 CVE-2011-3893 CVE-2011-3895 CVE-2011-3929
                 CVE-2011-3936 CVE-2011-3940 CVE-2011-3947 CVE-2012-0853
                 CVE-2012-0947

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg, a multimedia
player, server and encoder. Multiple input validations in the decoders/
demuxers for Westwood Studios VQA, Apple MJPEG-B, Theora, Matroska,
Vorbis, Sony ATRAC3, DV, NSV, files could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

These issues were discovered by Aki Helin, Mateusz Jurczyk, Gynvael
Coldwind, and Michael Niedermayer.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.8-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6:0.8.2-1 of libav.

We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.

Subject: Security issue in libav/ffmpeg

A heap corruption security bug[1] was reported by Fabian Yamaguchi
against libav in Ubuntu. This issue also affected ffmpeg.

This issue is now public and has been assigned CVE-2012-0947.

Attached is a patch from upstream libav to fix the issue (thanks to Måns
Rullgård). While the issue also affected ffmpeg, upstream ffmpeg fixed
this some time ago in 3583c8706df0abbfa3ecdd6730f4f3d72a01fe6d.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-0858](/security/CVE-2012-0858))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed Vorbis

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Vorbis file, an

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libavformat52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ffmpeg)
  -
  [4:0.5.9-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ffmpeg/4%3A0.5.9-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [libavcodec52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ffmpeg)
  -
  [4:0.5.9-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/ffmpeg/4%3A0.5.9-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

This update uses a new upstream release of Libav, which includes additional

bug fixes. In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary

changes.

### Bug Description

A vulnerability in the decoder for VQA media files exists in function vqa\_decode\_chunk (libavcodec/vqavideo.c) of libavcodec (part of FFmpeg). This vulnerability allows memory on the heap to be corrupted and possibly leads o arbitrary code execution.

Here's the relevant excerpt from vqa\_decode\_chunk:

1 int lobytes = 0;

2 int hibytes = s->decode\_buffer\_size / 2;

3 ...

4 for (y = 0; y < s->frame.linesize[0] \* s->height;

5 y += s->frame.linesize[0] \* s->vector\_height) {

6

7 for (x = y; x < y + s->width; x += 4, lobytes++, hibytes++) {

8 pixel\_ptr = x;

9 /\* get the vector index, the method for which varies according to

10 \* VQA file version \*/

11 switch (s->vqa\_version) {

12 case 1:

13 ...

14 case 2:

15 lobyte = s->decode\_buffer[lobytes];

16 hibyte = s->decode\_buffer[hibytes];

17 vector\_index = (hibyte << 8) | lobyte;

18 vector\_index <<= index\_shift;

19 lines = s->vector\_height;

20 break;

21

22 case 3:

23 ...

24 }

25 while (lines--) {

26 s->frame.data[0][pixel\_ptr + 0] = s->codebook[vector\_index++];

27 s->frame.data[0][pixel\_ptr + 1] = s->codebook[vector\_index++];

28 s->frame.data[0][pixel\_ptr + 2] = s->codebook[vector\_index++];

29 s->frame.data[0][pixel\_ptr + 3] = s->codebook[vector\_index++];

30 pixel\_ptr += s->frame.linesize[0];

31 }

32 }

33 }

This function fills the pixel buffer (s->frame.data[0]) in tiles of 4x4 pixels on lines 25 to 30. The problem is that a check to verify that the index still addresses a location inside the buffer is performed only by the conditions of the for-loops on line 4 and 7, however, for the inner while-loop starting on line 25, no such check exists. In consequence, up to three extra lines can be written beyond the end of the buffer.

A sample file has been attached, which causes a crash on Ubuntu 11.10 (32 bit) when played with mplayer. We hope this information is useful to you.

Thank you for using Ubuntu and reporting a bug. I forwarded this to upstream. I can confirm the sample file crashes mplayer.

This also seems to affect ffmpeg from older releases. Upstream libav sent a suggested patch today, and I forwarded it and this information to upstream ffmpeg to linux-distros@.

Per upstream ffmpeg, this was fixed some time ago in 3583c8706df0abbfa3ecdd6730f4f3d72a01fe6d.

Per upstream libav, this issue is now public.
