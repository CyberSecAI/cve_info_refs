Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure SSL implementation in Cisco IronPort Web Security Appliance AsyncOS software. Specifically, it's due to the improper handling of cached SSL and Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. The system fails to adequately validate client-session traffic using these cached certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure SSL/TLS implementation
- Improper validation of client-session traffic
- Vulnerable caching of SSL/TLS certificates

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit enables an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform man-in-the-middle attacks. This allows the attacker to intercept and potentially modify communication between a user and a website, leading to data breaches, malware injection, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, via network access.
- The attacker injects a newly generated certificate into the server-side session of the targeted system.
- The attacker then convinces a user to visit a previously visited domain, establishing an SSL connection with that domain through the attacker's injected certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject a forged certificate to the vulnerable system.
- An attacker needs to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting or manipulating network traffic
- An attacker has to convince a target user to connect with a specific domain.
- No authentication is required to perform the attack.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered and reported to Cisco by Dell SecureWorks.
- The affected product is Cisco IronPort Web Security Appliance AsyncOS software.
- Versions prior to 7.5 are vulnerable.
- The provided CVSS v2 score is: AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C with a Base score of 4.3 and a Temporal score of 3.2.
- Cisco has released software updates to address the issue.
- Workarounds include applying software updates, using IP-based ACLs to restrict access, limiting network access to trusted users, and monitoring affected systems.
