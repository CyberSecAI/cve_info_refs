Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

>
>
> ## Introduction
>
> Cisco Unified Communications Manager, the call-processing component of the Cisco Unified Communications System, extends enterprise telephony features and capabilities to IP phones, media processing devices, voice-over-IP (VoIP) gateways, mobile devices, and multimedia applications.
>
> Cisco Unified Communications Manager Business Edition 5000 (Unified CMBE) offers you the features and functionality of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unity Connection on one appliance platform.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)In the past, export licenses, government regulations, and import restrictions have limited Cisco System's ability to supply Cisco Unified Communications Managers worldwide. Cisco has obtained an unrestricted US export classification for Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
>
> Be aware that after you install an unrestricted release, you can never upgrade to a restricted version. You will also not be allowed to fresh install a restricted version on a system that contains an unrestricted version.
>
> ---
>
>
>
>
> ## System Requirements
>
> The following sections comprise the system requirements for this release of Cisco Unified CM.
>
> Server Support
>
> Make sure that you install and configure Cisco Unified CM on a Cisco Media Convergence Server (MCS), a Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) server, or a Cisco-approved HP server configuration or a Cisco-approved IBM server configuration.
>
> To find which MCS and UCS servers are compatible with this release of Cisco Unified CM, refer to the Supported Servers for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Releases: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/voicesw/ps6790/ps5748/ps378/prod\_brochure0900aecd8062a4f9.html.

> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Make sure that the matrix shows that your server model supports Cisco Unified CM Release 8.5(1).
>
> ---
>
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Be aware that some servers that are listed in the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software Compatibility Matrix* may require additional hardware support for Cisco Unified CM Release 8.5(1). Make sure that your server meets the minimum hardware requirements, as indicated in the footnotes of the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software Compatibility Matrix*.
>
> ---
>
>
> Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) Integration for Cisco Unified Communications Manager
>
> Cisco recommends that you connect each Cisco Unified Communications Manager server to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to provide backup power and protect your system against a power failure.
>
> Integration occurs via a single point-to-point Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection. Serial and SNMP connectivity to UPS is not supported, and the USB connection must be point-to-point (in other words, no USB hubs). Single- and dual-USB UPS models get supported with the APC SmartUPS 1500VA USB and APC 750VA XL USB. The feature activates automatically during bootup if a connected UPS is detected.
>
> Alternatively, you can execute the CLI command **show ups status** that shows the current status of the USB-connected APC smart-UPS device and starts the monitoring service if it is not already started. The CLI command also displays detected hardware, detected versions, current power draw, remaining battery runtime, and other relevant status information.
>
> When the feature is activated, graceful shutdown will commence as soon as the low battery threshold is reached. Resumption or fluctuation of power will not interrupt or abort the shutdown, and administrators cannot stop the shutdown after the feature is activated.
>
> For unsupported Cisco Unified Communications Manager releases, MCS models and/or UPS vendor/make/models, you can cause an external script to monitor the UPS. When low battery gets detected, you can log on to Cisco Unified Communications Manager by using Secure Shell (SSH), access the CLI, and execute the **utils system shutdown** command.
>

>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If your pre-8.0 Unified CM runs on a deprecated server, you can upgrade it by using the Bridge upgrade procedure.

>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Be aware that the DL 380-G6 server is available only directly from HP; no equivalent HP OEM MCS-7835-H3 or MCS-7845-H3 servers exist.

>
>
>  **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Before you upgrade the software version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, verify your current software version.
>
> To do that, open Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration. The following information displays:
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco Unified Communications Manager System version
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration version
>
>  **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Read the ["Special Upgrade Information" section](#wp1834837).
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco recommends that you remove the bootable DVD from the DVD drive after an upgrade. If you reboot your system with the bootable DVD in the drive, your disk may be reformatted. At the completion of the upgrade, the DVD ejects. Confirm that the DVD ejected and remove the DVD physically from the DVD drive.

>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When you upgrade the Cisco Unified Communication Manager cluster, you must restart the Cisco Unified Mobility Advantage server to ensure it can register mobile clients.
>
> ---
>
>
>
>
> ### Special Upgrade Information
>
> The following sections include information that you must know before you begin the upgrade process.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Device Name of Cisco Unified Mobile Communicator Must Not Exceed 15 Characters Before Upgrade](#wp1365979)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Important Upgrade Information](#wp1896665)
>
>
>
> ### Device Name of Cisco Unified Mobile Communicator Must Not Exceed 15 Characters Before Upgrade
>
> Before you upgrade to Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.5(1), ensure that the device name of a Cisco Unified Mobile Communicator does not exceed 15 characters in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration. If the device name of a Cisco Unified Mobile Communicator exceeds 15 characters, migration of this device will fail when you upgrade to Cisco Unified Communications Manager8.5(1) and the following error message gets written to the upgrade log:
>
>
> ```
> InstallFull *ERROR* Name for Cisco Unified Mobile Communicator device(s) must be 15 or
> less, please correct and rerun upgrade.
>
> ```
>
> If an existing Cisco Unified Mobile Communicator device name specifies a longer name, shorten the device name to 15 or fewer characters before the upgrade.
>
>
>
> ### Important Upgrade Information
>
> Do not upgrade Cisco Unified Communications Manager Business Edition 5000 at the same time that the Cisco Unity Connection "Upgrade Database Statistics" task is running. Because both processes are processor intensive, allowing them to run simultaneously may cause the system to stop functioning and force you to restart the server.
>
> By default, the Upgrade Database Statistics task runs at 3:30 am daily. To determine whether the task schedule has been changed, whether the task is currently running, and how long the task has recently taken to complete, log on to Cisco Unity Connection Administration.Click **Tools > Task Management > Update Database Statistics**.
>
> The Task Definition Basics window displays a history of when the task started and when it completed. If the Time Started column has a value and the Time Completed column does not, this indicates that the task is currently running.
>
> If you must run the upgrade at a time that could overlap with the Upgrade Database Statistics task, reschedule the task to run before or after the upgrade. On the Task Definition Basics window for the task, click **Edit > Task Schedule**.
>
> Do not reschedule the task to run during normal business hours. When the upgrade completes, reset the schedule to the default settings.
>
>
>
>
> ### Upgrade Paths
>
> For information about supported Cisco Unified CM upgrades, see the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager Software Compatibility Matrix* at the following URL:
>
> [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice\_ip\_comm/cucm/compat/ccmcompmatr.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/compat/ccmcompmatr.html)
>
>
>
> ### Ordering the Upgrade Media
>
> To upgrade to Cisco Unified CM Release 8.5(1) from a release prior to 8.0(1), use the [Product Upgrade Tool](//tools.cisco.com/gct/Upgrade/jsp/index.jsp) (PUT) to obtain a media kit and license or purchase the upgrade from Cisco Sales.
>
> To use the PUT, you must enter your Cisco contract number (Smartnet, SASU or ESW) and request the DVD/DVD set. If you do not have a contract for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, you must purchase the upgrade from Cisco Sales.

> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Because the UCSInstall\_UCOS\_8.5.1.10000-26 build specifies a nonbootable ISO, the build proves useful only for upgrades. You cannot use this build for new installations.

> ### Installing the Unrestricted COP File
>
> Before you upgrade from [Compatible Versions](#wp1894127) of Cisco Unified Communications Manager 5.1(3x), 6.x or 7.x to unrestricted Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.5(1), install the unrestricted COP file (ciscocm.allow\_upgrades\_to\_unrestricted.cop.sgn) that you can find under:
>
> Cisco Unified Communications Manager Version 8.5 -> Unified Communications Manager / CallManager / Cisco Unity Connection Utilities -> COP-Files
>
>
> Compatible Versions
>
>
> To see if your current version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager is compatible with the unrestricted version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.5(1), see [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice\_ip\_comm/cucm/compat/ccmcompmatr.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/compat/ccmcompmatr.html)

> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[CSCsz18443 Cisco Unified IP Phone 8961, 9951, 9971 Registered to a Node may Use the Call Park Number Assigned to Another Node](#wp1849665)

>
> ### CSCsz18443 Cisco Unified IP Phone 8961, 9951, 9971 Registered to a Node may Use the Call Park Number Assigned to Another Node
>
> Call Park numbers get configured on the nodes of a Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster (first/subsequent). Call Park numbers are normally allocated from the node that initiates the call. If the Cisco Unified IP Phone 8961, 9951, 9971 that initiates the call is registered to the first node of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster, then a Call Park number configured on the first node gets used to park the call. This is irrespective of the node to which the called party is registered, or which party (calling or called) invokes the Call Park feature.
>
> For example, if a phone registered to the first node initiates a call to a phone registered to the second node, then regardless of which phone invokes the Call Park feature, a Call Park number configured on the first node is always used.
>
> Similarly, if the Call Park feature gets invoked when a phone in the second node is the call initiator, then a Call Park number configured on the second node is used.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Be aware that you can restrict the Call Park feature only by using calling search space and partitions. Not configuring a Call Park number on a node will not ensure that the Call Park feature is not available to the phones in that node.

>
>
>
>
> ### CSCsz31137 Parked Call Gets Reverted When the Parkee is on
>
> When an inter-cluster parked call connected by an Intercluster Trunk (ICT) is put on hold, the call reverts when the Park Monitoring Reversion Timer and the Park Monitoring Forward No Retrieve Timer expire. Such a call reverts even though the parkee is on hold. This is a known limitation of inter-cluster calls connected via ICT that use the Call Park feature.

> For inter-cluster parked called connected by an ICT, after the Park Reversion Timer and Park Monitoring Forward No Retrieve Timer expire, the call gets forwarded to the Park Monitoring Forward No Retrieve destination. The display of the incoming call is incorrect on the destination device.
>
> The display on the device is "From DN" instead of "Forwarded for DN". For example, if the initial call is an inter-cluster call via ICT from DN 1000 to DN 3000 and gets forwarded to DN 2000, the display on DN 2000 is "From 3000" instead of "Forwarded for 1000".
>
>
>
> ### CSCtb53159 Display Limitation in ConfList
>
> You can add as many conference participants as the conference bridge supports; however, ConfList only displays 16 participants. From the 17th participant onwards, the list displays only the latest 16 participants.

>
> After you use the recovery disk to bring a server with a corrupted file system into a bootable and semi-functional state, Cisco recommends that you rebuild the server.

> ### CSCte05285 IBM I3 Servers Automatic Server Restart (ASR) Default Specifies Disabled
>
> In the event of a system lockup, IBM I3 type servers do not automatically restart.
>
> Under rare critical failures, such as a kernel panic, the IBM I3 type platforms do not automatically get restarted by the BIOS ASR functionality. The server remains unresponsive until it is rebooted manually.
>
> Condition
>
> In **IMM Control > System Settings > Server Timeouts**, the OS Watchdog timeout default specifies disabled.
>
> Workaround
>
> Before you perform the workaround make sure that the following conditions exist:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco Unified CM install is complete and the system is operational
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)IMM remote management web interface is configured. (For details on how to configure IMM, refer to the hardware documentation.)
>
> Procedure
>
> To change the OS Watchdog configuration setting:
>
>  **1.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Log into the IMM remote management web interface.
>
>  **2.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)From **IMM Control > System Settings > Server Timeouts**, change the OS Watchdog timeout value to **04:00**. This configures the timeout to 4 minutes.

> ### CSCtd01766 Destination Port on Trunk Remains Unchanged After Upgrade
>
> During an upgrade to an unrestricted Cisco Unified CM release, the SIP trunk incoming port gets changed to 5060; however, the destination port on the trunk remains what it was before the upgrade.
>
>
>
>
>
> ### Disaster Recovery System Caution
>
> When you restore your data, the hostname, server IP address, and the deployment type must be the same as it was during the backup. DRS does not restore across different hostnames, IP addresses and deployment types.
>
>
>
> ### EMCC Login Affects Settings in Product-Specific Configuration Layout of Phone Configuration Window
>
> When a user uses a phone in a visiting cluster to log into the user Extension Mobility profile, the phone inherits the default provisioning, network, and security settings (specifically, the configuration in the Product Specific Configuration Layout section of the Phone Configuration window) from the home cluster. This behavior may override local security and network settings that are in place in the visiting cluster. Some of the parameters have firmware defaults that the system administrator cannot change until a fix is provided.

> Understanding the Fixed-in Version Field in the Online Defect Record
>
> When you open the online record for a defect, you will see data in the "First Fixed-in Version" field. The information that displays in this field identifies the list of Cisco Unified Communications Manager interim versions in which the defect was fixed. These interim versions then get integrated into Cisco Unified Communications Manager releases.
>
> Some more clearly defined versions include identification for Engineering Specials (ES) or Service Releases (SR); for example 03.3(04)ES29 and 04.0(02a)SR1. However, the version information that displays for the Cisco Unified Communications Manager maintenance releases may not be as clearly identified.
>
> The following examples show how you can decode the maintenance release interim version information. These examples show you the format of the interim version along with the corresponding Cisco Unified Communications Manager release that includes that interim version. You can use these examples as guidance to better understand the presentation of information in these fields.

> ### Updated Field Descriptions
>
> The Trunk Configuration Settings topic in Cisco Unified Communications Manager online help contains an incorrect description of the Parameter Name/Parameter Value field. The updated description is provided below and exists in the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration Guide* on Cisco.com.
>
> Optionally, enter parameter names and parameter values. Valid values include all characters except equal sign (=), semi-colon (;), and non-printable characters, such as tabs. You can enter a parameter name with no value.
>
> **Example**
>
> **Parameter Name Parameter Value**
>
> CCA-ID 11223344
>
> pbx
>
> location RTP
>
> You must choose a script from the Normalization Script drop-down list box before you can enter parameter names and values. To add another parameter line, click the + (plus) button. To delete a parameter line, click the - (minus) button.
>
>
>
> ### Hub\_None Information
>
> The "Location Configuration" chapter of the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration Guide* omits the following information:
>
> The location that is configured in a device pool takes precedence over the location configured in the device when the location in the device is set to Hub\_None. If the device location is set to any other user-defined location, standard rules apply and the device parameter takes priority.
>
>
>
> ### Agent Greeting
>
> The Phone Features section of the "Cisco Unified IP Phones" chapter of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager System Guide omits the following information:
>
> Agent Greeting enables Cisco Unified Communications Manager to automatically play a pre-recorded announcement following a successful media connection to the agent device. The greeting helps keep agents sounding fresh because they do not have to repeat common phrases on each call. Agent Greeting is audible for the agent and the customer.
>
> If you want to use agent greeting, Built-in Bridge must be On.
>
>
>
> ### Whisper Coaching
>
> The Phone Features section of the "Cisco Unified IP Phones" chapter of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager System Guide omits the following information:
>
> Silent call monitoring is a feature that allows a supervisor to discreetly listen to a conversation between an agent and a customer without allowing the agent to detect the monitoring session. Whisper coaching is an enhancement to the Silent call monitoring feature that allows supervisors to talk to agents during a monitoring session. This feature allows applications to change the current monitoring mode of a monitoring call from Silent Monitoring to Whisper Coaching and vice versa.
>
>
>
> ### Incorrect Document Reference
>
> The *Cisco Unified Communications Manager System Guide* contains incorrect references to the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager SIP Transparency and Normalization Guide*. The references should be to the *Developer Guide for SIP Transparency and Normalization Guide*.
>
>
>
> ### Suggested MaxConcurrentCallRequests (MCCR) Value
>
> The Setting Service Parameters for the Webdialer Servlet section of the "Cisco WebDialer" chapter of the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager Features and Services Guide* incorrectly states:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)MCS 7845H2 supports a maximum of 4 calls per second. Cisco recommends setting the MaxConcurrentCallRequests (MCCR) value to 6 to allow callers to initiate and disconnect calls as needed.
>
> The correct information is:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)MCS 7845H2 supports a maximum of 4 calls per second. Cisco recommends setting the MaxConcurrentCallRequests (MCCR) value to 8 to allow callers to initiate and disconnect calls as needed.
>
> The same section contains the following information:
>
> The maximum value specifies 6.
>
> The correct information is:
>
> The maximum value specifies 8.
>
>
>
> ### Setting the Service Parameters for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Assistant
>
> The Setting the Service Parameters for Cisco Unified Communications Manager Assistant section of the "Cisco Unified Communications Manager Assistant With Shared Line Support" and "Cisco Unified Communications Manager Assistant With Proxy Line Support" chapters of the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager Features and Services Guide* omits the following information.
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure unique IP addresses for each pool so that the same Cisco IPMA server IP address does not appear in more than one pool.
>
> ---
>
>
>
>
> ### Intercom Directory Number Configuration Settings Auto Answer Field is Incorrect
>
> In the Intercom Directory Number Configuration Settings section of the "Intercom" chapter of the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager Features and Services Guide*, the Auto Answer field description includes an option that no longer exists.
>
> The Auto Answer Off <*Default*> option is no longer available.
>
>
>
> ### Secure Extension Mobility
>
> The following information is missing from the "Cisco Extension Mobility" and "Cisco Extension Mobility Cross Cluster" chapters in the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager Features and Services Guide*
>
> The Extension Mobility HTTPS Support feature ensures that when communications are exchanged between a Cisco Unified IP Phone service and other applications, that the communications use the HTTPS protocol to ensure that the communications are secure. Users must log into the Cisco Unified CM applications by providing their authentication information. Their credentials are encrypted after the communication protocol changes to HTTPS.
>
> When a visiting Extension Mobility (EM) application fails to locate a user's identification in the local database, the following occurs:
>
>  **3.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco Extension Mobility Cross Cluster (EMCC) sends a request to the local EM service to determine the home cluster of that user (the cluster which owns the user's identification, and which can handle the EM login).
>
>  **4.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The visiting EM service sends a user identification message over HTTPS to all the remote clusters added in the local database.
>
>  **5.** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The visiting EM service then parses the response received from the home cluster to get the list of device profiles associated with that user.
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)All further communication between the visiting EM service and home EM service takes place over HTTPS.
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Similarly, visiting logout requests are also sent from the home EM service to the visiting EM service over HTTPS.
>
> The Extension Mobility HTTPS Support feature is supported on the following IP phones (SIP):
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco Unified IP Phone 8961
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco Unified IP Phone 9951
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco Unified IP Phone 9971
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configure Cisco Extension Mobility on Cisco Unified IP Phones before configuring EMCC.
>
> ---
>
>
>
>
> ### Cisco Unified Serviceability
>
> The following changes exist for Cisco Unified Serviceability documentation.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Trace Compression](#wp1849995)
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Wrong Login URL Included in CAR Documentation](#wp1848923)
>
>
>
> ### Trace Compression
>
> The Trace Configuration and Collection Checklist section of the "Understanding Trace" chapter of the *Cisco Unified Serviceability Administration Guide* contains incorrect information regarding trace compression. The correct information follows:
>
> You cannot enable or disable trace compression from an enterprise parameter, the user interface (UI) or the command line interface (CLI).
>
>
>
> ### Wrong Login URL Included in CAR Documentation
>
> The Logging On to CAR section of the "Configuring the CDR Analysis and Reporting Tool" chapter of the *Cisco Unified Communications Manager CDR Analysis and Reporting Administration Guide* contains an incorrect link for logging on to CAR. The correct URL is:
>
> **https://<Server-ip/name>:8443/car/**
>
>
>
>
