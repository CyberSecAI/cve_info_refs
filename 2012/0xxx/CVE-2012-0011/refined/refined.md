Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer accesses objects that have been deleted from memory. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free condition where the browser attempts to access a memory location that has already been deallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the logged-on user.
    - If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
    - This control allows for actions like installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content or ads.
- **Embedded Malicious Content:** The exploit could be delivered by embedding an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" within an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine
- **Email/Instant Messenger:** Attackers can trick users into clicking malicious links in emails or instant messages, leading them to attacker-controlled websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host malicious content:** An attacker needs the capability to host a specially crafted webpage, or inject malicious content into a website or document.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious content.

**Additional Information:**
- Microsoft's advisory states that this vulnerability was not publicly known or exploited when the bulletin was released.
- The update addresses this vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The Exploitability Index from Microsoft categorized this vulnerability with a high risk rating.
- The advisory also discusses workarounds such as disabling Active Scripting or setting the security level to High which could help to mitigate the vulnerability but these may cause issues with website functionality.
