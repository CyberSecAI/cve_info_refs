  "CVE-2012-0136": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Visio Viewer validates attributes when handling specially crafted Visio files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Visio Viewer handles memory when parsing specially crafted Visio files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper validation of attributes when handling Visio files."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user, potentially gaining complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Email: Sending a specially crafted Visio file to a user and convincing them to open it.",
      "Web-based attack: Hosting a website containing a specially crafted Visio file and convincing users to visit the site and open the file."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted Visio file."
