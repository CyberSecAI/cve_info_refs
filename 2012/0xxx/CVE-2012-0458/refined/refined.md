{
  "CVE-2012-0458": {
    "description": "An attacker able to convince a potential victim to set a new home page by dragging a link to the 'home' button can set that user's home page to a javascript: URL. Once this is done the attacker's page can cause repeated crashes of the browser, eventually getting the script URL loaded in the privileged about:sessionrestore context.",
    "vulnerability": "The home button accepted JavaScript links to set the browser home page.",
    "impact": "An attacker could use this vulnerability to get the script URL loaded in the privileged about:sessionrestore context or cause repeated crashes of the browser, eventually leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.",
     "attack_vector": "A user can be convinced to drag a javascript: link to the 'home' button in the browser, thus setting the home page to this malicious link.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick the user into dragging a link onto the home button.",
      "root_cause": "The browser does not properly validate the URI scheme when setting the home page via drag and drop, which allows the use of javascript: URLs."
