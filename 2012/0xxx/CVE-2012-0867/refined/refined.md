Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-0867:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of the Common Name (CN) field within X.509 certificates during SSL/TLS handshake in PostgreSQL. Specifically, the server and client implementations (libpq) truncated the CN value at 32 bytes, rather than considering the full name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** The vulnerability stems from the inadequate validation of the server's SSL certificate. By truncating the CN field at 32 bytes, the system failed to properly compare the full name, making it possible to bypass proper name checks.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Potential:** By using a rogue server, with a carefully crafted certificate, an attacker could potentially impersonate a valid server and conduct a MITM attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Connection Spoofing:** An attacker could potentially impersonate a legitimate server to the client.
*   **Data Theft and Manipulation:** By intercepting the connection, the attacker may be able to steal or manipulate data.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** In conjunction with other exploits or vulnerabilities, a successful MITM attack could lead to further unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based MITM:** The primary attack vector involves network-based attacks. An attacker would need to be positioned between the client and the server to intercept the connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept the network traffic between the PostgreSQL client and server.
*   **Malicious Certificate:** The attacker must have a valid certificate issued by a CA that is trusted by the PostgreSQL client where the CN begins with a 32-character prefix matching the target server's actual CN, but could otherwise have a different name.
*   **Redirection of Client Connections:** The attacker would also likely require some additional exploit to redirect client connections to the rogue server.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The issue was found in both libpq client library and the PostgreSQL server, with both truncating the CN to 32 bytes.
*   The vulnerability requires a specific setup for successful exploitation: the victim's common name in the certificate must be exactly 32 characters long, and the attacker must be able to get a certificate signed by a trusted CA using that 32 character string as a prefix for the malicious CN.
*   The vulnerability affects PostgreSQL versions 8.4 and later, as support for SSL certificate verification using the common name has been added in those versions. PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.4 are not affected by the CN validation issue.

**Mitigation:**

The primary mitigation was to remove the arbitrary 32-byte limit for the common name field. This fix was included in the following PostgreSQL versions: 9.1.3, 9.0.7, 8.4.11, and 8.3.18, and users were encouraged to upgrade immediately.
