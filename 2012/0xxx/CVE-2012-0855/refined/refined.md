Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a missing check for the validity of the `curtileno` variable in the `j2kdec` decoder. Specifically, the code fails to verify if `curtileno` is within the bounds of the related array before using it as an index.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing bounds check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of a check to ensure that `curtileno` is a valid index for the array being accessed. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read or write.
*   **Integer overflow** is not directly mentioned, but the check is missing to determine validity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash/Segmentation Fault:** The most immediate impact of this vulnerability is a crash or segmentation fault. The program attempts to access memory outside of the allocated array bounds, which typically results in abnormal termination.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** Although not explicitly mentioned in this context, out-of-bounds accesses can sometimes be leveraged for more serious attacks like arbitrary code execution, but the details provided do not describe this possibility for this specific case.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted J2K (JPEG 2000) file. The attacker has to provide a specially crafted input file.
*  The `j2k` decoder is marked as experimental, meaning a user application has to enable it which would require some knowledge of the application in use to determine if this vulnerability is exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted J2K file that can be processed by FFmpeg.
*   The attacker needs to know if the user application using the affected version of FFmpeg enables the experimental J2K decoder.
*   The attacker can be a remote or local user depending on the context of how FFmpeg is used.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `j2kdec` decoder is marked as experimental which can limit the attack surface and exploitation in the wild if this decoder is not enabled by default in the user application.
*  The provided information mentions "simple missing check for index and array size", which could mean there might be more similar instances that would potentially lead to other crashes.
