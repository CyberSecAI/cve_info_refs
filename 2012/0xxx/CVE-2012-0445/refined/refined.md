This is the same behavior as the current version of Chrome.\nI'm setting this as moderate severity, because most high bugs involve stealing information or running script in the context of another site, but this is still bad. You could easily use this to spoof the content in another site if you know the name of an iframe there. I could be persuaded that this is in fact a high bug.",
