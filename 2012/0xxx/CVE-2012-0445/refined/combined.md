# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-03

## <iframe> element exposed across domains via name attribute

Announced
January 31, 2012
Reporter
Vitaly Nevgen
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 10
* SeaMonkey 2.7
* Thunderbird 10

### Description

**Vitaly Nevgen** reported that an attacker could replace a
sub-frame in another domain's document by using the name attribute of the
sub-frame as a form submission target. This can potentially allow for phishing
attacks against users and violates the HTML5 frame navigation policy.

Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=701071#c0)• 13 years ago |
|  | |

Alex Dvorov reported this to security@m.o:
A form can be submitted to a named iframe in another domain if you know the name attribute of the iframe element.
This is a regression, as Firefox 3.6 creates a new top-level window to which the form is submitted if the named iframe doesn't exist within the current window. This is the same behavior as the current version of Chrome.
I'm setting this as moderate severity, because most high bugs involve stealing information or running script in the context of another site, but this is still bad. You could easily use this to spoof the content in another site if you know the name of an iframe there. I could be persuaded that this is in fact a high bug.

> I thought we had mochitests for this when we fixed it last time
Hmm. I believe at the time there was no way to sanely write tests for it, but I'll check.
In any case, what's happening is that the GetSubjectPrincipal call in nsDocShell::ValidateOrigin is finding the system principal, not null as it should for the form submit case. And it treats the two differently.
And the reason GetSubjectPrincipal does that is that nsScriptSecurityManager::GetPrincipalAndFrame extracts an nsJSContext from the |cx| which has an nsGlobalChromeWindow as its GetObjectPrincipal.
The callstack at this point has no JS running on it, but does have the click event dispatch that triggers the form submission...
Is a non-null subject principal actually expected in this situation? If so, why?

where is the testcase?
Why do we get non-null principal if JS is not running o\_O. XPConnect should push
null cx.

> where is the testcase?
The testcase I used looks like this:
On server ZZZZ I put this file, named iframe.html:
<iframe name="x"></iframe>
On server B (file:// in my case), I put this file:
<form action="<http://www.mozilla.org>" target="x">
<input type="submit">
</form>
<iframe src="<http://ZZZZ/iframe.html>"></iframe>
Then clicked the submit button.
> Why do we get non-null principal if JS is not running
I \_think\_ that dispatch of the click event pushes the cx of the chrome window or something. I didn't get a chance to debug more in detail yet.

But click is happening in content, right? It should push the cx of content window.

..for event listeners. But for default handling there shouldn't be a context pushed, or, again,
the context of the page.

That's not a testcase; that's a video. A testcase would be a web page showing the problem.
Olli, per our IRC conversation, over to you. Looks like the issue is that we RePush when calling nsEventListenerManager::HandleEventInternal on the tabbrowser and pop too late.

So the patch does change principal handling. nsDocShell::ValidateOrigin gets
null principal and not system principal. But the behavior is still the same.

Would be great if you could upload your test using "Add an attachment", since apparently
I have a different kind of testcase (the one from Boris) which is actually broken also in FF3.6.

works the same way in Gecko, Webkit and IE.

Make sure we pop cx from stack when doing default handling.
This is a regression from year 2009.

There won't be 8.1, and I doubt this can make to 8.0.\*, since this isn't \*critical\* security bug.
But I hope FF9, at latest. That will be released before Christmas.

Обычно, здесь лучше писать по английски, чтобы все понимали...
Патч естъ. Его нужно проверить, потом добавитъ в FF 11, потом скорее всего в 10 и 9.
В 8.0.\* этот патч скорее всего не попадет потому, что это не критический баг (пример критического бага -- возможность запускать на компьютере пользователя произвольный код).

For the rest, what happened above is Alex said that he's glad someone understands Russian; he'd thought that he would have to stick to English here. He then asked whether he understands correctly that there is a patch and all that's left is to add it to the next FF 8.0.\*.
What I said is basically a repeat of [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=701071#c25 "VERIFIED FIXED - <iframe> element is exposed across domains by its name attribute"), but in Russian, along with an example of what we consider a critical security bug (remote code execution).

Olli, can you explain the rationale here and what exactly is going wrong here?

We end up having wrong cx (chrome) on js stack when doing PostHandleEvent (which ends up submitting
the form).
This is a regression from the work where the number of push/pop calls were tried to be reduced.

Sorry - fishing.
We can change all page containing iframe element, if page that was be in iframe, contains
<script>top.location.href = "<http://google.com/>";</script>

The frame targeting issue has been considered sg:moderate in the past (e.g. <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2005/mfsa2005-51.html> ) but it's possible we've learned better how to exploit it.
But having the wrong cx on the stack ([comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=701071#c36 "VERIFIED FIXED - <iframe> element is exposed across domains by its name attribute")) sounds like it might lead to much worse (or not?). CC'ing moz\_bug\_r\_a4 in case this inspires him.

2. Opened index.html in tab #1
3. Opened index2.html in tab #2
4. Select the POST button in index2.html
Expected:
The text in index.html should not change.

The text in index.html did change.

On different servers? The bug report is about the case when index.html is on one server and index2.html is on another one. See [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=701071#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - <iframe> element is exposed across domains by its name attribute").

My test cases were both executed on the same server. I can retest that with separate servers.
However, I want to know if that test case I used is allowed where index.html and index2.html are hosted on the same server. If it isn't, then there's still a problem.

If they're on the same server, they should be able to link to each other at the moment.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

openSUSE Security Update: MozillaFirefox: Version 10

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes 5 new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 10 to fix bugs and
security issues.
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in
the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is
disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or
browser-like contexts in those products. References
CVE-2012-0443: Ben Hawkes, Christian Holler, Honza Bombas,
Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, Jan Odvarko, Peter Van Der
Beken, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety problems
that were fixed in Firefox 10.
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported memory
safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10 and
Firefox 3.6.26.
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons Firefox
has been generous in its interpretation of web addresses
containing square brackets around the host. If this host
was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox attempted to
interpret the host as a regular domain name. Gregory
Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6 syntax
using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate
errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The
resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0, Thunderbird 7.0,
and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in Firefox 3.6.26 and
Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
MFSA 2012-03/CVE-2012-0445: Alex Dvorov reported that an
attacker could replace a sub-frame in another domain's
document by using the name attribute of the sub-frame as a
form submission target. This can potentially allow for
phishing attacks against users and violates the HTML5 frame
navigation policy.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher regenrecht
reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that
removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed under
certain circumstances because of a premature notification
of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free of the child
nodes could possibly allow for for remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-05/CVE-2012-0446: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that frame scripts bypass XPConnect
security checks when calling untrusted objects. This allows
for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages
and Firefox extensions. The fix enables the Script Security
Manager (SSM) to force security checks on all frame scripts.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-06/CVE-2012-0447: Mozilla developer Tim Abraldes
reported that when encoding images as
image/vnd.microsoft.icon the resulting data was always a
fixed size, with uninitialized memory appended as padding
beyond the size of the actual image. This is the result of
mImageBufferSize in the encoder being initialized with a
value different than the size of the source image. There is
the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized memory
being appended to a PNG image when converted fron an ICO
format image. This sensitive data may then be disclosed in
the resulting image.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher regenrecht
reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative the
possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of Ogg
Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding and
has the potential for remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers Nicolas
Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that when
processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet, Firefox
can crash due to a memory corruption. While there is no
evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is a
possibility of remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-09/CVE-2012-0450: magicant starmen reported that
if a user chooses to export their Firefox Sync key the
"Firefox Recovery Key.html" file is saved with incorrect
permissions, making the file contents potentially readable
by other users on Linux and OS X systems.
Firefox 3.6 is not affected by this vulnerability.
