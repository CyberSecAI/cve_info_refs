| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=787104#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-03 07:05:28 UTC  ```  Juraj Somorovsky reported that certain XML parsers/servers are affected by the same, or similar, flaw as the hash table collisions CPU usage denial of service.  Sending a specially crafted message to an XML service can result in longer processing time, which could lead to a denial of service.  It is reported that this attack on XML can be applied on different XML nodes (such as entities, element attributes, namespaces, various elements in the XML security, etc.).  xerces-j2 is written in Java and makes significant use of arrays.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=787104#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2015-01-17 04:45:11 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of xerces as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

# Summer bug cleaning - some Hash DoS stuff

Hash: SHA1

So in the spirit of cleaning out the fridge of mystery condiments I'm
going through a bunch of old/lower severity bugs that have been
lurking in our BZ. To start with some Hash DoS related stuff from 2012:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=787103>
CVE-2012-0880 xml: xerces-c hash table collisions CPU usage DoS
(oCERT-2011-003

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=787104>
 CVE-2012-0881 xml: xerces-j2 hash table collisions CPU usage DoS
(oCERT-2011-003)

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=787109>
CVE-2012-0877 PyXML: hash table collisions CPU usage DoS (oCERT-2011-003)

Basically different code bases/etc, but all using poor hash
implementations.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=787103#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-03 06:54:52 UTC  ``` Juraj Somorovsky reported that certain XML parsers/servers are affected by the same, or similar, flaw as the hash table collisions CPU usage denial of service.  Sending a specially crafted message to an XML service can result in longer processing time, which could lead to a denial of service.  It is reported that this attack on XML can be applied on different XML nodes (such as entities, element attributes, namespaces, various elements in the XML security, etc.).  xerces-c is written in C++ and makes significant use of arrays.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=787103#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2015-01-17 04:44:48 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of xerces as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |
