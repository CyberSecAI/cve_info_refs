Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0880:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from hash table collisions within the `xerces-c` XML parser. This occurs when specially crafted XML messages with numerous colliding hash values are sent to the parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hash Table Collision Vulnerability:** The `xerces-c` library utilizes a hash table for processing XML data. The hash function used to insert and retrieve elements in the hash table is susceptible to collisions. When a large number of XML nodes with the same hash values are processed, it leads to performance degradation due to increased time spent resolving collisions, essentially making lookups and insertion slow.
- **CPU Usage:** Processing these collisions results in excessive CPU consumption, potentially leading to a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by sending crafted XML messages that trigger hash table collisions, leading to increased CPU usage and ultimately making the service unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted XML Message:** The attack vector involves sending a malicious XML message to the vulnerable service that relies on `xerces-c`. The XML message is designed to contain elements that produce hash collisions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Send XML:** The attacker needs to be able to send XML data to a service that processes XML using the vulnerable `xerces-c` library.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable service.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as related to other similar "hash table collision CPU usage denial of service" issues, and is referenced as `oCERT-2011-003`.
- The issue is rated as having a "Moderate" security impact by Red Hat Product Security.
- The vulnerability affects versions of `xerces-c` shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
- The bug report mentions that the attack can target different XML nodes including "entities, element attributes, namespaces, various elements in the XML security, etc."

This information provides a comprehensive view of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-0880, focusing on hash table collisions within the `xerces-c` library leading to a denial-of-service.
