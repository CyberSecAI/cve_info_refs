```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow in the ospf_ls_upd_list_lsa function within the OSPFv2 implementation. The vulnerability arises because the function does not properly validate the length of a Link State Update (LS Update) packet. Specifically, the function does not check if the length of the received packet is smaller than specified in its header.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow due to improper length check.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service. The specific impact is an assertion failure leading to daemon exit. In some cases it can lead to a crash of OSPF protocol process and disruption of IPv4 routing
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted OSPFv2 LS Update packet with a smaller size than declared in its header.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable system through the OSPF protocol. The attacker needs to be on a local network segment with OSPF enabled and be able to form an OSPF adjacency with the target router and initiate a database exchange.
