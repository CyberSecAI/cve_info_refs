# Cognos TM1 9.5.2 Interim Fix 4

### Download

## Abstract

This Interim Fix will upgrade your IBM Cognos TM1 9.5.2 release.

## Download Description

The TM1 Admin Server does not check the size of the data being sent to it which could permit a remote malicious attacker to perform a "Buffer Overflow" attack against the server running this software. The exposures range from crashing the TM1 Admin Server process through to potentially inserting code of their design to run within the TM1 Admin Server Process.

While IBM has not received any reports of customer issues related to these security vulnerabilities as of March 30, 2012, we strongly encourage all customers to download and apply this Interim Fix to prevent the vulnerability.

## Installation Instructions

To install the Admin Server patch:
