| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.

| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

Affected versions of Cisco ASA Software will vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected version.      Cisco PIX Security Appliances may be affected by some of the vulnerabilities described in this security advisory. Cisco PIX has reached end of maintenance support. Cisco PIX Security Appliance customers are encouraged to migrate to Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. Consult the dedicated section for Cisco PIX Security Appliances in the "Vulnerable Products" section of this security advisory for more information about affected versions.   Vulnerable ProductsFor specific version information, refer to the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this advisory.Cisco ASA UDP Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability The Cisco ASA UDP inspection engine that is used to inspect UDP-based protocols contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to trigger a reload of the Cisco ASA.  All UDP protocols that are being inspected by the Cisco ASA UDP inspection engine may be vulnerable. The following protocols are known to use the Cisco ASA UDP inspection engine:    + Domain Name System (DNS)   + Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)   + Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)   + GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP)   + H.323, H.225 RAS   + Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)   + SunRPC   + Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)   + X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)   + IBM NetBios   + Instant Messaging (depending on the particular IM client/solution being used)   **Note:** UDP inspection engines may be enabled by default on Cisco ASA Software. Please consult your user guide for more information. The default inspected ports are listed at the following link: [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa84/configuration/guide/inspect\_overview.html](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa84/configuration/guide/inspect_overview.html#wp1536127)   **Note:** The Cisco ASA UDP inspection can be applied to non-default UDP ports via **class-map** and **policy-map** commands. Any instance of use of the Cisco ASA UDP inspection engines may be vulnerable to this vulnerability, thus, configurations that include non-default UDP ports but use the Cisco ASA UDP inspection engine are considered vulnerable. To determine whether any of the above inspections are enabled, issue the **show service-policy | include**  command and confirm that the command returns output. The following example shows a Cisco ASA configured to inspect IBM NetBIOS traffic: ```   ciscoasa# show service-policy | include netbios     Inspect: netbios, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0   ``` Cisco ASA Threat Detection Denial of Service Vulnerability The Cisco ASA Threat Detection feature, when configured with the Scanning Threat Mode feature and with *shun* option enabled, contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to trigger a reload of the Cisco ASA. This feature is not enabled by default. To determine whether the Cisco ASA Threat Detection with Scanning Threat feature and *shun* option is enabled, issue the s**how running-config threat-detection scanning-threat** command and confirm that the returned output includes the *shun* option. The following example shows a vulnerable configuration: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config threat-detection scanning-threat   threat-detection scanning-threat shun      ``` **Note:** This feature was first introduced in Cisco ASA Software Version 8.0(2), Previous versions of Cisco ASA are not vulnerable.      Cisco ASA Syslog Message 305006 Denial of Service Vulnerability A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the implementation of one specific system log (syslog) message (message ID 305006), that could cause a reload of the Cisco ASA if this syslog message needs to be generated.  Syslog message ID 305006 is generated when the Cisco ASA is unable to create a network address translation for a new connection. Additional information regarding this syslog message can be found in the Cisco ASA System Log Messages guide at: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/products_system_message_guides_list.html>. Logging is not enabled by default on Cisco ASA, however, when logging is enabled, Cisco ASA will automatically enable syslog message 305006.  Cisco ASA Software may be affected by this vulnerability if the following conditions are satisfied:    + System logging is enabled and syslogs are configured to be sent to *any* syslog destination (including Buffer or ASDM for example)   + Cisco ASA Software is configured in any way to generate syslog message 305006Syslog message 305006 has a default severity level of 3 (errors). Cisco ASA Software configured for logging at Level 3 or higher (that is Levels 3 through 7) may be vulnerable. To verify if logging is enabled, issue the **show logging** command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with logging enabled and buffer logging enabled at Level 6 (informational):     ```    ciscoasa# show loggingSyslog logging: enabled    Facility: 20    Timestamp logging: disabled    Standby logging: disabled    Debug-trace logging: disabled    Console logging: disabled    Monitor logging: disabled    Buffer logging: level informational, 2 messages logged    Trap logging: disabled    Permit-hostdown logging: disabled    History logging: disabled    Device ID: disabled    Mail logging: disabled    ASDM logging: disabled    ```        Using a custom message list (created via the **logging list** command) that includes syslog message 305006, either by severity or by explicitly including the message ID, is also a vulnerable configuration.       The default severity level of syslog messages can be changed. If the default severity level of syslog message 305006 is changed and the device is configured to log to any destination at the new severity level, the device is vulnerable.       **Note:** This vulnerability was introduced after the implementation of the new Cisco ASA Identity Firewall (IDFW) feature. The Cisco ASA IDFW feature was introduced in the Cisco ASA Software Version 8.4(2), thus previous versions of Cisco ASA Software are not affected.Protocol Independent Multicast Denial of Service VulnerabilityCisco ASA Sofware is affected by a vulnerability that may cause affected devices to reload during the processing of Protocol-Indipendent Multicast (PIM) message when multicast routing is enabled. This feature is not enabled by default. To verify if PIM is enabled on an interface use the **show pim interface** command and verify that the state *on* appears under the PIM column. The following example shows PIM enabled on the interface *outside* but disabled on the interface *inside*:      ```    ciscoasa# show pim interfaceAddress          Interface          PIM  Nbr   Hello  DR         DR                                         Count Intvl  Prior192.168.1.1      outside            on   0     30     1          this system192.168.2.1      inside             off  0     30     1          this system    ```   **Note:** Cisco ASA is vulnerable if at least one interface state is marked with *on* under the PIM column of the **show pim interface** command output.       Determine the Running Software VersionTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **show version** command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance that is running software version 8.4(1):     ```    ciscoasa#show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) Device Manager Version 6.4(1)    ```   Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.  Information about Cisco PIX Security Appliance Cisco PIX may be affected by some of the vulnerabilities described in this security advisory. Cisco PIX has reached end of maintenance support. Cisco PIX customers are encouraged to migrate to Cisco ASA.  All versions of the Cisco PIX Security Appliances Software are affected by the Protocol Independent Multicast Denial of Service Vulnerability.  Version 8.0 of Cisco PIX Security Appliances Software is affected by the Cisco ASA UDP Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability and Cisco ASA Threat Detection Denial of Service Vulnerability  Cisco PIX Security Appliances is not vulnerable to Cisco ASA Syslog Message 305006 Denial of Service Vulnerability. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableWith the exception of the Cisco FWSM, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The following section gives additional detail about each vulnerability.   Cisco ASA UDP Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability Inspection engines are required for services that   embed IP addressing information in the user data packet or that open   secondary channels on dynamically assigned ports. Cisco ASA Software supports a number   of inspection engines for UDP and TCP-based protocols.    The Cisco ASA UDP   inspection engine that is used to inspect UDP-based protocols contains a   vulnerability that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to trigger a   reload of the Cisco ASA. The vulnerability is due to improper flow   handling by the inspection engine. An attacker could exploit this   vulnerability by sending a specially crafted sequence through the   affected system.  All   UDP protocols that are inspected by the inspection engine may be   vulnerable to this vulnerability. The following protocols are known to use UDP inspection engine:    + Domain Name System (DNS)   + Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)   + Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)   + GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP)   + H.323, H.225 RAS   + Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP)   + SunRPC   + Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)   + X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)   + IBM NetBios   + Instant Messaging (depending on the particular IM client/solution being used) Inspection engines may be enabled by default on Cisco ASA Software. Please consult your user guide for more information. The   default inspected ports are listed at the following link: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa84/configuration/guide/inspect_overview.html#wp1536127> **Note:**   Only transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This   vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both   single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. Only UDP traffic can trigger this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtq10441](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq10441) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-0353.    Cisco ASA Threat Detection Denial of Service Vulnerability The Cisco ASA Threat Detection feature consists of different   levels of statistics gathered for various threats, as well as scanning   threat detection, which determines when a host is performing a scan. Optionally, you   can shun any hosts that are determined to be a scanning threat.  The Cisco ASA Threat Detection feature, when configured with the Cisco ASA Scanning Threat Mode feature and with the *shun* option enabled, contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to trigger a reload of the Cisco ASA. The vulnerability is due to   improper handling of the internal flaw that is triggered by the shun event. An   attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending IP packets through the affected system in a way that triggers the *shun* option of Threat Detection scanning feature. **Note:**   Only transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This   vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode only in   single context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and   IPv6 traffic.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtw35765](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtw35765) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-0354.    Cisco ASA Syslog Message 305006 Denial of Service Vulnerability Cisco ASA Software has a System Log (syslog)   feature that provides information for monitoring normal operation and   troubleshooting network or device issues. Syslog messages are   assigned different severities (including debugging, informational, error and critical, for example) and can be sent to different logging destinations.  A denial of service vulnerability is in the   implementation of one specific syslog message (message ID 305006), that can cause a reload of the   Cisco ASA if this syslog message needs to be   generated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending a sequence of packets that could trigger the generation of the syslog message.  Syslog message ID 305006 is generated when the Cisco ASA is unable to create a network address translation for a new   connection. Additional information about this syslog message can be found in the Cisco ASA System Log Messages guide: [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/products\_system\_message\_guides\_list.html](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/products_system_message_guides_list.html%20)  **Note:** Only transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This   vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both   single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by   IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.    This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCts39634](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts39634) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-0355.Protocol Independent Multicast Denial of Service Vulnerability Multicast routing is a bandwidth-conserving   technology that reduces traffic by simultaneously delivering a single   stream of information to multiple recipients.    Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) is a multicast   routing protocol that is independent of any IP routing   protocol. PIM can leverage any unicast routing   protocols that are in use, including   Exterior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), or static routes, to populate the unicast routing table. PIM uses this unicast routing   information to perform the multicast forwarding function, and is IP   protocol-independent. Although PIM is called a multicast routing   protocol, it actually uses the unicast routing table to perform the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check function instead of building a   completely independent multicast routing table. PIM does not send or   receive multicast routing updates between routers as do other routing   protocols.  A vulnerability exists in the way PIM is implemented that may cause affected devices to reload   during the processing of a PIM message when multicast routing is   enabled. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of PIM messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PIM message to the affected system.    **Note:** This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA configured only in routed firewall mode and only in single context mode.This vulnerability can be triggered only by IPv4 PIM message as PIM over IPv6 is currently not supported.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID, [CSCtr47517](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr47517) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-0356.  Workarounds  * The following section will detail the workaround if available for each vulnerability detailed in this security advisory.    Cisco ASA UDP Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. Cisco ASA Threat Detection Denial of Service Vulnerability If the *shun* option needs to be enabled, there are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. However, if this option is not required, you can workaround this vulnerability by disabling this option.  This can be done by issuing the **no threat-detection scanning-threat shun** command. The **threat-detection scanning-threat** command can be used afterwards to configure the feature without the *shun* option.  To verify that the *shun* option has been correctly removed, issue the **show running-config threat-detection scanning-threat** command and confirm that the returned output does not show the *shun* option. The following example shows a Cisco ASA configured with the *threat-detection scanning-threat* feature without the *shun* option enabled:  ```   ciscoasa# show running-config threat-detection scanning-threat   threat-detection scanning-threat       ``` Cisco ASA Syslog Message 305006 Denial of Service Vulnerability A possible workaround is to prevent the Cisco ASA from generating the particular syslog message. This can be done by issuing the **no logging message 305006** command.  To verify that the message is not being generated issue **show running-configuration logging** command. The following example shows the output of the command when the logging of message 305006 is disabled:  ```   ciscoasa# show run logging[...]no logging message 305006[...]   ```   Protocol Independent Multicast Denial of Service Vulnerability If PIM is required to be enabled, then there are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. However, if multicast routing is required but PIM is not used, PIM can be disabled on the Cisco ASA interfaces by issuing the **no pim** interface-level command. The following example shows the interface Ethernet0/0 on a Cisco ASA device with PIM disabled:  ```   interface Ethernet0/0 nameif outside security-level 0 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 no pim      ```  To verify that PIM is disabled on all interfaces, issue the **show pim interface** command and make sure that for all interface the PIM state is set to *off*. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with PIM disabled on all interfaces.  ```   ciscoasa# show pim interfaceAddress          Interface          PIM  Nbr   Hello  DR         DR                                         Count Intvl  Prior192.168.1.1      outside            off  0     30     1          this system192.168.2.1      inside             off  0     30     1          this system      ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
