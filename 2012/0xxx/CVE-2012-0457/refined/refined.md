  "CVE-2012-0457": {
    "description": "Security researcher Atte Kettunen from OUSPG found two issues with Firefox's handling of SVG using the Address Sanitizer tool. The first issue, critically rated, is a use-after-free in SVG animation that could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. The second issue is rated moderate and is an out of bounds read in SVG Filters. This could potentially incorporate data from the user's memory, making it accessible to the page content.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability in SVG animation handling and an out of bounds read vulnerability in SVG filter handling.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free",
        "Out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution (use-after-free), information leak (out-of-bounds read).",
      "attack_vectors": "By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted web page or mail message with malicious SVG content.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious SVG file, and tricking a user into rendering this malicious content via web browser or browser-like contexts such as Thunderbird. The attacker does not require specific privileges or any form of authentication for exploitation."
