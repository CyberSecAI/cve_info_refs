# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-035 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2693777)

Published: May 08, 2012 | Updated: October 03, 2012

**Version:** 2.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in the .NET Framework. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution on a client system if a user views a specially crafted webpage using a web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs). Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of the Microsoft .NET Framework on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the manner in which the .NET Framework serialization process handles trusted and untrusted data. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

[1]**.NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile affected.** The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of .NET Framework 4. The vulnerability addressed in this update affects both .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Installing the .NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5a4x27ek.aspx).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on** **May** **22, 2012?**

Added an entry to the update FAQ to announce a detection change for KB2604092 for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 and KB2604110 for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 to correct an installation issue. This is a detection change only. There were no changes to the security update files. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to take any action.

**Why was this bulletin revised on May 10, 2012?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to communicate that for all supported systems running Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1, except when installed on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are addressed by security update KB2656353. Security update KB2656353 was previously offered in [MS11-100](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=232432), but also addresses the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin, CVE-2012-0160 and CVE-2012-0161.

Security update KB2656353 is available through all standard deployment channels, including [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747), [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130), and the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129). There were no changes to the security update files. Customers who have successfully installed either KB2656353, from MS11-100, or KB2604044, previously offered through this bulletin, do not need to take any action. Customers running Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 on all supported systems except Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2, who have not installed either KB2656353 or KB2604044, should apply the KB2656353 update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

**Is this bulletin related to MS12-034,** **Combined Security Update for Microsoft Office, Windows, .NET Framework,** **and Silverlight?**

No. Although both of these security updates affect the .NET Framework, the updates affect different components and are not related. These updates may be applied in any order.

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912.aspx).

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

## .NET Framework Serialization Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0160

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft .NET Framework due to the improper serialization of untrusted input. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-0160](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-0160).

#### Mitigating Factors for .NET Framework Serialization Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0160

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability only on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and only in a web browsing attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about [Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx).
* Standard .NET Framework applications are not affected by this vulnerability. Only specially crafted .NET Framework applications could exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for .NET Framework Serialization Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0160

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable partially trusted Microsoft .NET applications**

  To disable all Microsoft .NET applications running at partial trust, including XAML browser applications (XBAPs) and Microsoft .NET applications located on the network, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  `caspol -pp offcaspol -m -resetlockdowncaspol -pp on`

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to complete this workaround.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET applications may not run.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To reset the Microsoft .NET security policies to the defaults, run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  `caspol -pp offcaspol -m -resetcaspol -pp on`

  **Note** You must be logged in as administrator or have administrative credentials to undo this workaround.
* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  3. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XAML browser applications**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XPS documents**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. On the **Security** tab, click **Custom level**. Under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, set **Run components not signed with Authenticode** to either **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to disable XAML browser applications or require a prompt before it runs Loose XAML, XAML browser applications, or XPS documents in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu, and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Reset all zones to default level**, and then click **OK**.

#### FAQ for .NET Framework Serialization Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0160

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the serialization process within the .NET Framework incorrectly treats untrusted data as trusted.

**What is** **Serialization in the .NET Framework?**

Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported. The complement of serialization is deserialization, which converts a stream into an object. The most basic serializer in the .NET Framework in the binary serializer. For more information about this component, see the MSDN article [Binary Serialization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/72hyey7b%28v%3Dvs.100%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are two attack scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability: a web browsing scenario and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions. These scenarios are described as follows:

* **Web browsing attack scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.
* **Windows .NET applications attack scenario**

  This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a web application and a rich-client application. Like web applications, XBAPs can be published to a web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What are .NET Framework Code Access Security (CAS) Restrictions?**

The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security. Code access security (CAS) enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity. Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run. Using code access security can reduce the likelihood that your code will be misused by malicious or error-filled code. For more information on CAS, see the MSDN article, [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described as follows: systems that are using the web browsing scenario and systems that are using the Windows .NET applications scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Windows .NET applications**

  Workstations and servers that run untrusted Windows .NET applications are also at risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the .NET Framework serialization process handles trusted and untrusted data.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### FAQ for .NET Framework Serialization Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0161

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework improperly handles an exception during the object serialization process.

**What is** **Object Serialization in the .NET Framework?**

Serialization can be defined as the process of storing the state of an object instance to a storage medium. During this process, the public and private fields of the object and the name of the class, including the assembly containing the class, is converted to a stream of bytes, which is then written to a data stream. When the object is subsequently deserialized, an exact clone of the original object is created. For more information, see the MSDN article [Object Serialization in the .NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms973893.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In the web browsing scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Removing the Update**

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-100 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2638420)

Published: December 29, 2011 | Updated: July 10, 2012

**Version:** 1.6

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an unauthenticated attacker sends a specially crafted web request to the target site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action in the context of an existing account on the ASP.NET site, including executing arbitrary commands. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to register an account on the ASP.NET site, and must know an existing user name.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4 on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the .NET Framework handles specially crafted requests, and how the ASP.NET Framework authenticates users and handles cached content. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2659883](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2659883).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2638420](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2638420) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

| Affected Software | Microsoft Knowledge Base Article |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows Developer Preview | [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2656360](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2656360) |
| Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 on Windows Developer Preview | [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2656354](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2656354) |

Security updates are available from [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) and [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin, this update includes functional changes to the ASP.NET framework. The update limits the maximum number of form keys, files, and JSON members to 1000 in a request. This change results in ASP.NET applications rejecting requests having greater than 1000 of such elements. Clients making requests of these types will be denied and will see an error message in their browsers (typically an error 500). This limit can be configured per application. Please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2661403](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2661403).

The update also changes the format of forms authentication tickets in a way that could be incompatible with the older version of forms authentication tickets. For example, after installing this update, in web farm environments where some servers are updated while others are not, there may be the case where the updated servers could generate forms authentication tickets that are incompatible on non-updated servers. Please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2661404](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2661404).

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912.aspx).

**There are two updates listed for the version of the Microsoft .NET Framework installed on my system. Do I need to install both updates?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for one version of the .NET Framework can be applied in any sequence. We recommend that multiple updates for different versions of the .NET Framework be applied in sequence from lowest version number to highest, however that sequence is not required.

**I have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed; this version is not listed among the affected software in this bulletin. Do I need to install an update?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer and the .NET Framework 4. The .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installer chains in the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup, so installing the former also installs the latter. Therefore, customers who have the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed need to install security updates for the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed. Do I need to install any additional updates?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer and the .NET Framework 4. The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installer chains in both the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup and the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 setup. Therefore, customers who have the .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed also need to install security updates for the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product life cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that ASP.NET Framework handles specially crafted requests, causing a hash collision. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could send a small number of specially crafted requests to an ASP.NET server, causing performance to degrade significantly enough to cause a denial of service condition.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3414](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3414).

#### Mitigating Factors for Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, IIS is not enabled on any Windows operating system
* Sites that disallow application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data HTTP content types are not vulnerable
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET Framework is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Configuration-based workaround**

  The following workaround configures the limit of the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client. Decreasing the maximum request size will decrease the susceptibility of the ASP.NET server to a denial of service attack.

  **Note:** Please back up your configuration before you make any changes to it.

  This configuration value can be applied globally to all ASP.NET sites on a server by adding the entry to root web.config or applicationhost.config. Alternatively, this configuration can be restricted to a particular site or application by adding it to a web.config file for the particular site or application. For more information on ASP.NET configuration, please reference the MSDN article [ASP.NET Configuration Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms178683.aspx).

  1. If your application uses ViewState, add the following configuration in the appropriate ASP.NET configuration file to limit the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client to 200 KB.

     ```
     <configuration>

     ```

<system.web>
<httpruntime maxrequestlength="200â />
</system.web>
</configuration>
```

```
2.  If your application does not use ASP.NET ViewState, add the following configuration in the appropriate ASP.NET configuration file to limit the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client to 20 KB.

    ```
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;httpRuntime maxRequestLength=">

```

</system.web>
```

```
2.  If your application does not use ASP.NET ViewState, add the following configuration in the appropriate ASP.NET configuration file to limit the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client to 20 KB.

    ```
    <configuration>

```

<system.web>
<httpruntime maxrequestlength="20â />
</system.web>
</configuration>
```

```
For more information on the maxRequestLength configuration option, please refer to MSDN documentation on the [httpRuntime Element](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e1f13641.aspx).

**Note:** Increasing the default HTTP querystring and request header size limits will increase the susceptibility of the server to the denial of service issue being described in this advisory. For more information about how to set these limits, see [Http.sys registry settings for IIS](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/820129).

**Impact of workaround:** Client requests that exceed the configured maxRequestLength will result in a ConfigurationErrorsException thrown on the server-side and an http error status returned to the client. The limits configured previously should be used as a baseline and can be adjusted to avoid application failures. Configuring the maxRequestLength value with a smaller value also reduces the serverâs susceptibility to this particular denial of service. Applications that accept client file uploads and those that generate a large viewstate are examples of applications that may be impacted by this workaround.

After you apply this workaround, the following client request failure may appear in Application event log.

```
    Event code: 3004
    Event message: Post size exceeded allowed limits.
     Exception information:
          Exception type: HttpException
          Exception message: Maximum request length exceeded.
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.GetEntireRawContent()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.FillInFormCollection()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.get_Form()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.get_HasForm()
    at System.Web.UI.Page.GetCollectionBasedOnMethod(Boolean dontReturnNull)
    at System.Web.UI.Page.DeterminePostBackMode()
    at System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMain(Boolean includeStagesBeforeAsyncPoint, Boolean includeStagesAfterAsyncPoint)
```

Alternatively, the request failure may result in the following entry in an IIS log file.

```
    #Fields: s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
```

```
    127.0.0.1 POST /webSite/Default.aspx - 80 - 127.0.0.1 - 500 0 0 1268
```

**Removing workaround:** To undo the workaround, remove the configuration sections that were added in this workaround or revert to a backup of the configuration before the workarounds.

```

## Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way that .NET Framework verifies return URLs during the forms authentication process. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing without the user's knowledge. The attacker could then perform a phishing attack to gain information from the user they did not intend to disclose. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to further compromise user information intended to remain private.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3415](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3415).

#### Mitigating Factors for Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise user information.
* By default, installing ASP.NET does not enable Forms Authentication. It has to be explicitly configured per-application to be enabled.
* By default, IIS is not installed.
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET Framework is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
* The attacker would have to convince the user to click a link in order to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable Forms Authentication in web.config**
  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set the authentication mode to either Windows, Passport or None.

     ```
     &lt;system.web&gt;

         &lt;authentication mode=">

     ```

</system.web>
```

```
For more information on the maxRequestLength configuration option, please refer to MSDN documentation on the [httpRuntime Element](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e1f13641.aspx).

**Note:** Increasing the default HTTP querystring and request header size limits will increase the susceptibility of the server to the denial of service issue being described in this advisory. For more information about how to set these limits, see [Http.sys registry settings for IIS](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/820129).

**Impact of workaround:** Client requests that exceed the configured maxRequestLength will result in a ConfigurationErrorsException thrown on the server-side and an http error status returned to the client. The limits configured previously should be used as a baseline and can be adjusted to avoid application failures. Configuring the maxRequestLength value with a smaller value also reduces the serverâs susceptibility to this particular denial of service. Applications that accept client file uploads and those that generate a large viewstate are examples of applications that may be impacted by this workaround.

After you apply this workaround, the following client request failure may appear in Application event log.

```
    Event code: 3004
    Event message: Post size exceeded allowed limits.
     Exception information:
          Exception type: HttpException
          Exception message: Maximum request length exceeded.
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.GetEntireRawContent()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.FillInFormCollection()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.get_Form()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.get_HasForm()
    at System.Web.UI.Page.GetCollectionBasedOnMethod(Boolean dontReturnNull)
    at System.Web.UI.Page.DeterminePostBackMode()
    at System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMain(Boolean includeStagesBeforeAsyncPoint, Boolean includeStagesAfterAsyncPoint)
```

Alternatively, the request failure may result in the following entry in an IIS log file.

```
    #Fields: s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
```

```
    127.0.0.1 POST /webSite/Default.aspx - 80 - 127.0.0.1 - 500 0 0 1268
```

**Removing workaround:** To undo the workaround, remove the configuration sections that were added in this workaround or revert to a backup of the configuration before the workarounds.

```

#### FAQ for Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a spoofing vulnerability. This vulnerability could enable an attacker to redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing without the user's knowledge. The attacker could then perform a phishing attack to gain information from the user they did not intend to disclose. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to further compromise user information intended to remain private.

**What is phishing?**

Online phishing (pronounced like fishing) is a way to trick computer users into revealing personal or financial information through a fraudulent email message or website. A common online phishing scam starts with an email message that resembles an official notice from a trusted source, such as a bank, credit card company, or reputable online merchant. In the email message, recipients are directed to a fraudulent website where they are asked to provide personal information, such as an account number or password. This information is then usually used for identity theft.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework incorrectly verifies return URLs during the forms authentication process.

**What is Forms Authentication in ASP.NET?**

Forms authentication uses an authentication ticket that is created when a user logs on to a site, and then it tracks the user throughout the site. The forms authentication ticket is usually contained inside a cookie. However, ASP.NET version 2.0 supports cookieless forms authentication, which results in the ticket being passed in a query string. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Explained: Forms Authentication in ASP.NET 2.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff647070.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing without the user's knowledge. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to further compromise user information intended to remain private.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could create a specially crafted URL and convince a user to click it. After a user logs in to an expected website, the attacker then redirects the user to a website controlled by the attacker. Then, the attacker could convince the user to divulge information otherwise intended to remain private. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website after logging in to an expected website.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Internet-facing systems with ASP.NET installed are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. In addition, internal websites that use ASP.NET forms authentication can be at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Framework verifies return URLs during forms authentication.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that .NET Framework authenticates users. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would need to be able to register an account on the ASP.NET application, and must know an existing account name for a targeted user. The attacker could then craft a special web request using a previously registered account name to gain access to that account. The attacker could then take any action in the context of the targeted user, including executing arbitrary commands on the site.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3416](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3416).

#### Mitigating Factors for ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

#### Workarounds for ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set ticketCompatibilityMode to Framework40**

  This only applies to sites that are running ASP.NET 4 and newer because the ticketCompatibilityMode setting was introduced in ASP.NET v4.0.

  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set the ticketCompatibilityMode to Framework40. Note that the default value for this setting is "Framework20"

     ```
     <system.web>

     ```

```
```
**How to undo the workaround.**

Restore your web.config file from your backup copy.

```

* **Disable Forms Authentication in web.config**
  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set the authentication mode to either Windows, Passport or None.

     ```

#### FAQ for ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability where a remote unauthenticated attacker can gain access to another account on the ASP.NET application, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the site in the context of the targeted user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the ASP.NET Framework incorrectly authenticates specially crafted usernames.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action in the context of the targeted user, including executing arbitrary commands on the site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would first need to have knowledge of an existing account name to impersonate on the site. The attacker could then craft a special web request using a previously registered account name to gain access to that account. The attacker could then take any action in the context of the targeted user, including executing arbitrary commands on the site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Internet-facing systems with ASP.NET installed are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. In addition, internal websites that use ASP.NET forms authentication can be at risk from this vulnerability.

**If my website uses a web farm, will I need to update all the** **computers** **in the web farm?**

Yes. This update changes the format of the forms authentication ticket in a way that is incompatible with the earlier format. This means that tickets generated by using the new behavior cannot be read by computers using the old behavior, and vice versa. Administrators whose applications use forms-based authentication must take specific steps when deploying this security update to ensure that all of their servers switch to the new behavior simultaneously.

For more information, see the [Microsoft TechNet Article 2659968](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2659968).

**Is it possible to update the** **computers** **in my web farm one at a time** **instead ofall at the same time?**

Yes. If it is not feasible to deploy MS11-100 to all the servers in a given web farm simultaneously, you can set a compatibility switch in your web.config or machine.config file before installing the update to force the old behavior after the update is installed. The compatibility switch to use is as follows:

```
<appsettings>
<add key="aspnet:UseLegacyFormsAuthenticationTicketCompatibility" value="true">
</add></appsettings>

```

Setting this switch will allow web farms with only some machines updated to continue functioning correctly. However, it is important to know that computers with the configuration switch set will be in an insecure state, and will not benefit from the fix in this security update. After MS11-100 has been deployed to all the computers in a farm, the configuration switch must be removed to enable the new, secure behavior.

**Will this update honor my siteâs forms authentication ticketCompatibilityMode setting?**

No. Since the fix in this security update changes the format of forms authentication tickets, the ticketCompatibilityMode configuration setting is no longer supported once MS11-100 is installed.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Framework authenticates users.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## ASP.NET Forms Authentication Ticket Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3417

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that ASP.NET Framework handles cached content when Forms Authentication is used with sliding expiry. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action including executing arbitrary commands that the user could take on the site in the context of the target user. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted link to the user and convincing the user to click the link. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3417](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3417).

#### Mitigating Factors for ASP.NET Forms Authentication Ticket Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3417

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, ASP.NET responses are not cached by the OutputCache. The developer of the site has to opt in to output caching through the OutputCache directive on a page.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the target user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, IIS is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually install this are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for ASP.NET Forms Authentication Ticket Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3417

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict forms authentication cookies to SSL channels**

  Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy.

  Set requireSSL="true" on the <forms> element, as shown in the following code.

  ```
      <forms loginurl="Secure\Login.aspx" requiressl="true">

  ```

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Restore your web.config file from your backup copy.
* **Disable sliding expiration for forms authentication cookies**

  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set slidingExpiration="false" on the <forms> element, as shown in the following code.

     ```
     </forms><forms slidingexpiration="false">

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Users would be forced to re-login after their tickets expire.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Restore your web.config file from your backup copy.
* **Disable OutputCache**

  1. Back up your web application folder.
  2. Remove all <%@ OutputCache %> directives in your web pages.
  3. If your website is an MVC application, also remove all OutputCache attributes from your controller actions.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users would be forced to re-login after their tickets expire.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **Setup Modes** |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| **Install Options** |  |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/nobackup** | Do not back up files for uninstall. |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrite OEM files without prompting. |
| \*\*/integrate:\*\**path* | Integrates the software updates into the Windows installation source files located at the path specified. Note that *:path* refers to the folder that contains the i386 folder. |
| **/ER** | Enable extended error reporting. |
| \*\*/d:\*\**path* | Specifies a backup directory for Windows Service Pack installation. *:path* indicates the destination folder for the backup files. The default backup location is *%Systemdrive%*\$ntservicepackuninstall$. |
| **/extract[:***path***]** | Extracts files without starting Setup. If "*:path*" is not included, you are prompted for the path of a destination folder to extract the files. If "*:path*" is used, the files are extracted to the specified destination folder. |
| **/hotpatch:disable** | Disables hotpatching functionality, and installs the cold patch only. |
| **Restart Options** |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| **Logging Options** |  |
| \*\*/log:\*\**path* | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates *%Windir%*\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)

**Reference Table**

The following table contains the security update information for this software. You can find additional information in the subsection, **Deployment Information**, in this section.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

**Verifying That** **the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

# Internet Explorer: Enhanced Security Configuration

* Article
* 08/31/2016
## In this article

Updated: April 14, 2016

## Overview

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration places your server and Internet Explorer in a configuration that decreases the exposure of your server to potential attacks that can occur through Web content and application scripts. As a result, some Web sites may not display or perform as expected.

This topic contains the following information:

* Internet Explorer security zones
* How to browse when Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled
* Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

  + Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration and Terminal Services
  + Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on the Internet Explorer user experience
* Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

  + Add sites to the Trusted sites zone
  + Add sites to the Local intranet zone
  + Apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users
  + Apply Internet Explorer security settings manually on your server
  + Upgrading from previous versions of Internet Explorer
* Browser security best practices

## Internet Explorer security zones

In Internet Explorer, you can configure security settings for two of the built-in security zones: the **Local intranet** zone and the **Trusted sites** zone. You cannot change the security settings for the **Internet** zone and the **Restricted sites** zone.

Note

To change security settings, you must open Internet Explorer in administrator mode, even if you are logged in as a local administrator. To open Internet Explorer in administrator mode, right-click **Internet Explorer**, and then click **Run as administrator**.

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration assigns security levels to these zones as follows:

* For the **Internet** zone, the security level is set to **High**.
* For the **Trusted sites** zone, the security level is set to **Medium**, which allows browsing of many Internet sites.
* For the **Local intranet** zone, the security level is set to **Medium-low**, which allows your user credentials (user name and password) to be sent automatically to sites and applications that need them.
* For the **Restricted sites** zone, the security level is set to **High**.
* All Internet and intranet sites are assigned to the **Internet** zone by default. Intranet sites are not part of the **Local intranet** zone unless you explicitly add them to this zone.

## How to browse when Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled

Enhanced Security Configuration increases the level of security on your server, but it may also affect Internet browsing in the following ways:

* Because ActiveX controls and scripting are disabled, Internet sites may not display in Internet Explorer as expected and applications that use the Internet may not work correctly. If you trust an Internet site and need it to be functional, you can add that site to the **Trusted sites** zone in Internet Explorer. If you attempt to browse an Internet site that uses scripting or ActiveX controls, Internet Explorer will prompt you to consider adding the site to the **Trusted sites** zone. You should add the site to the **Trusted sites** zone only if you are completely confident that the site is trustworthy and that the URL to be added is indeed the correct one. For more information, see Add sites to the Trusted sites zone.
* Access to intranet sites, Web-based applications that run over a local intranet, and other files on network shares may be restricted. If you trust an intranet site or share and need it to be functional, you can add it to the **Local intranet** zone. For more information, see Add sites to the Local intranet zone.

## Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration adjusts the security levels for the existing security zones. The following table describes how each zone is affected.

| Zone | Security level | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internet | High | This zone has the same security settings as the **Restricted sites** zone. All Internet and intranet sites are assigned to this zone by default. Web pages may not display in Internet Explorer as expected and applications that require the browser may not work correctly because scripts, ActiveX controls, and file downloads have been disabled. If you trust an Internet site and need it to be functional, you can add that site to the **Trusted sites** zone in Internet Explorer. For more information, see Add sites to the Trusted sites zone. Access to scripts, executable files, and other files on Universal Naming Convention (UNC) shares is restricted unless the share is added to the **Local intranet** zone explicitly. For more information, see Add sites to the Local intranet zone. |
| Local intranet | Medium-low | When visiting intranet sites, you may be repeatedly prompted for credentials (your user name and password) as a result of Enhanced Security Configuration. Enhanced Security Configuration disables the automatic detection of intranet sites. If you want your credentials to be sent automatically to certain intranet sites, add those sites to the **Local intranet** zone. For more information, see Add sites to the Local intranet zone. Do not add Internet sites to the **Local intranet** zone because your credentials will be sent automatically to the site if they are requested. |
| Trusted sites | Medium | This zone is for the Internet sites whose content you trust. For more information, see Add sites to the Trusted sites zone. |
| Restricted sites | High | This zone contains sites you do not trust, such as sites that may damage your computer or data if you attempt to download or run files from them. |

Enhanced Security Configuration also adjusts the Internet Explorer extensibility and security settings to further reduce exposure to possible future security threats. These settings can be found on the **Advanced** tab of the **Internet Options** dialog box in Internet Explorer. The following table describes the settings that are affected.

| Name | Default setting | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enable third-party browser extensions | Off | Disables features you installed for use with Internet Explorer that may have been created by companies other than Microsoft. |
| Play sounds in Web pages | Off | Disables music and other sounds. |
| Play animations in Web pages | Off | Disables animations. |
| Check for server certificate revocation | On | Automatically checks a Web site's certificate to see whether it has been revoked before accepting it as valid. |
| Do not save encrypted pages to disk | On | Disables saving secured information in your Temporary Internet Files folder. |
| Empty Temporary Internet Files folder when browser is closed | On | Automatically clears the Temporary Internet Files folder when you close the browser. |
| Warn if changing between secure and not secure mode | On | Displays a warning that the browser is redirecting from a secure Web site to a non-secure Web site. |
| Enable memory protection to help mitigate online attacks | Off | Enables Data Execution Prevention (DEP) to help mitigate online attacks. This option applies to Windows Server 2008 only. |

These changes reduce the functionality in Web pages, Web-based applications, local network resources, and applications that use a browser to display Help, support, and general user assistance.

For more information about using the **Local intranet** or **Trusted sites** zones' inclusion lists, see Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

When Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled:

* The Microsoft Update Web site is added to the **Trusted sites** zone. This allows you to continue to get important updates for your operating system.
* The Windows error reporting site is added to the **Trusted sites** zone. This allows you to report problems encountered with your operating system and search for fixes.
* Several local computer sites (such as https://localhost, https://localhost, and hcp://system) are added to the **Local intranet** zone. This allows applications and code to work locally so that you can complete common administrative tasks.
* The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) level is set to **Medium** for the **Trusted sites** zone. If you want to change the P3P level for any zone other than the **Internet** zone, go to the **Privacy** tab of the **Internet Options** dialog box, and click **Import** to apply a custom privacy policy. For sample privacy policies, see How to Create a Customized Privacy Import File ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=12939](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=12939)).

## Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration and Terminal Services

Enhanced Security Configuration applies to different user accounts according to the type of installation. The following table describes how the users are affected.

| Type of installation | Enhanced Security Configuration is applied to Administrators | Enhanced Security Configuration is applied to Power Users | Enhanced Security Configuration is applied to Limited Users | Enhanced Security Configuration is applied to Restricted Users |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Upgrade of the operating system | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Unattended installation of the operating system | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Manual installation of Terminal Services | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

Note

During the manual Terminal Services installation, you are prompted to disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration for users. This allows users to run a terminal server session without restrictions.

System administrators should carefully consider the risks of using of internet-connected applications in a multiuser server before proceeding to disable Enhanced Security Configuration. While disabling Enhanced Security Configuration will improve web browsing experience for users, it will increase the risk of users becoming the victims of web-hosted attacks that can then lead to a system-wide security compromise.

For more information about applying Enhanced Security Configuration, see Apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users.

## Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on the Internet Explorer user experience

The following table describes how Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration affects each user's experience with Internet Explorer.

| Task | Can be completed by Administrators | Can be completed by Power Users | Can be completed by Limited Users | Can be completed by Restricted Users |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Turn on or off Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration | Yes | No | No | No |
| Adjust the security level for a particular zone in Internet Explorer | Yes     | Note | | --- | | You can change security settings only for the **Local intranet** zone and the **Trusted sites** zone. | | Yes, on computers running Windows Server?2003 No, on computers running Windows Server 2008 | No | No |
| Add sites to the **Trusted sites** zone | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Add sites to the **Local intranet** zone | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

All other Internet Explorer tasks can be completed by all user groups unless you choose to restrict user access further.

Overview

## Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is designed to reduce your server's exposure to security threats. To ensure that you get the most benefit from Enhanced Security Configuration, consider these browser management recommendations:

* All Internet and intranet sites are assigned to the **Internet** zone by default. If you trust an Internet or intranet site and need it to be functional, add the Internet site to the **Trusted sites** zone, and add the intranet site to the **Local intranet** zone. For more information about the security levels for each zone, see Effects of Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* If you want to run a browser-based client application over the Internet, you should add the Web page that hosts the application to the **Trusted sites** zone. For more information, see Add sites to the Trusted sites zone.
* If you want to run a browser-based client application over a protected and secure local intranet, you should add the Web page that hosts the application to the **Local intranet** zone. For more information, see Add sites to the Local intranet zone.
* Add internal sites and local servers to the **Local intranet** zone to make sure you have access to, and can run, applications from your servers.
* Use unattend.txt to add intranet sites and UNC servers to the **Local intranet** zone inclusion list as part of the installation process. For more information, see the Readme file in Deploy.cab on the Windows Server?2003 product CD.
* Use client computers to download drivers, service packs, and other updates. Avoid any browsing from servers.
* If you use disk imaging to install operating systems on your servers, add the intranet sites and UNC servers you trust to the **Local intranet** zone, and add the Internet sites that you trust to the **Trusted sites** zone on the base image. You can then change the list on images for different server types and needs.

## Add sites to the Trusted sites zone

When Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled on your server, the security settings for all Internet sites are set to **High**. If you trust a Web page and need it to be functional, you can add that page to the **Trusted sites** zone in Internet Explorer.

1. Navigate to the site that you want to add.
2. On the status bar, double-click the security zone name (such as **Internet**) to open the **Internet Security** dialog box.
3. Click **Trusted sites**, and then click **Sites**.
4. In the **Trusted sites** dialog box, click **Add** to add the site to the list, and then click **Close**.
5. Refresh the page to view the site from its new zone.
6. Check the status bar of the browser to confirm that the site is in the **Trusted sites** zone.

**Notes**

* If an Internet site tries to use scripting or ActiveX controls, a dialog box will prompt you to add the Internet site to the **Trusted sites** zone. If you have disabled this dialog box, you can re-enable it in Internet Explorer. On the **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**. On the **Advanced** tab, select **Display enhanced security configuration dialog**.
* A Web page can be part of only one zone at a time. You cannot add a page to both the **Trusted sites** zone and the **Local intranet** zone.
* When you add a Web page to the **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding the domain for that page. Therefore, all pages within that domain are also added. For example, if you add *<https://www.microsoft.com/windows/>* to your **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding *<https://www.microsoft.com>*. If you then want to view the Help and Support site, you will have to add *<https://support.microsoft.com>* separately, because the Help and Support site is a separate domain.
* Internet Explorer maintains two different lists of sites for the **Trusted sites** zone. One list is in effect when Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled, and a separate list is in effect when Enhanced Security Configuration is disabled. When you add a Web page to the **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding it only to the list that is currently in effect.
* You can use wildcard characters to add all subdomains for a given domain. For example, you can add *\*.microsoft.com* to the list, which adds both *[www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com)* and *support.microsoft.com*.
* Many Internet sites use more than one domain to host their content. You may have to add several domains to the **Trusted sites** zone to have full functionality for one site.
* During installation, you can add many sites at one time to the **Trusted sites** zone by using certain settings in unattend.txt. For more information, see the Readme file in Deploy.cab on the Windows Server?2003 product CD. You can also use Group Policy to add and manage multiple sites. For more information, see the Microsoft Windows Server?2003 Deployment Kit ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=4298](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=4298)).

## Add sites to the Local intranet zone

When Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled, the security settings for all intranet sites are set to **High**. As a result, you are prompted for your credentials (your user name and password) each time you visit intranet sites that have not been added to the **Local intranet** zone. If you routinely use intranet sites and you know those sites are trustworthy, you can add them to the **Local intranet** zone in Internet Explorer.

1. Navigate to the local intranet site that you want to add.
2. On the status bar, double-click the security zone name (such as **Internet**) to open the **Internet Security** dialog box.
3. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Sites**.
4. In the **Local intranet** dialog box, click **Add** to add the site to the list, and then click **Close**.
5. Refresh the page to view the site from its new zone.
6. Check the status bar of the browser to confirm that the site is in the **Local intranet** zone.

**Notes**

* Do not add Internet sites to the **Local intranet** zone because your credentials are sent automatically to the site if they are requested.
* A Web page can be part of only one zone at a time. You cannot add a page to both the **Trusted sites** zone and the **Local intranet** zone.
* Enhanced Security Configuration also restricts access to scripts, executable files, and other potentially unsafe files on a UNC path unless it is added to the **Local intranet** zone explicitly. For example, if you want to access *\\server\share\setup.exe*, you must add *\\server* to the **Local intranet** zone.
* When you add a Web page to the **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding the domain for that page. Therefore, all pages within that domain are also added. For example, if you add *<https://www.microsoft.com/windows/>* to your **Trusted sites** zone, you are adding *<https://www.microsoft.com>*. If you then want to view the Help and Support site, you will have to add *<https://support.microsoft.com>* separately, because the Help and Support site is a separate domain.
* Internet Explorer maintains two different lists of sites for the **Local intranet** zone. One list is in effect when Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled, and a separate list is in effect when Enhanced Security Configuration is disabled. When you add a Web site to the **Local intranet** zone, you are adding it only to the list that is currently in effect.
* During installation you can add many sites at one time to the **Local intranet** zone by using certain settings in unattend.txt. For more information, see the Readme file in Deploy.cab on the Windows Server?2003 product CD. You can also use Group Policy to add and manage multiple sites. For more information, see the Microsoft Windows Server?2003 Deployment Kit. ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=4298](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=4298)).

## Apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration allows you to control the level of Internet Explorer access allowed to certain user groups on your server. The steps for applying Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users are different for Windows Server?2003 and Windows Server 2008.

### To apply Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users by using a computer running Windows Server?2003

1. Log on to the computer with a user account that is a member of the local Administrators group.
2. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
3. Click **Add or Remove Programs**, and then click **Add/Remove Windows Components**.
4. Select the **Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration** check box, and then click **Details**.
5. Select the user group or groups that you want to apply Enhanced Security Configuration to (**Administrators group** or **All other user groups**), and then click **OK**.
6. Click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.
7. Restart Internet Explorer to apply Enhanced Security Configuration.

### To apply Enhanced Security Configuration to specific users by using a computer running Windows Server?2008

1. Log on to the computer with a user account that is a member of the local Administrators group.
2. Click **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Server Manager**.
3. If the **User Account Control** dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click **Continue**.
4. Under **Security Information**, click **Configure IE?ESC**.

Note

Server Manager opens with the same window that was in use when it was last closed. If you do not see the **Security Information** section, click **Server Manager** in the console tree.

5. Under **Administrators**, click **On (Recommended)** or **Off**, depending on your desired configuration.
6. Under **Users**, click **On (Recommended)** or **Off**, depending on your desired configuration.
7. Click **OK**.
8. Restart Internet Explorer to apply Enhanced Security Configuration.

**Notes**

* When you apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to the Administrators group, the settings are applied to administrators. For Windows Server?2003, when you apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to **All other user groups**, the settings are applied to all groups except for the Administrators group. For Windows Server 2008, when you apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to **Users**, the settings are applied to all groups except for the Administrators group.
* For more information about Internet Explorer security zones, see About URL Security Zone Templates ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=12658](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=12658)).
* When you apply Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration to any user group while Internet Explorer is open, you must exit Internet Explorer and restart it for the changes to take effect.

## Apply Internet Explorer security settings manually on your server

If you do not use Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration in your environment, you can use the **Internet Options** dialog box in Internet Explorer to manually apply the security settings on your server.

### To manually apply Internet Explorer security settings

1. Open Internet Explorer.
2. Click **Tools**, and then click **Internet Options**.
3. On the **Security** tab, select the zone that you want to adjust: **Local intranet** or **Trusted sites**.

Note

You cannot change the security level of the **Internet** zone and the **Restricted sites** zone.

4. Under **Security level for this zone**, click **Default level** to use the default security level for the zone, or click **Custom level** and then select the settings you want.
5. Click **OK** to close the **Internet Options** dialog box.

**Notes**

* For **Restricted sites**, click **Custom level**, and then click a level in the **Reset to** list.
* For more information about Internet Explorer security zones, see About URL Security Zone Templates ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=12658](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=12658)).

## Upgrading from previous versions of Internet Explorer

When upgrading to a later version of Internet Explorer, the settings from the previous version are retained. If Internet Explorer is using Enhanced Security Configuration and is upgraded to a later version, it will continue to use Enhanced Security Configuration. If Internet Explorer is not using Enhanced Security Configuration and is upgraded to a later version, it will not have this feature turned on during the upgrade.

**Notes**

* Browser customizations are always retained during an Internet Explorer upgrade. If Internet Explorer was using Enhanced Security Configuration and you made a configuration change, the Internet Explorer upgrade would retain that change.
* If you remove a version of Internet Explorer that is using Enhanced Security Configuration, the previous version will continue to use Enhanced Security Configuration. This is true when removing a version of Internet Explorer that is not using Enhanced Security Configuration. As with the Internet Explorer upgrade, any customizations to it will be retained in the uninstallation scenario as well.

Overview

## Browser security best practices

Using servers for Internet browsing does not adhere to sound security practices because Internet browsing increases the exposure of your server to potential security attacks. Regardless of the browser you use, you should restrict browsing on your server.

To reduce the risk to your server of potential attacks from malicious Web-based content:

* Do not use servers for browsing general Web content.
* Use client computers to download drivers, service packs, and other updates.
* Do not view Web sites that you cannot confirm are secure.
* Use a limited user account instead of an administrator account for general Web browsing.
* Use Group Policy to keep unauthorized users from making inappropriate changes to browser security settings.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
