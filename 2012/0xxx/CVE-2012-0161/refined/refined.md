{
  "CVE-2012-0161": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft .NET Framework due to the improper serialization of untrusted input through partially trusted assemblies.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework improperly handles an exception during the object serialization process.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper serialization of untrusted input.",
        "Improper handling of exceptions during object serialization.",
	"Bypassing Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web browsing scenario: An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XAML browser application (XBAP).",
        "Windows .NET applications attack scenario: This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability. For the web browsing attack vector, the attacker would have to convince a user to visit a malicious website. For the .NET application attack, the attacker would need to be able to execute a malicious .NET application.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects the .NET Framework serialization process when handling untrusted data. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Microsoft .NET Framework handles object serialization. This vulnerability also bypasses Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions."
