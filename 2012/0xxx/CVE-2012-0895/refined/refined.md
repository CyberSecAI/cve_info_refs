Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-0895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `count-per-day` WordPress plugin's `download.php` and `map/map.php` files. Specifically, the `download.php` script allowed arbitrary file downloads due to insufficient input validation, and `map/map.php` was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Download:** The `download.php` script directly used user-supplied input (`$_GET['f']`) to construct a file path without proper sanitization or validation. This allowed an attacker to specify any file on the server (that the webserver user had access to) and download it.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `map/map.php` script used user-supplied input (`$_GET['map']`) without proper sanitization. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Download:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the server, such as configuration files, database credentials, or other application code, by downloading arbitrary files.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to various impacts, such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing session cookies
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Potentially performing other actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Download:** The attack vector is via HTTP GET request to `download.php` with the `f` parameter set to the path of the file they want to download.
    Example:  `192.168.0.1/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/download.php?n=1&f=/etc/passwd`
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attack vector is via HTTP GET request to `map/map.php` with the `map` parameter containing malicious javascript code.
    Example: `192.168.0.1/wp-content/plugins/count-per-day/map/map.php?map='")); </script><img src=http://www.bing.com//az/hprichbg?p=rb%2fOrcaWhales_ROW818916751.jpg>'`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
*   The attacker does not need any specific credentials or elevated privileges.
*   The attacker only needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content indicates that the vulnerabilities were present in versions of the `count-per-day` plugin prior to 3.1.1.
*   The plugin author addressed the vulnerabilities in version 3.1.1 by adding input validation and sanitization.
*   The fix involved restricting the downloadable file extensions in `download.php` and using `strip_tags` to remove HTML from the  `$_GET['map']` parameter before usage, in multiple php files.
*   The plugin is now closed and no longer available for download.
