# WordPress 3.3.1 Security and Maintenance Release

---

WordPress 3.3.1 is now available. This maintenance release fixes [15 issues](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&milestone=3.3.1&group=resolution&order=priority) with WordPress 3.3, as well as a fix for a cross-site scripting vulnerability that affected version 3.3. Thanks to Joshua H., Hoang T., Stefan Zimmerman, Chris K., and the Go Daddy security team for responsibly disclosing the bug to our security team.

[Download 3.3.1](https://wordpress.org/download/) or visit Dashboard → Updates in your site admin.
