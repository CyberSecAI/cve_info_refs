Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from ALFTP's insecure method of determining how to load executable files. Specifically, when a user attempts to open a file without an extension (e.g., `README`), ALFTP incorrectly executes a file with the same name but with an `.exe` extension (e.g., `README.exe`), if it exists in the same directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Loading:** The application prioritizes files with `.exe` extensions over files without extensions, even when the user intends to open the latter.
*   **Incorrect File Handling:** The software does not properly differentiate between files with the same base name but differing extensions, leading to the execution of the wrong file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ALFTP application.
*   **Malware Delivery:** By placing a malicious `.exe` file in the same directory as a file a user is likely to open, an attacker can trick the user into executing the malicious file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (Internet) Based:** An attacker can exploit this over the internet using crafted packets
*   **Local File System:**  The vulnerability can be exploited if an attacker can place a malicious executable (e.g., `README.exe`) on the same directory as a legitimate file, then trick a user into opening the non executable file, which the application will interpret as the malicious one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to place a malicious executable:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious executable file with the same name but .exe extension as a non-executable file the user will be tempted to open in a directory accessible by the user through ALFTP.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be convinced to take a standard action that doesn't feel harmful, such as clicking a link or opening a file that will trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity according to CVSS v2.
*   The vendor, ESTsoft Corp., has acknowledged the vulnerability and provided a fix in version 5.31 of the ALFTP software.
*   The vulnerability was reported to IPA by Fumihiko Sano.
*   The JVN entry for this vulnerability is JVN#85695061.
*   The JVN iPedia entry for this vulnerability is JVNDB-2012-000011.
