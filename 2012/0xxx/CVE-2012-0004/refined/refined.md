{
  "CVE-2012-0004": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused when filters in DirectShow do not properly handle specially crafted media files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of specially crafted media files by DirectShow filters."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights if the user is logged in with administrative privileges. Users with fewer user rights could be less impacted but are still at risk.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Email: Sending a specially crafted media file to a user and convincing them to open it.",
      "Web-based: Hosting a website containing a specially crafted media file, or placing the file on compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted media file. They also need to convince the user to open the malicious file. This could be done through social engineering via email or by directing them to a website hosting the malicious content."
  }
