  "CVE-2012-0173": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Remote Desktop Protocol accesses an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Remote Desktop Protocol processes a sequence of specially crafted packets, resulting in the access of an object in memory that has not been properly initialized or has been deleted.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory access",
      "Incorrect object initialization/deletion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote Code Execution on the target system, allowing the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a sequence of specially crafted RDP packets to the target system"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.",
