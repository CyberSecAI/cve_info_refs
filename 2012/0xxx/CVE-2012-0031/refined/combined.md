| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:05:13 UTC  ``` A flaw [1] was found in mod_log_config.  If an administrator configured the "%{cookiename}C" log format string to be used, a remote attacker could send a specific cookie which would cause a crash.  This crash would only be a denial of service if using a threaded MPM (such as event or worker).  Note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora use the prefork MPM by default.  This will be fixed upstream [2] in 2.2.22 and affects versions 2.2.17 up to and including 2.2.21.  [1] <https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=52256> [2] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1227292>   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:07:02 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 785067](show_bug.cgi?id=785067 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2012-0021 httpd: crash in mod_log_config [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-28 06:13:13 UTC  ``` ====================================================== Name: [CVE-2012-0021](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0021)  The log_cookie function in mod_log_config.c in the mod_log_config module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.17 through 2.2.21, when a threaded MPM is used, does not properly handle a %{}C format string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a cookie that lacks both a name and a value.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-29 17:32:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c0)) > This will be fixed upstream [2] in 2.2.22 and affects versions 2.2.17 up to and > including 2.2.21.

| Log Message: | ``` SECURITY (CVE-2012-0031): Fix possible crash on shutdown if a child changes the sb_type field in the scoreboard.  Since unprivileged children should not be able to affect the parent in this way, this is treated as a Low severity security issue.  Thanks to "halfdog" <me halfdog.net> for reporting this issue.  * include/scoreboard.h (global_score): Remove sb_type field.  * include/ap_mmn.h: Bump MMN for above.  * server/scoreboard.c (ap_cleanup_scoreboard, ap_create_scoreboard):   Use a static global to store store the scoreboard type.   ``` |

# RHSA-2011:1391 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A1391)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues and one bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1245 update

introduced regressions in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects those regressions. (BZ#736592)

All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:27:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the default error response for status code 400.  This could be used by an attacker to expose "httpOnly" cookies, when no custom ErrorDocument was specified.  This affects all versions of Apache from 2.2.0 up to and including 2.2.21.  It will be fixed upstream in 2.2.22 (via r1235454 [1]).  [1] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1235454>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:33:29 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 785070](show_bug.cgi?id=785070 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2012-0053 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0021 CVE-2011-3607 httpd: multiple vulnerabilities [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-28 06:13:41 UTC  ``` ====================================================== Name: [CVE-2012-0053](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0053)  protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-29 14:52:53 UTC  ``` Upstream fix (linked in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)) changes the amount of information sent back to an HTTP client when httpd detects one of the following problems:  1) HTTP request header line is longer than configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds the line (actually, a prefix of it read before reaching the limit) to its default 400 error page.  2) HTTP request header line is continuation of the previous line and both lines combined together exceed configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds previous line to its default 400 error page.  Note: previous line here may refer to a concatenation of more than one line, if previous lines were continuations too.  3) HTTP request header line does not contain : , which is a separator between the header name and its value.  Case 1) is the one that can be used by malicious javascript to gain access to httpOnly cookies.  A script can set additional cookies to make Cookie: request header line length exceed LimitRequestFieldSize and read values of a httpOnly protected cookies from the httpd's error page.  This may allow a script injected via some XSS flaw to gain access to cookies it can not access directly.  Upstream fix ensures that error page only contains header name, or 80 character prefix of the header name, if the name exceeds that limit.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-02-01 08:20:33 UTC  ``` Write up of the issue for the original reporter:   <http://fd.the-wildcat.de/apache_e36a9cf46c.php>  It confirms the analysis above ([comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c10)  Denis    2012-02-20 14:29:13 UTC  ``` Is httpd-2.2.3-53  impacted by the issue httpd-2.2.3-53 ?

Hi Blair,   We are working towards addressing of this issue in various versions of JBoss Enterprise Web Server too. But unfortunately as of right now we are unable to provide exact release date, when the updates can be expected (as the final date is subject of change depending on couple of internal conditions).  Hope the above being sufficient and helpful. Apologize, but can't provide more exact information.

It should also be noted that this is not an issue by itself.  This can only be exploited via some other cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw found in a web application running on the server and may allow injected JavaScript to gain access to HttpOnly cookies, if the application uses this protection for its cookies.   ``` |  |

RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2012-05-07
Updated:
2012-05-07
# RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the Apache HTTP Server component for JBoss Enterprise Web
Server 1.0.2 that fixes multiple security issues and one bug is now
available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1330 update

introduced a regression in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects this regression. (BZ#749071)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Web Server installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The Apache HTTP Server must be restarted for this update to take effect.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0542)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
now available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1329 update

introduced a regression in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects this regression. (BZ#749071)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 should upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
After installing the updated packages, users must restart the httpd
service for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2405-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Stefan Fritsch
February 06, 2012                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3607 CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317
                 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0053

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:

CVE-2011-3607:

  An integer overflow in ap_pregsub() could allow local attackers to
  execute arbitrary code at elevated privileges via crafted .htaccess
  files.

CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317:

  The Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the request URI for
  proxied requests. In certain reverse proxy configurations using the
  ProxyPassMatch directive or using the RewriteRule directive with the
  [P] flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy connect to an
  arbitrary server. The could allow the attacker to access internal
  servers that are not otherwise accessible from the outside.

  The three CVE ids denote slightly different variants of the same
  issue.

  Note that, even with this issue fixed, it is the responsibility of
  the administrator to ensure that the regular expression replacement
  pattern for the target URI does not allow a client to append arbitrary
  strings to the host or port parts of the target URI. For example, the
  configuration

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(.*)  <http://internal-host$1>

  is still insecure and should be replaced by one of the following
  configurations:

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(/.*)  <http://internal-host$1>
    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail/(.*)  [http://internal-host/$1](http://internal-host/%241)

CVE-2012-0031:

  An apache2 child process could cause the parent process to crash
  during shutdown. This is a violation of the privilege separation
  between the apache2 processes and could potentially be used to worsen
  the impact of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2012-0053:

  The response message for error code 400 (bad request) could be used to
  expose "httpOnly" cookies. This could allow a remote attacker using
  cross site scripting to steal authentication cookies.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.9-10+lenny12.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.16-6+squeeze6

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

This update also contains updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which have
been recompiled against the updated apache2 packages. The new version
number for the oldstable distribution is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny7. In the
stable distribution, apache2-mpm-itk has the same version number as
apache2.

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix two security issues and one bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1245 update

introduced regressions in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects those regressions. (BZ#736592)

All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2011-3368 (released via
RHSA-2011:1391) did not completely address the problem. An attacker could
bypass the fix and make a reverse proxy connect to an arbitrary server not
directly accessible to the attacker by sending an HTTP version 0.9 request,
or by using a specially-crafted URI. (CVE-2011-3639, CVE-2011-4317)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

# Introduction

Apache 2.2 webservers may use a shared memory segment to share
child process status information (scoreboard) between the child
processes and the parent process running as root. A child running
with lower privileges than the parent process might trigger an
invalid free in the privileged parent process during parent shutdown
by modifying data on the shared memory segment.

# Method

A child process can trigger the bug by changing the value of
*ap\_scoreboard\_e sb\_type*, which resides in the *global\_score*
structure on the shared memory segment. The value is usually
2 (SB\_SHARED):

typedef struct {
int server\_limit;
int thread\_limit;
ap\_scoreboard\_e sb\_type;
ap\_generation\_t running\_generation; /\* the generation of children which
\* should still be serving requests.
\*/
apr\_time\_t restart\_time;
int lb\_limit;
} global\_score;

When changing the scoreboard type of a shared memory segment to
something else, the root process will try to release the shared
memory using free during normal shutdown. Since the memory was
allocated using *mmap*, not *malloc*, the call to *free*
from *ap\_cleanup\_scoreboard* (server/scoreboard.c) triggers
abort within libc.

apr\_status\_t ap\_cleanup\_scoreboard(void \*d)
{
if (ap\_scoreboard\_image == NULL) {
return APR\_SUCCESS;
}
if (ap\_scoreboard\_image->global->sb\_type == SB\_SHARED) {
ap\_cleanup\_shared\_mem(NULL);
}
else {
free(ap\_scoreboard\_image->global);
free(ap\_scoreboard\_image);
ap\_scoreboard\_image = NULL;
}
return APR\_SUCCESS;
}

Abort output is written to apache default error log:

[Fri Dec 30 10:19:57 2011] [notice] caught SIGTERM, shutting down

======= Memory map: ========
00110000-00286000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 132367

To reproduce, attach to a www-data (non-root) child process and
increment the value at offset 0x10 in the shared memory segment.
The search and replace can also be accomplished by compiling
<LibScoreboardTest.c> and loading
it into a child process using *gdb --pid [childpid]* and
following commands:

set \*(int\*)($esp+4)="/var/www/libExploit.so"
set \*(int\*)($esp+8)=1
set $eip=\*\_\_libc\_dlopen\_mode
continue

Without gdb, the [mod\_setenv exploit demo (2nd attempt)](../ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/DemoExploit.html) could be used to load the code.

# Impact

The impact is very low. Another libc implementation might use
the pointer and free another memory chunk, but since apache is
shutting down, use-after-free exploitation would be very hard.

Syscall trace during shutdown shows, that at least with default
configuration, no essential shutdown steps are left out: removal
of pid file and cgisock.xxx are done before the crash. Hence the
crash should not leave system in some inconsistent state, but special
high availability or IDS scenarios might trigger response to root
process crash.

There is a chance to take over the apache root process when run
within *broken chroot environment*, where libgcc\_s.so.1 is
writable or missing but one of the library search path locations
is writeable by lower privileged process. The abort in libc causes
the loading of libgcc\_s.so.1 shared library, which, when replaced by the
lower privileged process, will lead to code execution in the root
process:

writev(2, [{"\*\*\* glibc detected \*\*\* ", 23}, {"/usr/sbin/apache2", 17}, {": ", 2}, {"free(): invalid pointer", 23}, {": 0x", 4}, {"b76f4008", 8}, {" \*\*\*\n", 5}], 7) = 82

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:05:13 UTC  ``` A flaw [1] was found in mod_log_config.  If an administrator configured the "%{cookiename}C" log format string to be used, a remote attacker could send a specific cookie which would cause a crash.  This crash would only be a denial of service if using a threaded MPM (such as event or worker).  Note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora use the prefork MPM by default.  This will be fixed upstream [2] in 2.2.22 and affects versions 2.2.17 up to and including 2.2.21.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c0)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-22 13:44:51 UTC  ``` Vincent Danen 2011-11-02 17:14:55 EDT  It was reported [1] that an integer overflow was found in Apache in the ap_pregsub() function called from mod-setenvif.  When a header field is mangled using SetEnvIf, the new environment variable data can be multiples of the size of the submitted header field.  This would cause ap_pregsub() to overflow the length value in buffer size calculations, leading to the subsequent allocation call of a too-small buffer.  Filling this buffer with user-supplied data will lead to a buffer overflow.  Depending on the input data, this can lead to excessive allocation of server memory (resulting in killed processes due to out-of-memory conditions), invalid memory access when copying large amounts of data (which can lead to a termination of the httpd process), or possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code.  To trigger this flaw, mod_setenvif must be enabled (the default) and the attacker needs to be able to place a crafted .htaccess file on the server (which, in most cases, would require local access to the file system or some web interface that allows for writing arbitrary files to the local file system, such as for custom .htaccess files).  There is currently no upstream fix, however to work around the problem, disable mod_setenvif.  [1] <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-12 10:06:25 UTC  ``` This issue was originally tracked with [CVE-2011-4415](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4415) via [bug #750935](show_bug.cgi?id=750935 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2011-4415 httpd: SetEnvIf resource exhaustion").  Patch for this issue was added upstream to trunk (future 2.4.x httpd versions) via following commit:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1198940>  That fix is not applicable to older httpd versions, such as 2.2.x.  There still on-going upstream discussion on how to address this in older httpd versions:   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46260>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c2)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-24 14:49:21 UTC  ``` There are still no follow up on this discussion.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-26 14:46:10 UTC  ``` Following fix is already committed in upstream SVN for 2.2.x:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1227280>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c4)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-27 09:02:09 UTC  ``` Theese are the only exploits/reproducers currently available/released for this: <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/DemoExploit.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-21 21:58:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0323 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0323.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:48:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:0543 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0543.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 19:17:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0542.html>   ``` |  |
