## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2663830)

Published: May 08, 2012 | Updated: May 09, 2012

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and five privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Office file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Microsoft Office for Mac 2011; it is also rated Important for supported versions of Microsoft Excel Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Microsoft Excel validates data when opening specially crafted Excel files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**How is this security update related to MS12-029?**
The security update packages for Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB2665346) and Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 (KB2665351) offered in this bulletin also address the vulnerabilities described in the [MS12-029](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=248419) security bulletin.

**Why is this update only rated Important for all affected versions of Excel?**

Microsoft Excel 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerabilities from Critical to Important because the vulnerabilities require more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

**The attack vector for the vulnerability is through Microsoft** **Excel. Why is** **this a** **Microsoft Office update?**

Although the attack vector for the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin is only through affected versions of Microsoft Excel, the vulnerable code is contained in a shared component of Microsoft Office. Other Microsoft Office software, including some supported releases of Microsoft Access, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft PowerPoint contain the vulnerable shared component of Microsoft Office, but because they do not access the vulnerable code, they are not affected by this vulnerability. However, since the vulnerable code is present, this update will be offered.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**Why are multiple package updates available for Microsoft** **Office** **2007** **Service Pack 2, Microsoft Office 2007** **Service Pack 3, Microsoft** **Office** **2010, and Microsoft** **Office** **2010 Service Pack 1?**

The updates required to address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are offered across different package updates as indicated in the **Affected Software** table due to the componentized servicing model for Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010. To be protected from the vulnerabilities, both updates are required, but they do not need to be installed in a particular order.

**What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack are updated by this bulletin?**

The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the Microsoft Excel component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack.

**How** **areMicrosoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?**

A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Excel is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft Excel that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.

**The** **Microsoft Office component discussed in this article is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers.

## Excel File Format Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0141

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-0141](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-0141).

#### Mitigating Factors for Excel File Format Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0141

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains an Excel file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.

#### Workarounds for Excel File Format Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0141

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block** **policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  Microsoft Office File Block policy can be used to block specific file format types from opening in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.

  **For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007**

  The following registry scripts can be saved in registry entry (.reg) files and used to set the File Block policy. For more information on how to use registry scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310516](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/310516).

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied. In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.

  | Microsoft Office Software | Registry Script |
  | --- | --- |
  | Microsoft Excel 2003 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001\ |
  | Microsoft Excel 2007 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001 |

  **For Microsoft Office 2010**

  Open Microsoft Excel 2010 and perform the following steps:

  1. Click the **File** tab.
  2. Under **Help**, click **Options**.
  3. Click **Trust Center**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.
  4. In the Trust Center, click **File Block Settings**.
  5. Ensure the **Open** check box is selected for the following file types:

     In Microsoft Excel 2010:

     + Excel 2007 and later Binary Workbooks
     + Excel 97-2003 Add-in Files
     + Excel 97-2003 Workbooks and Templates
     + Excel 95-97 Workbooks and Templates
     + Excel 95 Workbooks
     + Excel 4 Workbooks
     + Excel 4 Worksheets
     + Excel 3 Worksheets
     + Excel 2 Worksheets
  6. Under **Open behavior for selected file types**, select **Do not open selected file types** or select **Open selected file types in Protected View**. Either choice will block the attack vector to the vulnerable code.
  7. Click **OK** to apply the File Block Settings.

  Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, [Plan file block settings for Office 2010](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179230.aspx).

  **Impact of workaround.** For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For Microsoft Office 2010, Office 2003 files or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected. For more information about the impact of file block setting in Microsoft Office software, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922850](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922850).

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, use the following registry scripts to undo the settings used to set the File Block policy:

| Microsoft Office Software | Registry Script |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Excel 2003 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000 |
| Microsoft Excel 2007 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000 |

For Microsoft Office 2010, open Microsoft Excel 2010 and perform the following steps:

1. Click the **File** tab.

#### Workarounds for Excel File Format Memory Corruption in OBJECTLINK Record Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0142

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block** **policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  Microsoft Office File Block policy can be used to block specific file format types from opening in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.

  **For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007**

  The following registry scripts can be saved in registry entry (.reg) files and used to set the File Block policy. For more information on how to use registry scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310516](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/310516).

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied. In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.

| Microsoft Office Software | Registry Script |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Excel 2003 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001\ |
| Microsoft Excel 2007 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001 |

```

#### FAQ for Excel SXLI Record Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0184

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles memory when opening specially crafted Excel files.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Excel is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Excel validates data when opening specially crafted Excel files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Excel MergeCells Record Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0185

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

#### Mitigating Factors for Excel MergeCells Record Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0185

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains an Excel file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1847](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1847).

#### Mitigating Factors for Excel Series Record Parsing Type Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1847

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains an Excel file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.

#### Workarounds for Excel Series Record Parsing Type Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1847

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block** **policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  Microsoft Office File Block policy can be used to block specific file format types from opening in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.

  **For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007**

  The following registry scripts can be saved in registry entry (.reg) files and used to set the File Block policy. For more information on how to use registry scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310516](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/310516).

  **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied. In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.

| Microsoft Office Software | Registry Script |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Excel 2003 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001\ |
| Microsoft Excel 2007 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001 |

```
**For Microsoft Office 2010**

Open Microsoft Excel 2010 and perform the following steps:

1.  Click the **File** tab.
2.  Under **Help**, click **Options**.
3.  Click **Trust Center**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.
4.  In the Trust Center, click **File Block Settings**.
5.  Ensure the **Open** check box is selected for the following file types:

    In Microsoft Excel 2010:
    - Excel 2007 and later Binary Workbooks
    - Excel 97-2003 Add-in Files
    - Excel 97-2003 Workbooks and Templates
    - Excel 95-97 Workbooks and Templates
    - Excel 95 Workbooks
    - Excel 4 Workbooks
    - Excel 4 Worksheets
    - Excel 3 Worksheets
    - Excel 2 Worksheets
6.  Under **Open behavior for selected file types**, select **Do not open selected file types** or select **Open selected file types in Protected View**. Either choice will block the attack vector to the vulnerable code.
7.  Click **OK** to apply the File Block Settings.

Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, [Plan file block settings for Office 2010](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179230.aspx).

**Impact of workaround.** For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For Microsoft Office 2010, Office 2003 files or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected. For more information about the impact of file block setting in Microsoft Office software, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922850](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922850).

**How to undo the workaround.**

For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, use the following registry scripts to undo the settings used to set the File Block policy:

```

| Microsoft Office Software | Registry Script |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft Excel 2003 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000 |
| Microsoft Excel 2007 | Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\ \ [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]\ \ "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000 |

```
For Microsoft Office 2010, open Microsoft Excel 2010 and perform the following steps:

1.  Click the **File** tab.
2.  Under **Help**, click **Options**.
3.  Click **Trust Center**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.
4.  In the Trust Center, click **File Block Settings**.
5.  Clear the **Open** check box for the file types that you previously selected.
6.  Click **OK** to apply the File Block settings.

```

* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.

  To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en).

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx) to install all recommended updates.

  **Enable MOICE**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.

| Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler |
| --- |
| For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document |
| For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet\ ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template\ ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin |
| For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show\ ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow |

```
**Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the Microsoft Office 2007 Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

**How to undo the workaround.** Run the commands to disable MOICE as specified in the table below.

```

| Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- |
| For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8 |
| For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8\ ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template\ ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin |
| For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8\ ASSOC .pot=PowerPoint.Template.8\ ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8 |

```
**Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.

```

* **Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources**

  Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for Excel Series Record Parsing Type Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1847

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles memory when opening specially crafted Excel files.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later version be installed on the system.

To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft websites:

* [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang;=en)
* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** or **/help** | Displays usage dialog. |
| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/lang:<LCID>** | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language. |
| **/log:<log file>** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs item in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs item in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
