  "CVE-2012-0141": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles memory when opening specially crafted Excel files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper validation of data in Excel files"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Email: Attacker sends a specially crafted Excel file to the user.",
       "Web-based attack: Attacker hosts a website containing a specially crafted Excel file, and convinces users to visit the website and open the malicious file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Excel file and convince a user to open it. This can be done via email or through a website.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Microsoft Excel 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document, reducing the vulnerability severity from Critical to Important."
