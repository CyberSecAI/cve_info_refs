Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-0847:

**CVE-2012-0847**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing check in the `avfilter_filter_samples()` function within the `lavfi` component of FFmpeg. This function is related to audio filtering.

*   **Weakness:** The missing check allows for an out-of-bounds write, leading to a heap buffer overflow.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The vulnerability can lead to memory corruption on the heap. While the description suggests that the audio filters weren't heavily used at the time, meaning it might not be practically exploitable, it still poses a risk depending on how an application uses FFmpeg. Successful exploitation could lead to crashes or potentially more severe security consequences if further exploited.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when FFmpeg processes specially crafted audio data containing parameters that will cause the out-of-bounds write.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious audio file that triggers the vulnerability to the FFmpeg library. The attacker would need no special privileges within the system unless the vulnerable application was already running with elevated rights.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided text notes that this specific issue "probably is not practically exploitable" due to lack of widespread use of audio filters within FFmpeg at that time. This does not mean the vulnerability is negligible, but should be considered when assessing risk.
* The fix for this vulnerability is identified as commit `ae21776207e8a2bbe268e7c9e203f7599dd87ddb`
* This CVE is one of many issues found and fixed within the FFmpeg 0.9.1 release as demonstrated by the lists provided.
