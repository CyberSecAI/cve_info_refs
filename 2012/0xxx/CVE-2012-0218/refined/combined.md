How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```

Package        : xen
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0217 CVE-2012-0218 CVE-2012-2934

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Xen, a hypervisor.

CVE-2012-0217
	Xen does not properly handle uncanonical return addresses on
	Intel amd64 CPUs, allowing amd64 PV guests to elevate to
	hypervisor privileges.  AMD processors, HVM and i386 guests
	are not affected.

CVE-2012-0218
	Xen does not properly handle SYSCALL and SYSENTER instructions
	in PV guests, allowing unprivileged users inside a guest
	system to crash the guest system.

CVE-2012-2934
	Xen does not detect old AMD CPUs affected by AMD Erratum #121.

For CVE-2012-2934, Xen refuses to start domUs on affected systems
unless the "allow_unsafe" option is passed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.1-5.2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version
4.1.3~rc1+hg-20120614.a9c0a89c08f2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

Previous versions were embargoed.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  When guest user code running inside a Xen guest operating system attempts to execute a syscall or sysenter instruction, but when the guest operating system has not registered a handler for that instruction, a General Protection Fault may need to be injected into the guest.  It has been discovered that the code in Xen which does this fails to clear a flag requesting exception injection, with the result that a future exception taken by the guest and handled entirely inside Xen will also be injected into the guest despite Xen having handled it already, probably crashing the guest.  IMPACT ======  User space processes on some guest operating systems may be able to crash the guest.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  HVM guests are not vulnerable.  32- and 64-bit PV guests may be vulnerable, depending on the CPU hardware, the guest operating system, and its exact kernel version and configuration.  MITIGATION ==========  This issue can be mitigated by running HVM (fully-virtualised).  In some cases this issue can be mitigated by upgrading the guest kernel to one which installs hooks for sysenter and/or syscall, as applicable.  RESOLUTION ==========  Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.  These patches also resolve the (more serious) issue described in XSA-7 (CVE-2012-0217).  These changes have been made to the staging Xen repositories:                     XSA-7:              XSA-8:  xen-unstable.hg     25480:76eaf5966c05  25200:80f4113be500+25204:569d6f05e1ef  xen-4.1-testing.hg  23299:f08e61b9b33f  23300:0fec1afa4638  xen-4.0-testing.hg  21590:dd367837e089  21591:adb943a387c8  xen-3.4-testing.hg  19996:894aa06e4f79  19997:ddb7578abb89  PATCH INFORMATION =================  The attached patches resolve both this issue and that reported in XSA-7 (CVE-2012-0217).   xen-unstable 25204:569d6f05e1ef or later    xsa7-xsa8-unstable-recent.patch    xen-unstable 25199:6092641e3644 or earlier  xsa7-xsa8-unstable-apr16.patch  Xen 4.1, 4.1.x                              xsa7-xsa8-xen-4.1.patch  Xen 4.0, 4.0.x                              xsa7-xsa8-xen-4.0.patch  Xen 3.4, 3.4.x                              xsa7-xsa8-xen-3.4.patch  $ sha256sum xsa7-xsa8-*patch 00853d799d24af16b17c8bbbdb5bb5144a8a7fad31467c4be3d879244774f8d2   xsa7-xsa8-unstable-apr16.patch 71f9907a58c1a1cd601d8088faf8791923d78f77065b94dba8df2a61f512530d   xsa7-xsa8-unstable-recent.patch 55fb925a7f4519ea31a0bc42d3ee83093bb7abd98b3a0e4f58591f1ae738840a   xsa7-xsa8-xen-3.4.patch 6a7e39121ec1f134351fdf34f494d108500aaa4190a9f7965e81c4e96270924e   xsa7-xsa8-xen-4.0.patch 52d8288718b4a833eb437fd18d92b7d412fbe01900dbd0b437744a1df4d459da   xsa7-xsa8-xen-4.1.patch  NOTE REGARDING EMBARGO ======================  The fix for this issue has already been published as xen-unstable.hg changesets 25200:80f4113be500 and 25204:569d6f05e1ef.  However, this has not been flagged as a security problem, and since the affected area of code is the same as that for XSA-7 (CVE-2012-0217), we have concluded that this advisory should be under the same embargo as XSA-7. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.10 (GNU/Linux)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJP1yqMAAoJEIP+FMlX6CvZQRoH/1Do71YkaMvKoPo/VCHqUuB1 5mJve/SiTK5Y5kggnLfnpZeuLjlntHCT5F//Do7N21WDVdwZXFBItlvjhKyNGA0Y ohqzqzAQ0c2l/mE3ToaLhhtuFb8U06q8Ud+pQ9QbMHHpJvGXPzDbNG12L/fZDwyf ZbMqB2j8+TVuRXPlbdZabNUAcZ+HOJHb1NloKCbX0qwMG4p5FJ3OdkDX7r5OjPKj sIJAaltBINGjRrqYMLB4UUQdrftu1ftfU/GFVYy8+t3uNj0fBgkCPUlGbbQs2SF2 +VtLUUG6rzVlRdHyhVMswz3sZtR7Tow6xwPk3Sr4yfrI15rH2pUJI7if8vZ1ZQ8= =elZi -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----   ```  **Attachment: [xsa7-xsa8-unstable-recent.patch](binV1i_PWiPEk.bin)** *Description:* Binary data  **Attachment: [xsa7-xsa8-unstable-apr16.patch](bin2K9GOzJm6_.bin)** *Description:* Binary data  **Attachment: [xsa7-xsa8-xen-4.1.patch](binOgJfU3VUcj.bin)** *Description:* Binary data  **Attachment: [xsa7-xsa8-xen-4.0.patch](binyGHoyc_UkF.bin)** *Description:* Binary data  **Attachment: [xsa7-xsa8-xen-3.4.patch](binwNpQpek9Yw.bin)** *Description:* Binary data  ``` _______________________________________________ Xen-announce mailing list Xen-announce@xxxxxxxxxxxxx <http://lists.xen.org/xen-announce> ```    ---      * Prev by Date:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 7 (CVE-2012-0217) - PV privilege escalation](msg00001.html)** * Next by Date:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 9 (CVE-2012-2934) - PV guest host DoS (AMD erratum #121)](msg00002.html)** * Previous by thread:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 7 (CVE-2012-0217) - PV privilege escalation](msg00001.html)** * Next by thread:   **[[Xen-announce] Xen Security Advisory 9 (CVE-2012-2934) - PV guest host DoS (AMD erratum #121)](msg00002.html)** * Index(es):   + [**Date**](index.html#00003)   + [**Thread**](threads.html#00003) |
