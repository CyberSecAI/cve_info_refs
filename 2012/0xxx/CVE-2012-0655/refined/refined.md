The provided document describes the security content of OS X Lion v10.7.4 and Security Update 2012-002, including a fix for CVE-2012-0655.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `libsecurity` component, which was accepting certificates signed with insecure-length RSA keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is the acceptance of RSA keys with lengths less than 1024 bits, which are considered insecure and can be vulnerable to attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability could expose users to spoofing and information disclosure, as certificates with weak RSA keys could be used to impersonate legitimate entities.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft malicious X.509 certificates using weak RSA keys and attempt to use them to compromise the security of systems using the vulnerable `libsecurity` component. This could occur when visiting a malicious website or interacting with other untrusted content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create or obtain a malicious certificate signed with a weak RSA key. The attacker would then need to present the malicious certificate to a system using the vulnerable `libsecurity` library, such as when connecting to a malicious server or website.
