# Removing the DefaultApplication template scripts from the WebSphere Application Server profile for ClearQuest Web

### Troubleshooting

## Problem

The IBM WebSphere Application Server where IBM Rational ClearQuest is deployed contains some testing and debugging scripts and sample applications. Some of these scripts and applications provide information such as system paths and versions. You can remove these sample scripts and applications from a production environment to prevent malicious attacks created by using the information obtained from the target host.

## Symptom

There are no adverse symptoms apparent to ClearQuest users.

## Cause

The IBM Installation Manager deploys ClearQuest Web into the WebSphere Application Server profile by using a WebSphere Application Server default template. The default template places some sample testing and debugging scripts and sample applications on the server.

## Diagnosing The Problem

The following sample scripts and applications might be included in your WebSphere Application Server profile for ClearQuest Web. These scripts might also be referenced in the `plugin-cfg.xml` file for IBM HTTP Server (IHS) and WebSphere Application Server:

## Resolving The Problem

Depending on your business and security requirements, the following configuration changes might be appropriate to remove, disable, or hide the sample scripts and applications that are included with the WebSphere Application Server default template.
