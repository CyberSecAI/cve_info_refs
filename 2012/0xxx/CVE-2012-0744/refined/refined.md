Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0744:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of sample scripts in the WebSphere Application Server profile when deploying IBM Rational ClearQuest Web. These scripts are part of the default WebSphere Application Server template and are not necessary for ClearQuest functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The sample scripts may expose sensitive information, such as system paths and versions, which could aid an attacker in crafting further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could leverage the information gleaned from these scripts to gain a better understanding of the target system's configuration and potentially exploit other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web server, where the sample scripts are accessible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the web server hosting the ClearQuest application and the vulnerable sample scripts.

**Summary of Relevant Details:**

*   The issue is related to sample scripts deployed with the WebSphere Application Server when installing ClearQuest Web, not the ClearQuest application itself.
*   The unnecessary sample scripts expose information that could be used to assist an attacker.
*   A fix is available in Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 4 (8.0.0.4) and later.
*   A workaround is available: manually removing the sample scripts as described in technote 1599361.
*   The vulnerability affects all supported ClearQuest Web platforms.
