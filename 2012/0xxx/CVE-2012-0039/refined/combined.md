| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=772720#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-09 19:08:46 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] (and the original report [2]) that glib2 also suffers from algorithmic complexity attacks as described in oCERT-2011-003.  While this was originally reported to upstream in 2003, it does not look as though anything was done to correct the problem.  According to the Debian report, current glib2 is still vulnerable.  Doing a lookup on other g_str_hash() functions, the following packages may also be vulnerable if they copied code from glib2:  arts-1.5.10/flow/gsl/gslglib.c:172: guint g_str_hash (gconstpointer key) gettext-0.17/gettext-tools/gnulib-lib/glib/gstring.c:97: g_str_hash (gconstpointer v) pkg-config-0.23/glib-1.2.10/gstring.c:72: g_str_hash (gconstpointer key)  In addition to the above, the following are also in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4:  glib-2.12.9/glib/gstring.c:91: g_str_hash (gconstpointer v) (in frysk) glib-2.12.3/glib/gstring.c:91: g_str_hash (gconstpointer v) (in evolution28-glib2)  And Fedora has a lot more:  glib-1.2.10/gstring.c:72: g_str_hash (gconstpointer key) gnucash-2.4.7/src/libqof/qof/qofutil.c:275: static guint g_str_hash_KEY(gconstpointer v) libspectrum-1.0.0/myglib/ghash.c:253: g_str_hash (gconstpointer v mono-2.10.5/eglib/src/ghashtable.c:598: g_str_hash (gconstpointer v1) gettext-0.17/gettext-tools/gnulib-lib/glib/gstring.c:97: g_str_hash (gconstpointer v) (in mingw32-gettext) gettext-0.17/gnulib-local/lib/glib/gstring.c:97: g_str_hash (gconstpointer v) (in mingw32-gettext) glib-2.28.6/glib/gstring.c:137: g_str_hash (gconstpointer v) (in mingw32-glib) nntpgrab-0.7.0/glue/glue_json.c:493: ng_str_hash (gconstpointer v) Pacemaker-1-1-Pacemaker-1.1.6/lib/common/utils.c:2627: g_str_hash_traditional(gconstpointer v) pacemaker-cloud-0.4.1/src/pcmk_pe.c:133: g_str_hash_traditional_copy(gconstpointer v) qof-0.7.5/qof/qofutil.c:363: g_str_hash_KEY (gconstpointer v) tucnak2-2.31/src/error.c:246: void dbg_str_hash(GHashTable *hash){  Some of these may be nothing, (just doing a search for functions with the string g_str_hash), but they probably need to be looked at to rule them out.  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=655044> [2] <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2003-May/msg00111.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=772720#c1)  Matthias Clasen    2012-01-10 13:51:54 UTC  ``` The hash function implemented by g_str_hash is part of the documented api, and cannot just be changed. Every user of GHashTable is free to use its own hash functions, they are not hardwired at all.  So I don't really see what fix there is in glib; if anything, it could offer an alternative string hash function.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=772720#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-12 02:24:28 UTC  ``` Do you know if upstream is discussing this further?  It looks like previously they had called for a volunteer to implement it, and no one ever responded (it didn't sound like it was technically a no-no, just probably quite painful to do).  I don't really know the best solution here, but we should perhaps get upstream involved in a conversation about how to deal with this (especially considering how old it is).  Maybe it is something that we just cannot (reasonably) fix?   ``` |  |

# Algorimic Complexity Attack on GLIB 2.2.1

```
Hello. We have analyzed this software to determine its vulnerability
to a new class of DoS attacks that related to a recent paper. ''Denial
of Service via Algorithmic Complexity Attacks.''

This paper discusses a new class of denial of service attacks that
work by exploiting the difference between average case performance and
worst-case performance. In an adversarial environment, the data
structures used by an application may be forced to experience their
worst case performance. For instance, hash tables are usually thought
of as being constant time operations, but with large numbers of
collisions will degrade to a linked list and may lead to a 100-10,000
times performance degradation. Because of the widespread use of hash
tables, the potential for attack is extremely widespread. Fortunately,
in many cases, other limits on the system limit the impact of these
attacks.

To be attackable, an application must have a deterministic or
predictable hash function and accept untrusted input. In general, for
the attack to be signifigant, the applications must be willing and
able to accept hundreds to tens of thousands of 'attack
inputs'. Because of that requirement, it is difficult to judge the
impact of these attack without knowing the source code extremely well,
and knowing all ways in which a program is used.

As part of this project, I have examined GLIB 2.2.1, and the hash
function 'g_str_hash' is deterministic. Thus, those who use it may
vulnerable to the attacks I discuss. Also, its design is such that
fast collisions are easy to generate. This means that *any* program
using glib that hashes a large number of keys from an untrusted source
is potentially subject to a severe performance degradation.
GTK-Gnutella would seem vulnerable, among others.

Depending on the application, this could be a critical DoS.

The solution for these attacks on hash tables is to make the hash
function unpredictable via a technique known as universal
hashing. Universal hashing is a keyed hash function where, based on
the key, one of a large set hash functions is chosen. When
benchmarking, we observe that for short or medium length inputs, it is
comparable in performance to simple predictable hash functions such as
the ones in Python or Perl. Our paper has graphs and charts of our
benchmarked performance.

I highly advise using a universal hashing library, either our own or
someone elses. As is historically seen, it is very easy to make silly
mistakes when attempting to implement your own 'secure' algorithm.

The abstract, paper, and a library implementing universal hashing is
available at   <http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/>.

The standard hashing functions provided with the ghashtable implementation
in glib are vulnerable to the algorithmic complexity attacks described in
oCert-2011-003

<http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html>

This was reported upstream in 2003 when Perl fixed their hashing
implementation by introducing a random hash seed. The upstream discussion
is archived here:

This discussion is from 2003 and had no real conclusion.
Have you checked if the current code base is still vulnerable?

Yes, I looked at their upstream repo and it appears to me that the
standard hashing functions still have this problem.

guint
g_str_hash (gconstpointer v)
{
  const signed char *p;
  guint32 h = 5381;

  for (p = v; *p != '\0'; p++)
    h = (h << 5) + h + *p;

  return h;
}

This is a harder to reverse than the standard "h = h * 33 + *p", but the
collisions are predictable.

The hash functions for int64 and double just truncate the keys.

```

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
