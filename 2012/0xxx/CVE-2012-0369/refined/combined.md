| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:L/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:UC/CDP:N/TD:N/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.

DATA + WPS   ```   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco WLCs and Cisco WiSMs are responsible for system-wide wireless LAN functions, such as security policies, intrusion prevention, RF management, quality of service (QoS), and mobility.      These devices communicate with controller-based access points over any Layer 2 (Ethernet) or Layer 3 (IP) infrastructure using the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) and the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol.      The Cisco WLC family of devices is affected by the following vulnerabilities:      **Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers HTTP Denial of Service Vulnerability**   The Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to crash by submitting a malformed URL to the administrative management interface.         Both HTTP and HTTPs are affected by this vulnerability.   This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCts81997](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts81997) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-0368.      **Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers IPv6 Denial of Service Vulnerability**   The Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability where an unauthenticated attacker could cause a device reload by sending a series of IPv6 packets.      The IPv6 pass-through feature is not affected by this vulnerability. Legitimate IPv6 traffic can trigger this vulnerability.      **Note**: Cisco 4400 Series WLC, Cisco Wireless Services Modules (WiSM), and Cisco Catalyst 3750G Integrated WLCs are not affected by this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtt07949](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtt07949) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-0369.      **Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers WebAuth Denial of Service Vulnerability**   The Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability where an unauthenticated attacker could cause a device reload by sending a series of HTTP or HTTPS packets to an affected controller configured for WebAuth.      This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless   segments. A TCP three-way handshake is needed in order to exploit this   vulnerability.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtt47435](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtt47435) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-0370.      **Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Unauthorized Access Vulnerability** The Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by an unauthorized access vulnerability where an unauthenticated attacker could view and modify the configuration of an affected Cisco WLC.    This vulnerability exists if CPU-based access control lists (ACLs) are configured in the wireless controller. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the controller over TCP port 1023. Only the Cisco 4400 Series WLCs, WiSM version 1, and Cisco Catalyst 3750G Integrated WLCs are affected by this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtu56709](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtu56709) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-0371.  Workarounds  * This Cisco Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities and their respective workarounds are independent of each other.      Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers HTTP Denial of Service Vulnerability   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.      Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers IPv6 Denial of Service Vulnerability   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.      Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers WebAuth Denial of Service Vulnerability   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.      Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Unauthorized Access Vulnerability   CPU based ACLs can be configured to block access to the affected WLC on TCP port 1023. After ACLs are defined, they can be applied to the management interface,   the access point manager (AP-manager) interface, or any of the dynamic   interfaces for client data traffic or to the Network Processing Unit (NPU)   interface for traffic to the controller CPU.      Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory, which is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20120229-wlc>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.  If a given release train is vulnerable, then the earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed in the "First Fixed Release" column of the table. A device running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable.         | **Vulnerability/Bug ID** | **Affected Release** | **First Fixed Release** |   | HTTP DoS Vulnerability (CSCts81997) | 4.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.1 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.1M | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.2 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.2M | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 5.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 5.1 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 5.2 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 6.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 7.0 | 7.0.121.3 (7.0.220.0 CCO) |   | 7.1 | 7.1.90.2  (7.1.91.0 CCO) |   | 7.2 | 7.2.1.57  (7.2.103.0 CCO) |   | IPv6DoS Vulnerability (CSCtt07949) | 4.0 | Not Vulnerable |   | 4.1 | Not Vulnerable |   | 4.1M | Not Vulnerable |   | 4.2 | Not Vulnerable |   | 4.2M | Not Vulnerable |   | 5.0 | Not Vulnerable |   | 5.1 | Not Vulnerable |   | 5.2 | Not Vulnerable |   | 6.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 7.0 | 7.0.121.3  (7.0.220.0 CCO) |   | 7.1 | 7.1.90.2  (7.1.91.0 CCO) |   | 7.2 | 7.2.1.58  (7.2.103.0 CCO) |   | WebAuth DoS Vulnerability (CSCtt47435) | 4.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.1 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.1M | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.2 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.2M | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 5.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 5.1 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 5.2 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 6.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 7.0 | 7.0.121.5  (7.0.220.0 CCO) |   | 7.1 | 7.1.90.5 (7.1.91.0 CCO) |   | 7.2 | Not Vulnerable |   | Unauthorized Access Vulnerability (CSCtu56709) | 4.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.1 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.1M | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.2 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 4.2M | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 5.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 5.1 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 5.2 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 6.0 | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.0 or later |   | 7.0 | 7.0.220.4  (7.0.230.0 CCO) |   | 7.1 | Not Vulnerable |   | 7.2 | Not Vulnerable |        Recommended Releases The "Recommended Release" table lists the releases which have fixes for   all the published vulnerabilities at the time of this Advisory.
