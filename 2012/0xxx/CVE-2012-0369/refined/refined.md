Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-0369:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability caused by sending a series of IPv6 packets to the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing IPv6 packets.
- The affected devices do not properly handle these packets, leading to a device reload.
- Legitimate IPv6 traffic can trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack results in a denial of service, causing the affected WLC to reload, disrupting network services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker sending a series of IPv6 packets.
- The attack can be launched remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need authentication to trigger this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the ability to send IPv6 packets to the vulnerable WLC.
- No special position is required, and the attacker can be remote from the device.

**Additional Details:**
- The IPv6 pass-through feature is not affected by this vulnerability.
- Cisco 4400 Series WLC, Cisco Wireless Services Modules (WiSM), and Cisco Catalyst 3750G Integrated WLCs are not affected by this specific vulnerability.
