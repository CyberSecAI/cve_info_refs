Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Linux kernel's Asynchronous I/O (AIO) subsystem manages `kiocb` (kernel I/O control block) structures when allocated in batches. Specifically, when a batch of `kiocbs` is allocated and one of the initial requests fails, the remaining unused `kiocbs` within the batch were not being properly removed from the active request list (`ctx->active_reqs`) or accounted for in the active request counter (`ctx->reqs_active`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Accounting:** The kernel was not correctly decrementing the count of active requests (`ctx->reqs_active`) when `kiocbs` in a batch failed and were not processed.
- **List Corruption:** The `kiocb_batch_free()` function was freeing `kiocb` structures without removing them from the `ctx->active_reqs` list leading to potential list corruption.
- **Resource Leak:** Unused `kiocbs` would remain in the active list, preventing a process from exiting correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Process Hang:** Processes using AIO could get stuck in a "D" state (uninterruptible sleep) during exit because `ctx->reqs_active` would not reach zero due to incorrectly tracked `kiocbs`, preventing them from terminating properly.
- **Potential Kernel Oops:** The corrupted `active_reqs` list could lead to a kernel panic or "oops" due to memory management issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker could trigger this vulnerability by submitting a batch of AIO requests where one or more initial requests fail, causing the system to enter the described state.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit AIO requests. No special capabilities beyond those required to use the AIO functionality are mentioned in the provided text.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue was introduced in Linux kernel version 3.2-rc1 via commit `080d676de095` ("aio: allocate kiocbs in batches").
- The fix involves modifying the `kiocb_batch_free()` function to remove unused `kiocbs` from the `ctx->active_reqs` list and update the `ctx->reqs_active` counter.
- Commit `69e4747ee9727d660b88d7e1efe0f4afcb35db1b` implemented the fix.
- The fix was backported into the stable kernel as commit `802f43594d6e4d2ac61086d239153c17873a0428` which changes function call to `kiocb_batch_free(struct kioctx *ctx, struct kiocb_batch *batch)` with updated implementation in the commit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG were not affected because they did not backport the vulnerable commit `080d676d`.
- This vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service.
