Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient session management within the commenting and community scripts of Movable Type. Specifically, the session handling allows for hijacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session Hijacking:  The primary vulnerability is the ability for a remote attacker to hijack a user's session.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):  The commenting and community scripts are also vulnerable to CSRF attacks, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary script code on a victim's browser under certain conditions.
-  Additionally, the reports mention other vulnerabilities fixed in the same update, such as OS Command Injection, and XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: Successful session hijacking allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to their account and its associated privileges.
- CSRF:  A successful CSRF attack can result in an attacker executing arbitrary script code within the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to further compromise of the victim's account or other malicious actions.
- Overall, a remote attacker can impersonate a valid user of the affected products.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack:  The attack is launched remotely over the network.
- Unauthenticated: The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
