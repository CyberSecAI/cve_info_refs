  "CVE-2012-0878": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2012-0878",
      "Description": "A security flaw was found in the way Paster, a pluggable command-line frontend, when started as root (for example to have access to privileged port) to serve a web based application, performed privileges dropping upon startup (supplementary groups were not dropped properly regardless of the UID, GID specified in the .ini configuration file or in the --user and --group CL arguments). A remote attacker could use this flaw for example to read / write root GID accessible files, if the particular web application provided remote means for local file manipulation."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The `paster serve` command in python-paste-script did not properly drop supplementary group privileges when started as root.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper privilege dropping",
        "Failure to remove supplementary group memberships"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could potentially read or write files accessible by the root group if the web application provided remote file manipulation capabilities.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Remote exploitation via a web application",
         "Local exploitation if a user can run the python script"
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "Ability to access a web application with file manipulation functionality, started with paster as root.",
        "Alternatively local user access to run the script as root."
      ]
    }
