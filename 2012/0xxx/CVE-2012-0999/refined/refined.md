Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security issues addressed in LEPTON 1.1.4:

**Root cause of vulnerability**: The content indicates multiple vulnerabilities were present in earlier versions of LEPTON, specifically before version 1.1.4. These were identified by the High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab and others. The fixes focus on issues like unchecked post variables, potential for name clashes, and token handling problems.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
*   **Unchecked POST variables**: Some scripts were not properly validating or sanitizing data received through POST requests.
*   **Name clashing**: Variable names starting with `$new_` could clash with other variables.
*   **Invalid tokens**: Issues with token handling caused problems in LEPTON 1.1.3, potentially allowing actions without proper authorization.
*  **Missing default values**: Several scripts were missing default values, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
* **Improper input validation**:  Some fields like "display name" were not properly validating inputs, allowing for whitespace.

**Impact of exploitation**:
*  Unspecified, but the identified issues could potentially lead to unauthorized access or modification of data and system configuration, including possible code injection due to unchecked variables.

**Attack vectors**:
*   **HTTP POST requests**:  Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities through crafted POST requests, targeting scripts not properly handling these variables.
*  **Front-end signup**:  Vulnerabilities were present within the front-end signup process, suggesting potential for malicious account creation.
*  **Admin login**: Issues related to forgotten passwords highlight a potential vector for account takeover if not properly secured.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests**: Attackers need the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the server running LEPTON.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable scripts**: Attackers would need knowledge of the vulnerable scripts to target their attacks.

**Additional notes:**
*   The provided content outlines a major security release that addresses several vulnerabilities, including those reported by High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab.
*   The fixes included not only security issues but also bug fixes and updates to modules like TinyMCE.
*  The fixes touch multiple parts of the CMS, including account management, modules, core framework and admin interfaces.
* The update to TinyMCE 3.4.8 was also a security related update, as detailed by the provided changelog URL.
