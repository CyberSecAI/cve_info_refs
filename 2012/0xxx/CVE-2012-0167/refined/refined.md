    "information": "The provided documents discuss CVE-2012-0167 which is a GDI+ Heap Overflow Vulnerability.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by GDI+ improperly handling the validation of specially crafted EMF images within a Microsoft Office file.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the way that the Office GDI+ library handles validation of specially crafted EMF images embedded within an Office document.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   Opening a specially crafted Office document.\n*   Email attack scenario: An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.\n*   Web-based attack scenario: An attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted Office document that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's website, and then convinced them to open a specially crafted Office document.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   An attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted office document. This could involve using social engineering or malicious links/attachments via email or web pages.\n*   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious office document with the crafted EMF image."
