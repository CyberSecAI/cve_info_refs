| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=787109#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-03 07:28:57 UTC  ``` However upstream PyXML will still be affected  Juraj Somorovsky reported that certain XML parsers/servers are affected by the same, or similar, flaw as the hash table collisions CPU usage denial of service.  Sending a specially crafted message to an XML service can result in longer processing time, which could lead to a denial of service.  It is reported that this attack on XML can be applied on different XML nodes (such as entities, element attributes, namespaces, various elements in the XML security, etc.).  PyXML is written in Python and makes significant use of arrays. It is unclear if fixing the Python array hash DoS bug ([Bz 750555](show_bug.cgi?id=750555 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1150 python: hash table collisions CPU usage DoS (oCERT-2011-003)")) will completely address this issue however at first glance it would appear to be the case. In other words no action should be neccesary from upstream to correct this.  Additionally our PyXML uses the system expat (from the spec file):  # build PyXML with system expat # Make sure we don't use local one  which is covered in bug: 787080   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=787109#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-03 07:31:17 UTC  ``` Packages that require PyXML:  SOAPpy-0.11.6-11 subscription-manager-0.96.12-1   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=787109#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2015-01-17 04:45:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of xerces as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=787104#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-03 07:05:28 UTC  ```  Juraj Somorovsky reported that certain XML parsers/servers are affected by the same, or similar, flaw as the hash table collisions CPU usage denial of service.  Sending a specially crafted message to an XML service can result in longer processing time, which could lead to a denial of service.  It is reported that this attack on XML can be applied on different XML nodes (such as entities, element attributes, namespaces, various elements in the XML security, etc.).  xerces-j2 is written in Java and makes significant use of arrays.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=787104#c7)  Kurt Seifried    2015-01-17 04:45:11 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of xerces as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

Subject: Summer bug cleaning - some Hash DoS stuff

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

So in the spirit of cleaning out the fridge of mystery condiments I'm
going through a bunch of old/lower severity bugs that have been
lurking in our BZ. To start with some Hash DoS related stuff from 2012:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=787103>
CVE-2012-0880 xml: xerces-c hash table collisions CPU usage DoS
(oCERT-2011-003

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=787104>
 CVE-2012-0881 xml: xerces-j2 hash table collisions CPU usage DoS
(oCERT-2011-003)

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=787109>
CVE-2012-0877 PyXML: hash table collisions CPU usage DoS (oCERT-2011-003)

Basically different code bases/etc, but all using poor hash
implementations.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=787109#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-03 07:28:57 UTC  ``` However upstream PyXML will still be affected  Juraj Somorovsky reported that certain XML parsers/servers are affected by the same, or similar, flaw as the hash table collisions CPU usage denial of service.  Sending a specially crafted message to an XML service can result in longer processing time, which could lead to a denial of service.  It is reported that this attack on XML can be applied on different XML nodes (such as entities, element attributes, namespaces, various elements in the XML security, etc.).  PyXML is written in Python and makes significant use of arrays. It is unclear if fixing the Python array hash DoS bug ([Bz 750555](show_bug.cgi?id=750555 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1150 python: hash table collisions CPU usage DoS (oCERT-2011-003)")) will completely address this issue however at first glance it would appear to be the case. In other words no action should be neccesary from upstream to correct this.  Additionally our PyXML uses the system expat (from the spec file):  # build PyXML with system expat # Make sure we don't use local one  which is covered in bug: 787080   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=787109#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-03 07:31:17 UTC  ``` Packages that require PyXML:  SOAPpy-0.11.6-11 subscription-manager-0.96.12-1   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=787109#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2015-01-17 04:45:23 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of xerces as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-08-09 12:23:01 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  However upstream PyXML will still be affected  Juraj Somorovsky reported that certain XML parsers/servers are affected by the same, or similar, flaw as the hash table collisions CPU usage denial of service.  Sending a specially crafted message to an XML service can result in longer processing time, which could lead to a denial of service.  It is reported that this attack on XML can be applied on different XML nodes (such as entities, element attributes, namespaces, various elements in the XML security, etc.).  PyXML is written in Python and makes significant use of arrays. It is unclear if fixing the Python  array hash DoS bug (Bz 750555) will completely address this issue however at first glance it would  appear to be the case. In other words no action should be neccesary from upstream to correct this.  Additionally our PyXML uses the system expat (from the spec file):    @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Ian Delaney (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2014-08-13 02:04:44 UTC  ``` <@maintainer(s): after the bump>  What bump?? The copy pasted paragraph tells us Bz 750555 has already been fixed no less than 2 years ago in Cpython. Then "In other words no action should be neccesary from upstream to correct this".  There is no traceable patch CVE patch.  If one is made feel free to tell us. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-03-19 08:23:25 UTC  ``` No traceable information for this vulnerability.  No other distro has anything either regarding the matter either. ``` |  |
