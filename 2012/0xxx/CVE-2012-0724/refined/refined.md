  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to a flaw in the processing of 'length' properties within SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) filters. This issue can be triggered by a specially crafted SVG file that contains a large 'length' value in a 'feColorMatrix' filter primitive.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation allowing for a large integer value in SVG filters.",
	  "Potential for memory corruption due to incorrect handling of allocated resources."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by exploiting this vulnerability. This could lead to unexpected application termination.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker crafts a malicious SVG file with an abnormally large 'length' property within a feColorMatrix filter. The file is then opened in a vulnerable application."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to deliver the crafted SVG file to a user who will open it with a vulnerable application."
