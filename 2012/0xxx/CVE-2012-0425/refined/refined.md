{
  "CVE-2012-0425": {
    "Description": "LanItems.ycp in save_y2logs in yast2-network before 2.24.4 in SUSE YaST writes cleartext Wi-Fi credentials to the y2log log file, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading the (1) WIRELESS_WPA_PASSWORD or (2) WIRELESS_CLIENT_KEY_PASSWORD field.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `save_y2logs` function in `LanItems.ycp` of the `yast2-network` module writes Wi-Fi credentials in cleartext to the `y2log` log file.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Cleartext storage of sensitive information",
      "Inadequate protection of Wi-Fi passwords"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Context-dependent attackers can gain access to sensitive Wi-Fi credentials by reading the log file. This can lead to unauthorized network access and potential compromise of the network.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Access to the `y2log` log file",
	  "Context-dependent access to the system"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the system's log file (`y2log`) to read the stored credentials. This access could be local or remote, depending on the system setup and logging configuration."
