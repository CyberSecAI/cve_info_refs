Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0862:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `xinetd` handles services configured with `TCPMUX` or `TCPMUXPLUS` types when the `tcpmux-server` service is enabled. Instead of only exposing services specifically configured for TCPMUX, `xinetd` incorrectly exposes all enabled services on port 1, the TCPMUX port.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Service Exposure:** The primary weakness is that `xinetd` exposes services that should not be accessible via the TCPMUX port (port 1). This violates the principle of least privilege.
*   **Firewall Bypass:** Attackers could potentially bypass firewall restrictions that are designed to limit access to specific services on specific ports.
*   **Incorrect Service Handling**: The `tcpmux-server` service does not validate if the requested service is of type `TCPMUX` or `TCPMUXPLUS` before launching it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker can gain access to services that are not intended to be exposed via the TCPMUX port.
*   **Potential System Compromise:** Depending on the exposed services, an attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in those services to gain further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by connecting to the target system's TCPMUX port (port 1).
*   **Service Name Guessing/Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the name of an enabled service on the target system to access it through the TCPMUX port

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to connect to the target system's TCPMUX port (port 1)
*   **Knowledge of Enabled Services:** The attacker needs knowledge (or can guess) a valid service name handled by `xinetd` on the target system.
*   **Enabled tcpmux-server:**  The `tcpmux-server` service must be enabled on the target `xinetd` instance, which is disabled by default.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that only services configured as `TCPMUX` or `TCPMUXPLUS` are exposed via the tcpmux-server.
*   The fix includes sending a "Service name not found" message back to the client if the requested service is not found or is not of type `TCPMUX` or `TCPMUXPLUS`.

**Patch Information:**
The vulnerability was addressed in `xinetd` version 2.3.15, which includes patches to properly validate the service types and prevent the unintended service exposure.

**Red Hat Specific Information:**

*   Red Hat assigned CVE-2012-0862 to this vulnerability.
*   Red Hat released security advisories (RHSA-2013:0499 and RHSA-2013:1302) to address this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
