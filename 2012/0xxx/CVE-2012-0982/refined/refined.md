Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-0982

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `search.php` script of the Vastal I-Tech Agent Zone software. Specifically, the `price_from` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly display the results of the SQL query, making it a blind SQL injection vulnerability. This means the attacker has to infer the output by observing the application's behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
*   The attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   The attacker could potentially gain control over the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is carried out over the web via HTTP requests to the vulnerable `search.php` script.
*   The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `price_from` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials prior to the exploitation.
*   The attacker needs to understand SQL and blind SQL injection techniques to effectively exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The provided example exploits show how to test for the vulnerability:

*   `http://server/real/search.php?price_from=1000000.00+and+1=1&price_to=10000000.00` - This query should return a normal response from the application.
*   `http://server/real/search.php?price_from=1000000.00+and+1=0&price_to=10000000.00` - This query should result in a different application behavior or no results if the injection is successful.
*   `http://server/real/search.php?price_from=1000000.00[BlindSQLI]&price_to=10000000.00` - This illustrates the location where the blind SQL injection payload should be inserted.

The exploit example demonstrates how to test for the vulnerability, confirming that the `price_from` parameter is not sanitized and is directly used within the SQL query.
