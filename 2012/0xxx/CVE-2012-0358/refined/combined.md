| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.7 |

## Cisco AnyConnect Clientless SSL VPN Portforwarder ActiveX control buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#339177

Original Release Date: 2012-03-14 | Last Revised: 2014-07-24

---

### Overview

The Cisco AnyConnect ActiveX control contains a buffer overflow vulnerability, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Cisco AnyConnect is an SSL VPN solution that is commonly initiated through use of a web browser. When Internet Explorer is used, the AnyConnect VPN server provides an ActiveX control that downloads and installs the AnyConnect client software. One of the components provided by Cisco AnyConnect for use with Internet Explorer is an ActiveX control called the "CISCO Portforwarder Control." This ActiveX control is provided by the file ciscopf.ocx. The Cisco Portforwarder ActiveX control contains a buffer overflow in its initialization parameters. We have confirmed that version 1.0.1.8 of the Portforwarder control is vulnerable. Previous versions may also be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in Cisco Security Advisory [cisco-sa-20120314-asaclient](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120314-asaclient). Please note that updating a Cisco ASA device with the fixed software will not protect systems that have already downloaded the vulnerable control. Please also consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Disable the Cisco AnyConnect Portforwarder ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable Cisco AnyConnect Portforwarder ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400 |

Microsoft Windows-based systems that are running Internet Explorer or another browser that supports Microsoft ActiveX technology may be affected if the system has ever connected to a device that is running the Cisco Clientless VPN solution. A remote, unauthenticated attacker who could convince a user to connect to a malicious web page could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine with the privileges of the web browser.  Affected Products  * Cisco Clientless VPN is a feature available on Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.   Vulnerable ProductsCisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances that are running one of the following versions contain the affected ActiveX component:    | **Affected Version** | **Affected Release** |   | Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software 7.x | 7.1 7.2 |   | Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software 8.x | 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.6 |         **Note:** Cisco ASA Software version 7.0 and 7.1 have reached end of software maintenance. Customers who are using Cisco ASA Software version 7.0 or 7.1 should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco ASA Software.      **Note:** The affected implementation of the Cisco Clientless VPN solution was introduced with the release of Cisco ASA Software version 7.1. This issue does not affect devices running Cisco PIX Software.    Administrators may determine whether the Cisco Clientless VPN solution is enabled on their devices by issuing the **show running-config webvpn** command. The following example shows the response when the Cisco Clientless VPN solution is enabled: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn   webvpn enable outside   ``` End user systems running Microsoft Windows may be affected if they have used the Cisco Clientless VPN feature on an affected device from a browser that supports ActiveX technology. Devices that contain the ***cscopf.ocx*** ActiveX control registered with a class ID (CLSID) of **{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}** are affected. The affected controls are marked both Safe for Scripting (SFS) and Safe for Initialization (SFI), which may present additional attack vectors when a system has registered and cached the affected control.Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable   + Cisco Firewall Service Modules are not affected by this vulnerability   + Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Services Modules are not affected by this vulnerability   + Cisco IOS Software-based devices that use the Cisco Clientless VPN solution (WebVPN) are not affected by this vulnerability   No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) contain a feature known as the Cisco Clientless VPN solution. The Cisco Clientless VPN feature allows users to use a web browser to create an SSL VPN tunnel from an endpoint device to a Cisco ASA device. When connected, the ASA pushes several ActiveX and Java applications to the endpoint device to allow a number of features to operate.      When a browser that supports Microsoft ActiveX technology is used to create the Clientless VPN tunnel, the Cisco Port Forwarder ActiveX control may be sent to the endpoint system on which the browser is running. This control contains an exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker who can convince a user to visit a malicious website to execute attacker-controlled arbitrary code on the endpoint device. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with the privileges of the user who invoked the browser used to visit the attacker-controlled website. If the user has administrative privileges, a complete compromise may occur.      Upgrading a Cisco ASA device to a version of software that contains the fixed control will not remediate the issue on endpoint systems that have downloaded the affected control. Affected endpoint systems will need to disable the control via one of the methods suggested in the "Workarounds" section of this document. Endpoint systems may also connect to a Cisco ASA device that is running a version of software that contains the fixed control via the Cisco Clientless VPN solution to update the control to an unaffected version.      When loaded on an endpoint system, the affected control has a binary name of *cscopf.ocx* and is registered on a system with a CLSID of **{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}**. Fixed versions of the *cscopf.ocx* control are registered with CLSID **{C861B75F-EE32-4aa4-B610-281AF26A8D1C}**.      Microsoft has set the global kill bit for the affected control at the request of Cisco. The Microsoft update that included this kill-bit is detailed in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2695962, and was released May 8th, 2012. The Microsoft Security Advisory may be found at the following link: [Microsoft Security Advisory (2695962) Update Rollup for ActiveX Kill Bits](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2695962)      Once this update has been applied, either via Auto-Update or manually, the affected control will stop operating on affected endpoints that have applied the update.      This advisory addresses the vulnerability in the Cisco Port Forwarder ActiveX control provided by Cisco ASA when the Cisco Clientless VPN feature is used. This issue is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtr00165](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr00165) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-0358.  Workarounds  * End users or administrators may mitigate Internet Explorer as an attack vector by setting the kill bit for the affected ActiveX control. This can be achieved by modifying the registry either directly on the affected machine or via an Active Directory Group Policy.  **Warning:** Incorrectly modifying the system registry of a Microsoft Windows-based device may cause serious problems. Neither Cisco nor Microsoft can guarantee that you can resolve problems that may result from improper registry modification from either applying the registry changes via a .*reg* file or by using the Registry Editor incorrectly. Modify the registry of your system at your own risk.  To set the kill bit for the CLSID with a value of **{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}**, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Save the file using the *.reg* filename extension.  ```   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}]   "Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400      [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}]   "Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400      ```  End users can apply this *.reg* file to individual systems by double-clicking the file. Administrators can also apply the registry change across domains by using Group Policy. You can find more information about using Group Policy in the following Microsoft TechNet article: [Group Policy Collection](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=215719 "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=215719")  When the registry change has been applied, Microsoft Internet Explorer must be restarted for the changes to take effect. Once the kill bit has been set, the affected control will no longer be accessible by the Cisco Clientless VPN system or a malicious web page when accessed by Internet Explorer. This change may impact some clientless installations that use the Cisco Port Forwarder ActiveX control. One common component that may stop operating is the ActiveX RDP plug-in.    Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in a network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20120314-asaclient>      **Note:** When the updated ActiveX Control or the Microsoft Kill Bit update is applied to an endpoint device, the kill bit value in the registry will be changed to 0x00000400 from 0x04000400 if the above workaround has been applied. This change still effectively blocks the execution of the affected ActiveX control. The above registry change also sets the binary behaviors kill bit as well as the ActiveX kill bit. The binary behaviors kill bit is supported on Windows Server 2003 and above, and potentially provides additional protections. Platforms that do not support the binary behaviors kill bit will ignore this setting and only utilize the ActiveX portion of the bit-mask.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.    | **Affected Version** | **First Fixed Release** | **Recommended Release** |   | Cisco ASA 7.0 | Not Vulnerable | Migrate to 7.2 or later |   | Cisco ASA 7.1 | Vulnerable | Vulnerable; Migrate to 7.2 or later |   | Cisco ASA 7.2 | 7.2(5.6) | 7.2(5.7) |   | Cisco ASA 8.0 | 8.0(5.26) | Migrate to 8.2(5.26) or later |   | Cisco ASA 8.1 | 8.1(2.53) | Migrate to 8.2(5.26) or later |   | Cisco ASA 8.2 | 8.2(5.18) | 8.2(5.26) |   | Cisco ASA 8.3 | 8.3(2.28) | Migrate to 8.4(3.8) or later |   | Cisco ASA 8.4 | 8.4(2.16) | 8.4(3.8) |   |   | Cisco ASA 8.5 | Not Vulnerable | 8.5(1.7) |   | Cisco ASA 8.6 | 8.6(1.1) | 8.6(1.1) |       **Note:** Cisco ASA Software version 7.0 and 7.1 have reached end of software maintenance. Customers who are using Cisco ASA Software version 7.0 or 7.1 should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco ASA Software.  **Note:** The recommended releases contain the fixes for all vulnerabilities for all the advisories published in the publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release that is equal to or later than these recommended releases.**Note:** Upgrading a Cisco ASA device to a version of software that contains the fixed version of the Cisco Port Forwarder ActiveX control does not remove the vulnerability on affected endpoint systems. Affected endpoint systems will need to download the fixed version by connecting to a Cisco ASA device that is running fixed software via the Cisco Clientless Web solution or disable the affected control via one of the methods mentioned in the "Workarounds" section of this document.
