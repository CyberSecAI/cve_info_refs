Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the Cisco Port Forwarder ActiveX control (`ciscopf.ocx`) used by the Cisco Clientless VPN solution. This control is pushed to client systems when users connect to a Cisco ASA device via a web browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow within the ActiveX control's initialization parameters.
- **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution:** This overflow can be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
- **ActiveX Control Issues:** The affected control is marked as both Safe for Scripting (SFS) and Safe for Initialization (SFI), potentially increasing attack vectors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker's code executes with the privileges of the user running the web browser. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can completely compromise the system.
- **Complete System Compromise:** With administrative privileges, an attacker could potentially take full control of the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email) that triggers the vulnerability when viewed in a browser.
- **Clientless VPN Connection:** Users connecting to a vulnerable Cisco ASA device using a browser that supports ActiveX may inadvertently download the vulnerable control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to the vulnerable system. They can initiate the attack remotely.
- **Ability to Lure Victim:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious web page or connect to the malicious Cisco ASA device.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable ActiveX control is identified by the CLSID `{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}` and the binary name `cscopf.ocx`.
- Fixed versions of the control have a CLSID of `{C861B75F-EE32-4aa4-B610-281AF26A8D1C}`.
- Microsoft released a kill-bit update on May 8th, 2012 (Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2695962) that disables the vulnerable control.
- Cisco also released updated versions of Cisco ASA Software that contain the fixed control.
