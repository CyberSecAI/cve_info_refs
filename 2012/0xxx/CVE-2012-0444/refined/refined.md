  "cve": "CVE-2012-0444",
  "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Ogg Vorbis parser used by Mozilla products like Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey. Specifically, missing input sanitization in the parser can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution. This is due to an overflow in the `info->postlist` array inside the function `floor1_unpack` when handling malformed Ogg Vorbis files.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Mozilla Firefox",
    "Mozilla Thunderbird",
    "Mozilla SeaMonkey",
    "Iceape",
     "Icedove",
     "Mozilla XULrunner",
     "libvorbis"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Missing input sanitization in the Ogg Vorbis parser.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to an out-of-bounds write.",
      "Lack of validation of user-influenced data leading to the overflow of the `info->postlist` array."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a denial of service (application crash) and potentially allow for remote code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": "Exploitation occurs when a user opens a specially crafted Ogg Vorbis file with a vulnerable application." ,
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious Ogg Vorbis file that triggers the overflow. This file could be delivered through a website, email, or any other means that allows users to open it with the vulnerable application."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "developer_fixes": "The fix involves adding a validation check to ensure the number of values read for the postlist does not exceed the array's bounds. The fix was applied to the `libvorbis/lib/vorbis_floor1.c` file in the function `floor1_unpack`.",
    "affected_versions": "Multiple versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey were affected, including those based on the 1.9.2 code base.",
     "mitigation": "Users should update their browsers and other affected applications to the patched versions to mitigate the vulnerability."
