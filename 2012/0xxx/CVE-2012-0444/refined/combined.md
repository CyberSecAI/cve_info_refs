| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla Firefox
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2012:0221-1
Rating: important
References: #744275
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 SP4
SLE SDK 10 SP4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to 3.6.26 fixing bugs and
security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed by this
update:
\*
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
\*
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported
memory safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10
and Firefox 3.6.26.
\*
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons
Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web
addresses containing square brackets around the host. If
this host was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox
attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain name.
Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6
syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may
generate errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6.
The resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0,
Thunderbird 7.0, and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in
Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
\*
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
that removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed
under certain circumstances because of a premature
notification of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free
of the child nodes could possibly allow for for remote code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
the possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of
Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding
and has the potential for remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers
Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that
when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet,
Firefox can crash due to a memory corruption. While there
is no evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is
a possibility of remote code execution.
Indications:
Please install this update.
Special Instructions and Notes:
Please reboot the system after installing this update.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla XULrunner
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2012:0198-1
Rating: important
References: #737533 #744275
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 11 SP1
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 for VMware
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes one version update.
Description:
Mozilla XULrunner was updated to 1.9.2.26 security update,
fixing security issues and bugs. The following security
bugs have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
\*
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported
memory safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10
and Firefox 3.6.26.
\*
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons
Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web
addresses containing square brackets around the host. If
this host was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox
attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain name.
Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6
syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may
generate errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6.
The resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0,
Thunderbird 7.0, and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in
Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
\*
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
that removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed
under certain circumstances because of a premature
notification of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free
of the child nodes could possibly allow for for remote code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
the possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of
Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding
and has the potential for remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers
Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that
when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet,
Firefox can crash due to a memory corruption. While there
is no evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is
a possibility of remote code execution.
Indications:

# USN-1370-1: libvorbis vulnerability

20 February 2012

libvorbis could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [libvorbis](/security/cves?package=libvorbis) - The Vorbis General Audio Compression Codec

## Details

It was discovered that libvorbis did not correctly handle certain malformed

ogg files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted ogg file

with an application that uses libvorbis, an attacker could cause a denial

of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [libvorbis0a](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libvorbis)
  -
  [1.3.2-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libvorbis/1.3.2-1ubuntu2.1)

  -
  [1.2.3-3ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libvorbis/1.2.3-3ubuntu1.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

ZDI-CAN-1477: Mozilla Firefox Ogg Vorbis Decoding Memory Corruption
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- CVSS -----------------------------------------
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P
-- ABSTRACT -------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following
products:
Mozilla Firefox
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS ------------------------
Memory corruption is possible when Firefox is parsing Ogg Vorbis
files. The vulnerability is inside the function static
vorbis\_info\_floor \*floor1\_unpack (vorbis\_info \*vi,oggpack\_buffer
\*opb), in the file
libvorbis/lib/vorbis\_floor1.c:
--- code snip begin ---
...
for(j=0,k=0;j<info->partitions;j++){
count+=info->class\_dim[info->partitionclass[j]];
for(;k<count;k++){
int t=info->postlist[k+2]=oggpack\_read(opb,rangebits);
if(t<0 || t>=(1<<rangebits))
goto err\_out;
}
}
...
--- code snip end ---
The loop populates the info->postlist array and can be overflowed. The
values which determine the amount to copy are user influenced. The
info->class\_dim array is populated with user data, with each element
value being between 1 and 8. The info->partitions value is also taken
from userdata, and can be between 0 and 31. Thus, the total sub-loop
iterations can be 8\*31, or 248. Each iteration of the subloop copies
one element (int) into info->postlist, a fixed-size buffer which is
only sized to 65 elements (int). This results in memory corruption and
can be exploited to gain remote code execution.

This is a simple fix, which errors out if the number of values to be read is larger than the array. I'm not confident this is the correct fix, because rangebits can be as large as 15, leaving far more than 63 legal values for the postlist, and I don't see where in the spec a smaller limit is imposed. Waiting for confirmation from Monty.

Your conclusion/suggested fix is correct.
What the spec is supposed to say is that there are a maximum number of 65 postlist entries; entry 0 is implicit and set to 0, entry 1 is set to 1<<rangebits, and then up to a maximum of 63 more entries are read in that loop. The code is supposed to enforce that.
Neither limit is there; the spec is silent and the code does not check. I'm patching upstream spec and code now.

Proposed fix
[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by (bug #): not a regression
User impact if declined: potential arbitrary code execution
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): landed on inbound, passes media tests locally
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): very low, may reject some invalid Vorbis files that were previously accepted (if it didn't trash enough memory to cause a crash)

I don't think there's any reason to wait. Though it wasn't clear to me from the above report if this sample contained an actual exploit or just caused a crash (it didn't actually crash my Linux build, though most likely through dumb luck), you \_may\_ wish to use a different example that just triggers the out-of-bounds write, and doesn't attempt arbitrary code execution.

For completeness, note that the patch landed here differs in one aspect--the patch hunks that applied to libtremor have been removed because libtremor is not present in 1.9.2. In all other aspects, the patch is identical to that landed on the other trees.

Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3670 CVE-2012-0442 CVE-2012-0444 CVE-2012-0449

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, Debian's
variant of the Mozilla Thunderbird code base.

CVE-2011-3670
	Icedove does not not properly enforce the IPv6 literal address
	syntax, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
	information by making XMLHttpRequest calls through a proxy and
	reading the error messages.

CVE-2012-0442
	Memory corruption bugs could cause Icedove to crash or
  	possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-0444
	Icedove does not properly initialize nsChildView data
	structures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
	service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly
	execute arbitrary code via a crafted Ogg Vorbis file.

CVE-2012-0449
	Icedove allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
	(memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via a malformed XSLT stylesheet that is
	embedded in a document

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze7.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

openSUSE Security Update: MozillaFirefox: Version 10
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2012:0234-1
Rating: important
References: #744275
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes 5 new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 10 to fix bugs and
security issues.
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in
the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is
disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or
browser-like contexts in those products. References
CVE-2012-0443: Ben Hawkes, Christian Holler, Honza Bombas,
Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, Jan Odvarko, Peter Van Der
Beken, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety problems
that were fixed in Firefox 10.
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported memory
safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10 and
Firefox 3.6.26.
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons Firefox
has been generous in its interpretation of web addresses
containing square brackets around the host. If this host
was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox attempted to
interpret the host as a regular domain name. Gregory
Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6 syntax
using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate
errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The
resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0, Thunderbird 7.0,
and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in Firefox 3.6.26 and
Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
MFSA 2012-03/CVE-2012-0445: Alex Dvorov reported that an
attacker could replace a sub-frame in another domain's
document by using the name attribute of the sub-frame as a
form submission target. This can potentially allow for
phishing attacks against users and violates the HTML5 frame
navigation policy.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher regenrecht
reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that
removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed under
certain circumstances because of a premature notification
of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free of the child
nodes could possibly allow for for remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-05/CVE-2012-0446: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that frame scripts bypass XPConnect
security checks when calling untrusted objects. This allows
for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages
and Firefox extensions. The fix enables the Script Security
Manager (SSM) to force security checks on all frame scripts.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-06/CVE-2012-0447: Mozilla developer Tim Abraldes
reported that when encoding images as
image/vnd.microsoft.icon the resulting data was always a
fixed size, with uninitialized memory appended as padding
beyond the size of the actual image. This is the result of
mImageBufferSize in the encoder being initialized with a
value different than the size of the source image. There is
the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized memory
being appended to a PNG image when converted fron an ICO
format image. This sensitive data may then be disclosed in
the resulting image.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher regenrecht
reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative the
possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of Ogg
Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding and
has the potential for remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers Nicolas
Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that when
processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet, Firefox
can crash due to a memory corruption. While there is no
evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is a
possibility of remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-09/CVE-2012-0450: magicant starmen reported that
if a user chooses to export their Firefox Sync key the
"Firefox Recovery Key.html" file is saved with incorrect
permissions, making the file contents potentially readable
by other users on Linux and OS X systems.
Firefox 3.6 is not affected by this vulnerability.

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
