{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by multiple scripts in SugarCRM CE using the `unserialize()` function with user-controlled input without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of `unserialize()` with user-controlled data",
       "Lack of input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code by providing a crafted serialized object through a vulnerable input variable (e.g., `$_REQUEST['current_query_by_page']`).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST requests with a malicious serialized PHP object in base64 encoded format within the `current_query_by_page` parameter, or others like `query`, `firstrow`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request containing a base64 encoded serialized PHP object to the vulnerable endpoints. Authentication is required.",
    "more_details": "The vulnerability is present in multiple locations across SugarCRM CE <= 6.3.1, specifically:\n\n*   `include/export_utils.php`\n*   `include/generic/Save2.php`\n*   `include/MVC/Controller/SugarController.php`\n*  `include/MVC/View/views/view.list.php`\n*   `modules/Import/Importer.php`\n*   `modules/ProjectTask/views/view.list.php`\n\nThe exploit utilizes the `__destruct()` method of the `SugarTheme` class by passing a malicious serialized object to gain arbitrary code execution.\n\nDetailed proof of concept code is publicly available at Exploit-DB: <http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/19381/>. The provided exploit shows how to authenticate and then send the malicious serialized object."
