Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-0260:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how ImageMagick decodes certain JPEG images. Specifically, it involves the processing of specially-crafted sequences of RST0 through RST7 restart markers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary weakness is the potential for a denial-of-service attack due to excessive CPU and memory consumption when processing the malicious JPEG images.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service:** By crafting a JPEG image with malicious RST markers, an attacker can cause ImageMagick to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive resources, making it unresponsive. This can lead to a DoS, preventing users from using the software.
- **Potential code execution:** Although not explicitly detailed, the Debian Security Advisory mentions that Integer overflows and missing input validations could result in the execution of arbitrary code, this is not directly stated for CVE-2012-0260 but other CVEs related to imagemagick were mentioned.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote attacker:** A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted JPEG image via web upload, email attachment or other means where the ImageMagick software processes the image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image file for processing by ImageMagick. No specific user privileges are required, since this is a flaw within the software itself.

**Additional details from the content:**
-  The vulnerability was discovered by Aleksis Kauppinen, Joonas Kuorilehto, and Tuomas Parttimaa of Codenomicon's CROSS project, and reported by CERT-FI.
- Patches were made available for multiple affected products and operating systems (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, openSUSE, Ubuntu, etc.)

**Summary of vulnerabilities addressed in ImageMagick updates:**
Several sources reference multiple vulnerabilities being addressed in the same update as CVE-2012-0260:
  - **CVE-2012-0247 and CVE-2012-0248**: Flaws in how ImageMagick handles malformed Exif metadata that could cause a crash, potential code execution or an infinite loop.
  - **CVE-2010-4167:** ImageMagick utilities loading configuration files from the current working directory, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.
  - **CVE-2012-0259:** Integer overflow flaw when processing certain Exif tags with a large components count, causing ImageMagick to access invalid memory.
  - **CVE-2012-1798**: Out-of-bounds buffer read by copying image bytes for TIFF images with crafted TIFF EXIF IFD value
  - **CVE-2012-1185 and CVE-2012-1186** Several integer overflows and missing input validations
- These are not specifically related to the processing of the JPEG files and the CVE-2012-0260, but are good to note for ImageMagick vulnerabilities during this time.

Therefore, the vulnerability of CVE-2012-0260 stems from the lack of input validation when decoding specially crafted JPEG images, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service. The attacker only needs to supply the malicious image for ImageMagick to process.
