Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A boundary error exists within the `receive_packet()` function in `libusbmuxd/libusbmuxd.c`.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a property list that contains an overly long "SerialNumber" field from a USB device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the vulnerable system, under the context of the 'usbmux' user.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also be exploited to crash the usbmuxd service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical access:** The attacker needs physical access to the target system to connect a malicious USB device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to connect a malicious USB device to the target system.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in `usbmuxd` version 1.0.7 and earlier.
- Patches have been released by several Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Mageia, Gentoo).
- A fix has been committed to the usbmuxd GIT repository.
- The vulnerability is present in the `libusbmuxd` library.
