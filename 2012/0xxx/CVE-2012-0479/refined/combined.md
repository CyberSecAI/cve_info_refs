| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912
Steps to reproduce:
I created a test phishing page. At the bottom of it, I put a small piece of JavaScript that redirects to an HTTPS Twitter API page that replies with an HTTP error code and XML content. I then opened the test phishing page in Firefox.
(The exact HTTP error code does not seem to matter; it works at least with 404 and 500. On the other hand, the XML content in the HTTP error body seems to be necessary.)
Actual results:
The certificate of the HTTPS error page is now shown on my phishing page.
Expected results:
The error from Twitter should be displayed and the address in the address bar should indicate the address of the error page.

Summary: Certificates can be stolen from other sites by triggering HTTP errors over HTTPS → Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an HTTP error (e.g. 404) and an XML response body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content

Given location.href='<https://example.org/http404error.xml>'
where http404error.xml is an XML document served with an HTTP 404 response code.
\* Internet Explorer will show its 404 error page.
\* Chrome will display the source of the XML document.
\* Firefox won't load the XML document, and stays on the current page, but it changes the site identity block to be the one for "<https://example.org>".
It seems like we start updating the site identity block while we are loading the target of a navigation, but before we are committed to doing that navigation. That seems wrong to me. We should update the site identity block when we actually navigate away from the current page and when we actually navigate \*to\* the target page. It seems like we update the address in the address bar correctly in this case; perhaps we "just" need to change things so that the site identity block gets updated (only) at the same time the address bar does. (This makes sense, because the site identity block is part of the address bar, as far as users can see.)

Just a quick note: the bug also occurs if the user performs the redirect manually by entering <https://example.org/http404error.xml> in the address bar (instead of by JavaScript as in the phishing example).

Yes. For example, try pasting <https://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline.atom?screen_name=TriggerHTTPError> into the address bar when on this bug's page. The site identity block will change to match the URL but the browser remains on this page. See the screenshot I am about to attach.

Gavin, is this specific to the https page involved having the "application/atom+xml" type (and empty data), or will any type we don't handle internally do?

I'm guessing the latter, actually, and in particular that we have to hit the block at <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/964b118ac852/uriloader/base/nsURILoader.cpp#l528>
If that happens, we in fact leave the old page in place; we shouldn't be sending onSecurityChange in that situation.

| --- | --- | --- |
| [Comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631#c15)• 13 years ago |
|  | |

Short answer is "because nsSecureBrowserIUImpl previously received a STATE\_TRANSFERRING & STATE\_IS\_REQUEST notification for that request" (i.e. it was inserted into mTransferringRequests, which means requestHasTransferedData is set to true when STATE\_STOP & STATE\_IS\_REQUEST is fired for that request).

[Proof of concept v2](attachment.cgi?id=590843)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=590843&action=edit)

I think you're looking at the wrong piece of code. I did some further research and discovered that if a generic XML mime type is used in the response header, the page loading is correctly aborted. So the code referenced by [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631#c12 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content") seems to be secure.
The bug appears to be specific to the Atom and RSS mime types. It should be noted that Twitter gives an XML response that is well-formed XML but not a feed, while it does use a feed mime type. My theory would be that the Atom/RSS handler fails in an insecure way, because the feed is invalid. The HTTP response code might have nothing to do with this bug after all.

OK, if this is specific to the Atom and RSS mime types things make more sense.
So what's happening is that we're landing in the URILoader but the feed sniffer has already sniffed the type to application/vnd.mozilla.maybe.feed. We look for a stream converter from that type to \*/\* and find a JS-implemented converter; I believe this is FeedConverter.js. We start an async convert, call onStartRequest on the converter and return from our original OnStartRequest. The feed converter "converts" the load to a load woth an Atom type. We try to go back through URILoader dispatch for this, but we still have no way to handle it, so we go to hand it off to a helper app. But before doing that we check for an error page, and if we have one bail out.
Now the key part for this last bit is that we \_do\_ have an error page in this case, and by the time we bail out this is the post-converter dispatch running, so we have in fact transferred data.
The fact that the data is not actually a feed \_may\_ have to do with the fact that we don't find a handler for the feed type. Maybe.
In any case, the upshot is that data has been transferred but NOT rendered anywhere. But the secure browser UI just triggers off of data transfer...
We may be able to fix the feed code to bail out earlier (from the initial onStartRequest) if it's not actually the data content that's a problem. But we should try to fix the UI bit as well.

I don't fully understand how this code works. Can you point me to the relevant AsyncConvertData call that invokes the feed converter in this scenario?
Do you want to be checking requestSucceeded before calling getResponseHeader (which potentially throws)?

This is also interesting:
1. Visit a non-HTTPS website
2. Enter <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=614200> in the address bar
Contrary to the Twitter API, I get a download dialog. However, after I cancel that dialog, the site identity button is still spoofed.
My hypothesis:
\* An invalid feed shows a download dialog and spoofs the site identity button.
\* If, additionally, the HTTP status code indicates an error, this download dialog is suppressed.

Yes. Basically, the secure browser UI assumes that data read from the network means data rendered, which is just a broken assumption. In my humble opinion.
I guess I should file a followup bug on that....

Feed converter should check HTTP channel response status before proceeding.
[Approval Request Comment]
Regression caused by (bug #): None
User impact if declined: Possible to spoof some random attack page as Twitter and
possibly other sites via the security UI.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Fixes the testcase in this bug
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low risk: should only
affect behavior when loading an HTTP error page with a feed MIME type.
String changes made by this patch: None.

I presume the patch in [comment 34](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631#c34 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content") does not solve the new test case in [comment 30](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631#c30 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content")? If I'm correct, this patch would still allow spoofing in certain cases (although a strange download dialog would show up).

The steps to reproduce are the same as in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content") / [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content"), but you now paste the URL of the Bugzilla attachment to steal Buzilla's identity instead of a Twitter URL to steal Twitter's identity. Hope that makes it more clear.

The steps were plenty clear. But in today's nightly when I follow them I see the bugzilla URI in the url bar, but the security stuff all still refers to the site that's actually loaded, as expected.

I see the the security info show the information for the currently displayed page, except that it makes it look like it uses SSL, when it actually doesn't (e.g. gavinsharp.com, which doesn't support SSL, shows <http://cl.ly/1W1T1i441i2O141o1916>).

(In reply to Gavin Sharp (use gavin@gavinsharp.com for email) from [comment #39](/show_bug.cgi?id=714631#c39 "VERIFIED FIXED - Redirect to an HTTPS resource that returns an Atom/RSS content type with an invalid body causes the site identity block to show the resource's identity for the source's content"))
That's the same as in the Twitter case. The domain name is correct but the rest of the site identity button is wrong. If Bugzilla would use Extended Validation, you would see 'Mozilla Corporation' in the button and 'connected to gavinsharp.com, run by Mozilla Corporation' in the drop-down window. (See also right picture in [attachment 585286](/attachment.cgi?id=585286 "Screenshots from the proof of concept") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=585286&action=edit "Screenshots from the proof of concept"), it says the domain is localhost.)
Extended Validation is what makes this bug dangerous. Without Extended Validation, you could only spoof a secure connection for your own domain. With Extended Validation, the name of the target company is shown instead of your own domain name.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-33

## Potential site identity spoofing when loading RSS and Atom feeds

Announced
April 24, 2012
Reporter
Jeroen van der Gun
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 12
* Firefox ESR 10.0.4
* SeaMonkey 2.9
* Thunderbird 12
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.4

### Description

Security researcher **Jeroen van der Gun** reported that if RSS
or Atom XML invalid content is loaded over HTTPS, the addressbar updates to
display the new location of the loaded resource, including SSL indicators, while
the main window still displays the previously loaded content. This allows for
phishing attacks where a malicious page can spoof the identify of another
seemingly secure site.

   Korean and Chinese character sets may lead to cross-site scripting.

CVE-2012-0479

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
