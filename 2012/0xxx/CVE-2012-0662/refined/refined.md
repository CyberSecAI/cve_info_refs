- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow existed in the Security framework. Processing untrusted input with the Security framework could result in memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker may cause an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Processing untrusted input with the Security framework.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide untrusted input to the Security framework. The vulnerability does not affect 32-bit processes.
