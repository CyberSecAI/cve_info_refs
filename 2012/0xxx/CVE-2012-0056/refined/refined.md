{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient permission checks in the Linux kernel's handling of /proc/<pid>/mem writes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
	  "Inadequate permission checks"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation, allowing an unprivileged user to gain root access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have a user account on the system.",
	"additional_information": "The vulnerability exists due to a reintroduced function 'mem_write()' in the kernel which does not have proper permission checks. The vulnerability was introduced by upstream git commit 198214a7, which re-enabled the mem_write() function due to changes that were supposed to make it safe, but the permissions checking was done poorly. The vulnerability affects all Linux kernels >=2.6.39 up until the fix commit e268337dfe26dfc7efd422a804dbb27977a3cccc. Attackers can exploit this by opening the fd, using dup2 to redirect the stderr to the file descriptor for writing, and then executing the shellcode in a suid process. Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) has to be disabled, but only for the .text section of suid programs."
