Prevent symlink attacks via .augnew during saving

```
Instead of saving into a predictable PATH.augnew file, save into a securely
created PATH.augnew.XXXXXX

* src/transform.c (transform_save):
    write changes to a temporary file in the same directory as the destination
    (either the file's canonical path or the path of .augnew), before renaming

* src/transform.c (transfer_file_attrs):
    use fchown, fchmod etc. on the same file handles to ensure consistent
    permission changes

* bootstrap: add mkstemp gnulib module
* tests/
    test-put-symlink-augnew.sh: test symlink attack when writing .augnew
    test-put-symlink-augsave.sh: test symlink attack when writing .augsave
    test-put-symlink-augtemp.sh: test symlink attack via temp .augnew
    test-put-symlink.sh: also test file modification

Fixes BZ 772257

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=772261#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-06 16:04:54 UTC  ``` Augeas is a configuration management API that represents the contents of config files as a tree in memory for editing, with the edits being written back to the actual file. By default it loads files it understands in a large number of standard system locations (/etc, /boot), but can also open files in a user specified location [1],[2].  It has two save modes of interest, "backup" that keeps the original in PATH.augorig and "newfile" that leaves the file alone, but writes the edited version to PATH.augnew. These can be set via the API [3] or --backup/--new with augtool (CLI tool around the API).  A flaw was found in the current 0.10.0 version and most previous versions.  It requires that the directory containing the file to be edited is writable by another user, so this needs the user to explicitly open a file in another location or for a file in a default location to be in a group/world writable directory.  This attack hinges on behaviour to support writing to a bind mount (ticket #32 gives some history [4] relating to oVirt?) when doing the rename fails with EBUSY or EXDEV. Augeas instead opens the file and writes straight into it, see transform.c in clone_file when copy_if_rename_fails is set from transform_save.  In two of the three, copy_if_rename_fails is only set if the node /augeas/save/copy_if_rename_fails is created by the user to enable the behaviour [4]. I think there are three ways to exploit this code.  1) with --backup  When creating PATH.augsave, copy_if_rename_fails is always set to 1. A bind mount of a single file (or FUSE, enabling non-privileged attacks?) at PATH.augsave would cause the file contents to be written to the bind mounted file.  2) with --new and /augeas/save/copy_if_rename_fails  As above, but create bind mount at PATH.augnew.  3) with --backup and /augeas/save/copy_if_rename_fails  Augeas first moves PATH to PATH.augsave for the backup, then renames PATH.augnew to PATH. There's a tiny window in which a bind mount could be created at PATH, so the file contents are written to the bind mounted file.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## 1.8.1 - 2017-08-17

> * General changes/addition
>   + Fix error in handling escaped whitespace at the end of path expressions
>     (addresses CVE-2017-7555)

## 1.8.0 - 2017-03-20

> * General changes/additions
>   + augtool: add a 'source' command exposing the aug\_source API call
>   + augtool: add a 'context' command to make changing into a node more
>     discoverable
>   + augtool: add an 'info' command to print important information
>   + augtool: dramatically reduce memory consumption when all lenses are
>     loaded by more aggressively releasing temporary data structures. On
>     my machine, maximum memory usage of 'augtool -L' drops from roughly
>     90MB to about 20MB. This will not change the amount of memory used
>     when only specific lenses are used, only the default behavior of
>     loading all lenses, i.e., when -A is not passed.
>   + make building augtool statically possible (J�rg Krause)
>   + split aug\_to\_xml into its own source file, so that statically linking
>     against libaugeas.a doesn't require also linking against libXml2 and
>     its dependencies, provided aug\_to\_xml is not needed.
> * API changes
>   + add aug\_source to find the source file for a particular node
>   + reduce memory consumption when AUG\_NO\_MODL\_AUTOLOAD is \_not\_ passed;
>     exact same details as described above for augtool
> * Lens changes/additions
>   + Chrony: allow floating point numbers (Miroslav Lichvar)
>     add new directives from chrony 3.0 and 3.1 (Miroslav Lichvar)
>   + Krb5: support include/includedir directives (Jason Smith) (Issue #430)
>     support realms that start with numbers (Dustin Wheeler) (Issue #437)
>   + Multipath: update to multipath-0.4.9-99.el7 (Xavier Mol)
>   + Php: also look for FPM files in /etc/php/\*/fpm/pool.d (Daniel Dico)
>   + Postfix\_virtual: allow underscores in e-mail addresses (Jason Lingohr)
>     (Issue #439)
>   + Radicale: new lens for config of <http://radicale.org/> (James Valleroy)
>   + Rsyslog: support multiple options in module statements (Craig Miskell)
>   + Ssh: also look for files in in /etc/ssh/ssh\_config.d (Ian Mortimer)
>   + Tmpfiles: parse 'q'/'Q' modes, parse two-character arguments,
>     parse three-digit file modes
>   + Xml: support external entity declarations in the doctype (Issue #142)
>   + Yum: also read DNF files from /etc/dnf (Pat Riehecky) (Issue #434)

## 1.7.0 - 2016-11-08

> * General changes/additions
>   + allow multiple transforms handling the same file as long as they
>     also use the same lens (reported by Rich Jones)
>   + fix a use-after-free in recursive lenses when spans are
>     enabled (Issue #397)
>   + fix an illegal memory access during put that can be triggered by a
>     lens of the form 'del ... | l1 . l2' when the put has to jump
>     branches in the union (Issue #398)
>   + a large number of fixes based on Coverity scanning and running with
>     gcc's address sanitizer. None of the issues uncovered would have lead
>     to particularly significant leaks (they were all on the order 100-200
>     bytes) and often hard to trigger, but we now have proof that at least
>     while running tests there are no leaks at all.
>     See <https://github.com/hercules-team/augeas/pull/405> for details.
>   + The type checker now checks regexes that are involved in
>     expressions. For example, it used to be possible to write 'let rx =
>     /a/ | /b)/' and not get an error from the syntax checker, even though
>     'let rx = /b)/' would result in an error. Such constructs are now
>     checked properly. This new check might lead to errors in existing
>     lenses, requiring that they be fixed.
> * Lens changes/additions
>   + Cron\_User: New lens to handle user crontab files in /var/spool/cron
>   + Csv: fix failure to load lens on OpenBSD (Issue #396)

>     (Rich Jones)
>   + Opendkim: new lens for /etc/opendkim.conf (Craig Miskell)
>   + Php: look for php.ini where Ubunto 16.04 puts it, too (Michael Wodniok)
>   + Splunk: support Splunk Universal Forwarder and underscore-prefixed
>     keys for 6.x (Jason Antman)

## 1.6.0 - 2016-08-05

> * General changes/additions
>   + augtool: add --load-file option, and corresponding load-file command
>     to load individual files based on the autoload information in lenses
>   + path expressions: numbers in path expressions are now 64 bit integers
>     rather than whatever the C compiler decided 'int' would be
> * API changes
>   + add aug\_load\_file to load individual files, bug #135
> * Lens changes/additions
>   + Httpd: follow line continuations in comments
>   + Nginx: look for nginx.conf in /usr/local/etc, too (Omer Katz)
>   + Ntp: allow 'pool' (Craig Miskell) (Issue #378);
>     fix restrict to allow also -4 and also fix
>     save/store ability (Josef Reidinger) (Issue #386)
>   + Pam: use spaces instead of tabs as the separator in new entries
>     (Loren Gordon) (Issue #236)
>   + Postfix\_Passwordmap: New lens to parse Postfix password maps
>     (Anton Baranov) (Issue #380)
>   + Rsyslog: Support for rsyslog RainerScript syntax
>     (Craig Miskell) (Issue #379)
>   + Shellvars: Load /etc/lbu/lbu.conf, the config for Alpine's Local
>     Backup Utility (Kaarle Ritvanen)
>     Load /etc/profile, /etc/profile.d/\*, and /etc/byobu
>   + Vsftpd: Add allow\_writeable\_chroot boolead option
>     (Robert Moucha) (Issue #376)

## 1.5.0 - 2016-05-11

> * General changes/additions
>   + augtool: new --timing option that prints after each operation how long
>     it took
>   + augtool: print brief help message when incorrect options are given rather
>     than dumping all help text
>   + Path expressions: optimize performance of evaluating certain
>     expressions
>   + lots of safety improvements in libfa to avoid using uninitialized
>     values and the like (Daniel Trebbien)
>   + tolerate building against OSX' libedit (Issue #256)
> * API changes
>   + aug\_match: fix a bug where expressions like /foo/\*[2] would match a
>     hidden node and pretend there was no match at all. We now make sure
>     we never match a hidden node. Thanks to Xavier Mol for reporting the
>     problem.
>   + aug\_get: make sure we set \*value to NULL, even if the provided path is
>     invalid (Issue #372)
>   + aug\_rm: fix segfault when deleting a tree and one of its ancestors
>     (Issue #319)
>   + aug\_save: fix segfault when trying to save an invalid subtree. A

## 1.4.0 - 2015-05-22

> * General changes/additions
>   + add a aug\_escape\_name call to sanitize strings for use in path
>     expressions. There are a few characters that are special in path

>     guaranteed to only match a node with exactly that name

## 0.10.0 - 2011-12-02

* support relative paths by taking them relative to the value
  of /augeas/context in all API functions where paths are used
* add aug\_to\_xml to API: transform tree(s) into XML, exposed as dump-xml
  in aug\_srun and augtool. Introduces dependency on libxml2

* [new primitive lens 'value'](http://augeas.net/docs/lenses.html) to set value of a node to a constant,
  similar to 'label' for the key
* [new builtins for printing and getting the types of a lens](http://augeas.net/docs/builtins.html)
* add unit type to lens language; allow '\_' as an identifier in let's to
  force evaluation for side effect only
* Various fixes for Solaris. Augeas now builds cleanly on Solaris 5.10,
  and most of the tests pass. The three tests that fail all fail because
  the test scripts have Linux idiosyncrasies. This needs to be addressed
  in a future release. Much thanks to Dagobert Michelsen and the [OpenCSW
  project](http://www.opencsw.org/) for providing me with access to their
  build farm.
* fix crash when recursive lens was used in a nonrecursive lens (bug #100)
* context free parser/recursive lenses: handle 'l?' properly (bug #119);
  distinguish between successful parse and parse with an error at end of
  input; do caller filtering to avoid spurious ambiguous parses with
  grammars containing epsilon productions

* much better error message when iteration stops prematurely during
  put/create than the dreaded 'Short iteration'
* augtool: ignore empty lines from stdin; report error when get fails
* fix memory leak in file\_info (transform.c); this was leaking a file
  name every time we loaded a file (Laine Stump)
* nicer error message when typechecker spots ambiguity in atype
* libfa: handle '(a|)' and 'r{min,}' properly
* locale independence: handle a literal '|' properly on systems that lack
  use\_locale

## 0.7.0 - 2010-01-14

* Support for context-free lenses via the 'let rec' keyword. The syntax
  is experimental, though the feature is here to stay. See
  lenses/json.aug for an example of what's possible with that.
* Support for case-insensitive regular expressions. Simply append 'i' to
  a regexp literal to make it case-insensitive, e.g. /hello/i will match
  all variations of hello, regardless of case.
* Major revamp of augtool. In particular, path expressions don't need to
  be quoted anymore. The online help has been greatly improved.

  under /augeas/load. If there are multiple transforms for a file, the
  file is skipped.

  putting the new file in place atomically with rename(2); file contents
  are only copied after rename fails with EXDEV or EBUSY, and only if the
  node /augeas/save/copy\_if\_rename\_fails (fix #32)
* saving of backup (.augsave) files now works even if the original and
  backup files are on different devices
* major refactoring of how path expressions are handled internally. Fixes
  a number of bugs and oddities (e.g. tickets #7 and #23)

  to aug\_init, aug\_save would always fail

## 0.3.3 - 2008-10-24

* restore the behavior of aug\_save; in 0.3.2, aug\_save broke API by
  returning the number of files changed on success instead of 0

## 0.3.2 - 2008-10-21

* aug\_save now reports which files were actually changed in
  /augeas/events/saved; it also returns the number of files
  that were changed
* preserve file owner, permissions and SELinux context when changing a file.
* make saving idempotent, i.e. when a change to the tree does not result
  in changes to the actual file's content, do not touch the original file
* report an error if there are nodes in the tree with a label that
  is not allowed by the lens
* quietly append a newline to files that do not have one
* generate lens documentation using NaturalDocs and publish those
  on the Auegas website (Raphael Pinson)

  + Shellvars: support /etc/default (Free Ekanayaka)
  + Shellvars: handle space at the end of a line

## 0.3.1 - 2008-09-04

* Major performance improvement when processing huge files, reducing some
  O(n^2) behavior to O(n) behavior. It's now entirely feasible to
  manipulate for example /etc/hosts files with 65k lines
* Handle character escapes in regular expressions in compliance with
  Posix ERE
* aug\_mv: fix bug when moving at the root level
* Fix endless loop when using a mixed-case module name like MyMod.lns
* Typecheck del lens: for del RE STR, STR must match RE
* Properly typecheck the '?' operator, especially the atype; also allow
  '?' to be applied to lenses that contain only 'store', and do not
  produce tree nodes.

* New lenses
  + /etc/exports: NFS exports

* Fix segfault when aug\_init/close are called multiple times
* Man page for augparse
* New lens for /etc/sysconfig/selinux, bugfixes for grub.conf

## 0.2.0 - 2008-06-05

* Augeas is now much more portable
  + Pull in gnulib on non-glibc systems
  + Augeas now builds and runs on FreeBSD (possibly others, too)
* Various fixes for memory corruption and the like (Jim Meyering, James Antill)
* New lenses
  + vsftpd.conf
  + various bugfixes in existing lenses

## 0.1.1 - 2008-05-16

* Add subtraction of regexps to the language, for example let re =

* Man page for augtool (Dean Wilson)

## 0.0.8 - 2008-04-16

* Complete rewrite of the language for schema descriptions

* Typecheck lenses; in particular, discover and complain about ambiguous
  concatenation and iteration
* Enable typechecking for augparse by default, and for augtool via the
  '-c' flag
* Fixed lens definitions in spec/ to pass typechecking. They contained
  quite a few stupid and subtle problems

  fast. Typechecking cmfm.aug went from more than two hours to under two
  seconds

## 0.0.6 - 2008-03-05

* Make it possible to overwrite files when saving with and without

* further rework; file processing now resembles Boomerang lenses much
  more closely
* major revamp of the internal tree representation (ordered tree where
  multiple children can have the same label, including NULL labels)
* move away from LL(1) parsing in favor of regular languages, since they
  enable much better ahead-of-time checks (which are not implemented yet)

## 0.0.2 - 2008-01-29:

* completely reworked
* processing of files is now based on a textual description of the
  structure of the files (basically a LL(1) grammar)

## 0.0.1 - 2007-12-01:

* First release.
* Public API and basic tree data structure.
* Record scanning works.
* Providers for pam.d, inittab and /etc/hosts
* Simple tests and test driver

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=772257#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-06 15:57:59 UTC  ``` Augeas is a configuration management API that represents the contents of config files as a tree in memory for editing, with the edits being written back to the actual file. By default it loads files it understands in a large number of standard system locations (/etc, /boot), but can also open files in a user specified location [1],[2].  It has two save modes of interest, "backup" that keeps the original in PATH.augorig and "newfile" that leaves the file alone, but writes the edited version to PATH.augnew. These can be set via the API [3] or --backup/--new with augtool (CLI tool around the API).  A flaw was found in the current 0.10.0 version and most previous versions.  It requires that the directory containing the file to be edited is writable by another user, so this needs the user to explicitly open a file in another location or for a file in a default location to be in a group/world writable directory.  Augeas always opens PATH.augnew for writing, sets the file modes identically to PATH, writes the file contents and then renames PATH.augnew to PATH.  Creation of a symlink at PATH.augnew will cause the new file contents to be written to the symlink target and then the symlink is moved to PATH. This enables an attacker to get to the file contents in the symlink target and also subvert PATH.  The code's at src/transform.c in transform_save [4].

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=772257#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-06 15:57:59 UTC  ``` Augeas is a configuration management API that represents the contents of config files as a tree in memory for editing, with the edits being written back to the actual file. By default it loads files it understands in a large number of standard system locations (/etc, /boot), but can also open files in a user specified location [1],[2].  It has two save modes of interest, "backup" that keeps the original in PATH.augorig and "newfile" that leaves the file alone, but writes the edited version to PATH.augnew. These can be set via the API [3] or --backup/--new with augtool (CLI tool around the API).  A flaw was found in the current 0.10.0 version and most previous versions.  It requires that the directory containing the file to be edited is writable by another user, so this needs the user to explicitly open a file in another location or for a file in a default location to be in a group/world writable directory.  Augeas always opens PATH.augnew for writing, sets the file modes identically to PATH, writes the file contents and then renames PATH.augnew to PATH.  Creation of a symlink at PATH.augnew will cause the new file contents to be written to the symlink target and then the symlink is moved to PATH. This enables an attacker to get to the file contents in the symlink target and also subvert PATH.  The code's at src/transform.c in transform_save [4].

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1537)

## Topic

Updated augeas packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Augeas is a utility for editing configuration. Augeas parses configuration
files in their native formats and transforms them into a tree.
Configuration changes are made by manipulating this tree and saving it back
into native configuration files. Augeas also uses "lenses" as basic
building blocks for establishing the mapping from files into the Augeas
tree and back.

Multiple flaws were found in the way Augeas handled configuration files
when updating them. An application using Augeas to update configuration
files in a directory that is writable to by a different user (for example,
an application running as root that is updating files in a directory owned
by a non-root service user) could have been tricked into overwriting
arbitrary files or leaking information via a symbolic link or mount point
attack. (CVE-2012-0786, CVE-2012-0787)

The augeas package has been upgraded to upstream version 1.0.0, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
(BZ#817753)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, when single quotes were used in an XML attribute, Augeas was

unable to parse the file with the XML lens. An upstream patch has been
provided ensuring that single quotes are handled as valid characters and
parsing no longer fails. (BZ#799885)

* Prior to this update, Augeas was unable to set up the "require\_ssl\_reuse"

option in the vsftpd.conf file. The updated patch fixes the vsftpd lens to
properly recognize this option, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#855022)

* Previously, the XML lens did not support non-Unix line endings.

Consequently, Augeas was unable to load any files containing such line
endings. The XML lens has been fixed to handle files with CRLF line
endings, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#799879)

* Previously, Augeas was unable to parse modprobe.conf files with spaces

around "=" characters in option directives. The modprobe lens has been
updated and parsing no longer fails. (BZ#826752)

All Augeas users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
