  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2012-0786",
    "description": "A flaw was found in the current 0.10.0 version and most previous versions.  It requires that the directory containing the file to be edited is writable by another user, so this needs the user to explicitly open a file in another location or for a file in a default location to be in a group/world writable directory.  Augeas always opens PATH.augnew for writing, sets the file modes identically to PATH, writes the file contents and then renames PATH.augnew to PATH.  Creation of a symlink at PATH.augnew will cause the new file contents to be written to the symlink target and then the symlink is moved to PATH. This enables an attacker to get to the file contents in the symlink target and also subvert PATH.",
    "affectedComponents": [
      "Augeas"
    ],
    "rootCause": "A symlink attack vulnerability exists during the saving process of a file. Specifically, the application creates a temporary file (PATH.augnew), copies the original file's attributes, writes the new content, and then renames it back to the original file. However, if an attacker creates a symlink at the location of the temporary file, the new content will be written to the symlink target.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Symlink attack during the saving process.",
      "Writing to symlink targets instead of actual files"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could overwrite arbitrary files or leak information via the symlink attack.",
     "attackVectors": [
       "Creating a symlink at the location where the application creates the temporary file (PATH.augnew)."
     ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs write access to the directory containing the target file. The attacker also needs to create symlinks.",
    "additionalNotes": "The issue is related to how Augeas handles temporary files during the save process. Instead of creating temporary files with predictable names, it should save into a securely created temporary file and then rename."
