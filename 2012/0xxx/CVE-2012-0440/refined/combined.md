# 4.2.rc1, 4.0.3, 3.6.7, and 3.4.13 Security Advisory

Tuesday, Jan 31st, 2012
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* When a user creates a new account, Bugzilla doesn't correctly
  reject email addresses containing non-ASCII characters, which
  could be used to impersonate another user account.

* A CSRF vulnerability in the implementation of the JSON-RPC API
  could be used to make changes to bugs or execute some admin tasks
  without the victim's knowledge.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Account Impersonation
Affected:    2.0 to 3.4.13, 3.5.1 to 3.6.7, 3.7.1 to 4.0.3, 4.1.1 to 4.2rc1
Fixed In:    3.4.14, 3.6.8, 4.0.4, 4.2rc2
Description: When a user creates a new account, Bugzilla doesn't
             correctly reject email addresses containing non-ASCII
             characters, which could be used to impersonate another
             user account. Such email addresses could look visually
             identical to other valid email addresses, and an attacker
             could try to confuse other users and be added to bugs he
             shouldn't have access to.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=714472
CVE Number:  CVE-2012-0448

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    3.5.1 to 3.6.7, 3.7.1 to 4.0.3, 4.1.1 to 4.2rc1
Fixed In:    3.6.8, 4.0.4, 4.2rc2
Description: Due to a lack of validation of the Content-Type header
             when making POST requests to jsonrpc.cgi, a possible
             CSRF vulnerability was discovered. If a user visits an
             HTML page with some malicious JS code in it, an attacker
             could make changes to a remote Bugzilla installation on
             behalf of the victim's account by using the JSON-RPC API.
             The user would have had to be already logged in to the
             target site for the vulnerability to work.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718319
CVE Number:  CVE-2012-0440

|  | |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/535.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/18.0.1003.1 Safari/535.16
Steps to reproduce:
Hello,
No security token is used when a POST request is made in jsonrpc.cgi thus allowing an attacker to add as CC, to visit and bugs taken private, or restricted to certain users. To explore this it is necessary that a User with privileges to edit bugs, so the attacker creating a page specially crafted to add CC.
Reproduce:
Do a POST Request in <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/jsonrpc.cgi>, whit this content:
{"version":"1.1","method":"Bug.update","id":2,"params":{"ids":[629221],"cc":{"add":["youremail@hack.com"]}}}
Cheers,
Mario

I thought about that too a few days ago, but I wasn't sure how a testcase would look like. XML-RPC is not vulnerable, right?Assignee: general → webserviceComponent: Bugzilla-General → WebService

I suppose that to fix this problem, login cookies generated for JSON-RPC and normal web browsing should be different.

Frédéric, seeing your comments and the reason of this don't works in landfill.mozilla.org. It's seems this is not a security bug in bugzilla. Could you please confirm this?Is this a valid security issue?

I have been unable to write a testcase which works, so far. I tried:
<html>
<head>
<title>attack</title>
</head>
<body>
<form name="evil" action="<http://localhost/bugzilla/jsonrpc.cgi>"
method="POST" enctype="application/json">
<input type="hidden" name="version" value="1.1">
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="2">
<input type="hidden" name="method" value="Bug.add\_comment">
<input type="hidden" name="params" value='[{"id":1004,"comment":"attack"}]'>
</form>
<script>document.evil.submit();</script>
</body>
</html>
I also tried enctype="text/plain" or removing enctype, but none of my attempts worked. Maybe my testcase is wrong.
Which testcase did you use to validate this issue?

but, i don't have success. I'm trying exploit this yet.

<form action='<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/jsonrpc.cgi?version=1.1&method=Bug.update&params>=[{"ids":[718319],"cc":{"add":["netfuzzer@gmail.com"]}}]' method="POST">

Yes, your PoC works fine. I managed to make a bug public remotely without any action from the user, besides waiting for him to view my HTML page. So I think we should go towards what I suggested in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=718319#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] JSON-RPC permits to bypass token checks and can lead to CSRF (no victim's action required)") to prevent this vulnerability.
Bugzilla 3.4.x and older are not affected as JSON-RPC has been implemented in Bugzilla 3.5.1, see [bug 432907](/show_bug.cgi?id=432907 "RESOLVED FIXED - Create a JSON frontend for WebServices").
This is a critical issue, because with the power of e.g. Bug.update (which you could use to CC yourself to security bugs, or remove security restrictions), Group.update (which you could use to make yourself an admin by altering the regexp), and the coming Bugzilla.set\_parameters (which lets your edit \*all\* parameters), you could easily take control of any Bugzilla installation.Severity: normal → criticalStatus: UNCONFIRMED → NEWDepends on: [bz-json](/show_bug.cgi?id=432907 "RESOLVED FIXED - Create a JSON frontend for WebServices")Ever confirmed: trueFlags: blocking4.2+Flags: blocking4.0.4+Flags: blocking3.6.8+Summary: CSRF in bugzilla.mozilla.org allow add CC. → JSON-RPC permits to bypass token checks and can lead to CSRF (no victim's action required)Whiteboard: [Bugzilla 3.4.x and older not affected]Target Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 3.6Version: 4.3 → 3.5.1

 As near as I can tell, the PoC is not actually a security bug. LpSolit's reproduction depends on being able to do cross-domain XMLHttpRequests, which the browser disallows. If you're on a domain where CORS would allow you to make the request, then your administrator has explicitly trusted that domain and has essentially intentionally opened up this hole.
If you are in any other situation where you can do a cross-domain POST via an XMLHttpRequest, then there is an extremely serious security issue in your browser.
There's no risk of normal form posts to our jsonrpc.cgi, because they won't encode the sent data properly, and jsonrpc.cgi will reject it. I tested this and vetted it fairly carefully when writing the original implementation here.
If you're talking about exploiting this via an attachment on a Bugzilla on the same domain, our existing attachment\_base functionality is the solution there. It opens all attachments on a separate domain. This prevents attachments on a Bugzilla from running scripts against that Bugzilla, which is our general solution for this entire class of problems.

No, the CORS allows me to send the request, prohibits only have access to the server response.
exemple(openning this in <http://127.0.0.1/exemple.html>:
x=new XMLHttpRequest();
x.open('GET','<http://www.bugzilla.org>');
x.send('');
document.write(x.responseText);
the GET request will be sent, but the browser will not allow i get the value of "x.responseText". So, i can send the POST from 127.0.0.1 to www.bugzilla.mozilla.org, but i can't get the response of Mozilla.

 Right. Okay, I didn't realize that browsers would allow cross-domain requests with XMLHttpRequest to actually ever leave the browser. However, here's the correct info:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_control#Simple_requests>
The solution here is that we need to validate the Content-Type header as being the proper json-rpc header. None of the allowed browser cross-domain Content-Types should be accepted by jsonrpc.cgi, ever.

What's the expected header for JSON-RPC? Also, I see no reason to reject remote read-only methods. They would be useful e.g. to display information of bugs in the See Also field.

We still need to add CSRF token checks. Just having content-type header checks is not enough, as the above link says.

The link doesn't say this check is not enough. It says: "So even with application/json checking, you can get pretty close to XSRF, if not completely there. [...] So whilst you can probably get away with it for now, I absolutely wouldn't recommend going forward without a proper anti-XSRF token system.".
We would have to investigate how much code change is required for token checks before implementing it on branches, and the implications it could have on 3rd party applications using the JSON-RPC API.

I suppose for all WRITE operations, we require a token and add a new call to get this token generated using IP/userid/secret/etc. Will make all creates/updates a two step process but will be more secure in the long run. READ operations of course would still work without token.

A blacklist is asking for future trouble when HTML5 adds new types.
In addition, a case-sensitive match is fooled by
text/Plain
Text/plain
TEXT/PLAIN
... rest of the 2^9 variants
Firefox coerces the <form enctype=> to lower-case but does not do so for XMLHttpRequest headers. I don't know what other browsers do but I would not stake a critical security check on them consistently lower-casing.

Ah yes, you are right about the case-sensitive match. I fixed that.
About blacklisting vs whitelisting, I'm not sure a whitelist is better as new types could appear, as you said yourself. Is there any official list of legal content types for JSON-RPC?

For the branches, instead of limiting it to a specific content-type, we should blacklist all the legal XMLHttpRequest content types. That way we're less likely to break legitimate integrations that are using JSON-RPC on the branches with some unexpected content-type.

Just checking that it starts with application/json should be enough.

Just to respond to this:
There are three versions of JSON-RPC, 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0. They have their own specification that is not an RFC. application/json-rpc is the MIME type from one of those specifications.

patch for branches, v1.1
This is the patch I initially suggested, which blacklists the 3 content types which could be used with XMLHttpRequest. But dveditz said this was less safe. Please review it for branches, but based on what I found on the web and per my discussion with dveditz, there should be no reason to accept another content type than application/json.

Version 1.1 states that the recommended Content-Type when using POST is application/json:
<http://json-rpc.org/wd/JSON-RPC-1-1-WD-20060807.html#RequestHeaders>
Version 2.0 says it follows RFC 4627, which uses application/json:
<http://jsonrpc.org/spec.html>
It looks like application/json-rpc was only used for the never published version 1.2.
Version 1.0 doesn't seem to enforce the value of Content-Type, which is a bit annoying. So I suppose it makes sense to use a blacklist on older branches.

This fixes the bug as far as we have actually reproduced it, and it (hopefully) won't be breaking clients who are setting things properly. I'm fine with having a less-complete fix on the branches unless we have another PoC that can get past this patch.

A few things about that:
(1) That's the spec for JSON-RPC itself, not for JSON-RPC Over HTTP, which is a separate standard that's still being worked on.
(2) The 2.0 standard has evolved over time, and some clients may be sending as application/json-rpc, so we should accept it.

Thanks for the clarifications. Does it mean we should accept application/json-rpc for trunk + 4.2 too? Per my discussion with dveditz, it seemed it was fine to decide what we wanted as valid Content-Type values, and what we didn't want.Flags: approval4.0?Flags: approval3.6?

Attached patch

[patch for 3.6, v2](attachment.cgi?id=592737&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=592737&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=718319&attachment=592737)

On 3.6, the patch applied cleanly in JSONRPC.pm (with some fuzz), but when I checked, the code was applied at the wrong place. So here is a patch for 3.6 specifically. The reason for the fuzz is that in 3.6, JSONRPC.pm only accepts the POST method, and so the code is a bit different. It's a trivial backport of the patch for 4.0.

The patch works for 3.6 as far as using text/plain gives the proper error message. When using the other blacklisted content types, jsonrpc.cgi dies and gives the following error in the log:
[Mon Jan 30 18:29:55 2012] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] [Mon Jan 30 18:29:55 2012] jsonrpc.cgi: Malformed multipart POST: data truncated
Should we worry about this as it still fixes the vulnerability either way but it would be nice to see a proper error message when json::rpc doesn't understand the content-type. The error is coming from CGI.pm fwiw.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
r=dkl as this accomplishes the task of blocking the CSRF attack. I am not sure it is worth
worrying about the other content-types throwing the CGI.pm error as this would happen up
until now and anyway wanting their JSONRPC calls to work would not do it that way.

patch for 3.6, v2
As the goal is to ban these "illegal" content types, I don't care too much if the user doesn't get the error message in this case.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)

* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
