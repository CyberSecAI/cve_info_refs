Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2012-0051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the mutable downloader of Tahoe-LAFS version 1.9.0. Specifically, the share-hash-tree check during the download process is unintentionally bypassed under certain conditions. This bypass occurs when the Merkle hash tree is already fully populated in a share.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integrity Check Bypass:** The core issue is that the share-hash-tree validation step, intended to ensure the integrity of the downloaded data, is skipped when the Merkle hash tree is fully populated.
- **Lack of Unconditional Validation:** The check was implemented with an accidental "if" clause, instead of being unconditionally enforced, which led to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Corruption:** An attacker can manipulate shares to bypass the integrity check. By crafting shares with a fully populated Merkle hash tree, they can modify the data in other shares without detection.
- **Bit Flipping:** This allows the attacker to control the input to the ZFEC decoder, potentially flipping bits of the plaintext.
- **Potential Information Leak:** Though primarily an integrity failure, the ability to manipulate the plaintext can potentially lead to information leaks, especially if the manipulated data has a known structure.
- **Persistent Corruption:** If a client performs a read-modify-write operation on corrupted data, the corruption can become persistent.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Compromised Storage Servers:** The attacker needs to control one or more of the storage servers to deliver multiple, crafted shares to the client.
- **Specific Share Order:** The attacker has to deliver the modified shares in a particular order. The first share needs to have valid block data to pass the initial checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over Storage Servers:** The attacker needs control of one or more of the storage servers used by the Tahoe-LAFS system.
- **Knowledge of MDMF Format:** Understanding how the Merkle hash trees and shares work within the MDMF format is necessary to create the malicious shares.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced with the MDMF-capable downloader rewrite around August 1, 2011, in git revision `ac3b2647dd2c45cd1ddbf5b130ee5a780c66c73b`.
- The vulnerability was present in the released version of Tahoe-LAFS 1.9.0.
- The fix involves removing the accidental "if" clause, making the share-hash-tree check unconditional, which is included in version 1.9.1, and commit `9b4b03a474a2c9050c8347459ab6698839be7288`.
- The vulnerability is located in `src/allmydata/mutable/retrieve.py`, specifically within the `Retrieve._validate_block` method, around the call to `share_hash_tree.set_hashes()`.
