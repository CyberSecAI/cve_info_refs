Attached file
[POC files to reproduce bug, along with some screenshots](attachment.cgi?id=558117)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=558117&action=edit)

Under windows 7 32-bit, a crash can be caused with the attached code.
The simplest POC code includes a parent and one child window. The parent window spawns the child and after a short delay invokes a 'file open' dialog from the child. Then the parent closes the child window. This causes an exploitable crash.
Pre-requisites:
\* JavaScript enabled
\* Ability to create at least one pop-up window (not a tab)
[browser.link.open\_newwindow -> 2] [or a popup blocker bypass]
\* Firefox 5, 6 or Nightly [other versions not tested]
In the basic POC, the faulting instruction is a CALL to freed memory:
SHLWAPI!IUnknown\_QueryService+0x3b:
76d842a1 ff11 call dword ptr [ecx]
ds:0023:feeefeee=????????
Note that 0xfeeefeee is what is placed into Windows memory which has been HeapFree'd.
We are also attaching an exploit POC; this uses two child windows.
Due to certain allocation sequences, it turns out that 0x10693AEA ends up being in ECX about 30% of the time. Believe it or not, this address comes from the binary representation of the GUID for "my computer" {20d04fe0-3aea-1069-a2d8-08002b30309d} which ends up in the memory where ECX gets loaded. So a stable pointer value turns up in ECX quite often. On 32-bit Windows 7, a heap spray can arrange for page-aligned data to turn up at 0x10693AEA.
With more work on heap feng shui (i.e, using javascript to control memory allocations) it may be possible to get 0x10693AEA into ECX more reliably or in fact directly control the value which goes into ECX.
The exploit POC should show 0x0c0c0c0c at the top of the call stack. We have got code execution on Windows 7 with DEP turned off; it is also possible to get this to work on stock Windows 7 using a heap-based ROP.
We were only able to reproduce this issue on Windows 7 32-bit (XP and Win7 64 did not crash). Non-windows operating systems should not be vulnerable.

Hi, Scott has created a bugzilla account.
I submitted "b01bd2db-fcb7-481f-b1aa-037102110904" from the simple POC. The IUnknown\_QueryService signature has a reasonable number of crashes and I would hazard a guess that they all have the same root cause. The comments refer to file save/open dialogs and the crash only happens on 32-bit Windows 7.

So I can't reproduce this on GNU/Linux (with GTK) and MacOS X. It seems reproducible on Windows 7. Though, to reproduce this bug you have to enable the popup blocker and change browser.link.open\_newwindow pref to '2'. It seems to reduce the seriousness of the issue.
Likely, the crash cause is somewhere in Windows widget code instead of the DOM code.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWComponent: DOM: Core & HTML → Widget: Win32Ever confirmed: trueQA Contact: general → win32Hardware: x86 → All

Attached file
[PoC (works with pop-up blocker enabled)](attachment.cgi?id=560658)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=560658&action=edit)

This PoC works with 'browser.link.open\_newwindow' set to 3 (open in tab by default) and with pop-up blocker enabled.

I have attached another PoC which works with 'browser.link.open\_newwindow -> 3' (default, open new links in tab) and with the pop-up blocker enabled. The original setting where 'browser.link.open\_newwindow -> 2' turns out not to be required. We have also reproduced this on Win7-64 bit.

Jst, I believe it would be better to assign this to someone who knows Windows Widget code. I'm unassigning myself so the bug will likely shows up in some list. Though, if you still want me to work on it, feel free to re-assign me.Assignee: mounir → nobody

From what I've seen is that the crash happens on DispatchMessag for a message of WM\_TIMER. I'm still investigating if this is accurate or not and if so which window.

I spent another night on it after work this week but did not make much progress.
I don't think I'll have much time to look at it before Nov 8 because I'm working on getting a huge 20 patch task ([bug 481815](/show_bug.cgi?id=481815 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide a Windows service to update applications without asking Administrator password")) into v10 for silent update.
If Jim or anyone else would like to pick up this task in the meantime that would be great.
I'll send a follow up email to Jim asking him specificaly if he has any time to pick it up.
Here are some notes I collected while debugging:
- The crash happens on DispatchMessage
- There is no window title on the HWND that it is being dispatched to.
- The window class is WorkerW
- There are 4 messages of exactly WM\_APP sent, and one WM\_TIMER (wParam 1, lParam 0) before the crash, no other messages are sent to that window.
- The crash happens on a 6th message of type WM\_TIMER which has (wParam 2, lParam 0)
- There is a special case inside the remarks of the documentation of DispatchMessage that WM\_TIMER with lParam non NULL will call the function of the lParam. But in our crashing case lParam is non NULL.
- IsWindow returns TRUE just before the crash on that handle
- It doesn't seem to be anything we're doing obviously wrong, except maybe some kind of memory corruption like freeing twice.
- One way to fix might be to manually close all children window on Destroy() of nsWindow.

This seems similar to [bug 487700](/show_bug.cgi?id=487700 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Alert box no longer has focus after closing popup"). There we had focus problems with alerts (before we removed the native version) created by popups that were closed. The window tear down happens async, leaving the windows dialog around.
Just starting to look at this specific case, will post what I find.

Not yet. I was hoping to get back to this this week but haven't gotten there yet, Maybe tomorrow or Monday. I think it's fixable, it's just a matter of figuring out what tweak we need to avoid it.

Some notes -
We make the api call to display the dialog and after entering the internal modal event loop within the call we call DestroyWindow on the parent.
The dialog call then exits, the parent nsWindow and the file picker get torn down, and that's it until a spurious message is delivered to a child window that should be in the now destroyed picker dialog. Note though, the dialog call exit is actually an exception in Windows code caught by the try/catch block we have this call wrapped in. If I remove the try/catch trap shell32 generates an exception much sooner, fx crashes, and that's it.
I've done some experimenting to isolate all the buffer allocation work we do in file picker to be sure that isn't part of the problem. This didn't help, so it doesn't look like our quick tear down of the file picker is the issue.
So it seems what we are doing is unanticipated by Windows and there's not much we can do in file picker to prevent this.

I spent some time looking for ways to avoid this at a higher level but didn't find anything. So I decided to put this together. This is a bit of a hack but it works. I'm going to do a bit more investigating tomorrow, if I don't find a better way I'll kick off reviews on this patch.

After some additional experimenting I think the first patch is the solution we should go with for now. Caveat here is that we are trying to address a security related issue, so a minor corner case trade off is acceptable. The side effect of this patch is that it doesn’t automatically close the picker with the underlying browser window – the picker hangs around until the user closes it. Since this is a corner case which would involve bad content design it’s not something users would run into, and it’s easily overcome by simply closing the picker. The other negative side effect is that without auto-closing the picker I can’t write an automated test for this. The good news is it prevents the exception from happening mitigating the vulnerability.
There is some additional good news - we can fix the auto-close picker problem, but the fix relies on the fix for [bug 661991](/show_bug.cgi?id=661991 "VERIFIED FIXED - Start using the new Common Item Dialogs in Vista and later in nsFilePicker"). The core problem here is that we don’t have a way to get at the HWND of the picker from the hidden shim child or browser window we know about due to idiosyncrasies in the way Windows handles parenting of these dialogs. There’s a clean way of getting at the HWND we need but it requires the use of callback procedures built into these dialogs. Unfortunately due to some issues with the older calls we make, we can’t leverage these callbacks on Vista and up. [bug 661991](/show_bug.cgi?id=661991 "VERIFIED FIXED - Start using the new Common Item Dialogs in Vista and later in nsFilePicker") is all about upgrading our calls so we can start using those procedures, in which case we can add auto-close functionality and a test to our work there.
Depending on our plans for landing of this fix the auto-close problem may not be an issue - I’m going to push the priority of [bug 661991](/show_bug.cgi?id=661991 "VERIFIED FIXED - Start using the new Common Item Dialogs in Vista and later in nsFilePicker") up so that we get it out in the Dec. 20th merge. If we plan on running this fix through a full release cycle, we’ll be able to fix the remaining issues before then. If however we were thinking of pushing this out to aurora it’ll have to stand on it’s own for at least one release cycle.
I need to do some cleanup and run this through try, then I'll kick off a review from bbondy and an sr from roc.

I haven't looked at the patch yet, but does this keep the file picker open even when you right click on the taskbbar and click to close that way? I.e. when the filepicker is already shown? If so that seems like a pretty big problem.
Also it seems we can try to make a hook callback fix in Windows XP as of this patch, we just can't use it for Vista and later. For [bug 661991](/show_bug.cgi?id=661991 "VERIFIED FIXED - Start using the new Common Item Dialogs in Vista and later in nsFilePicker") that will only help Vista and later.

If the window with the form is visible and has a file picker open, windows prevents you from closing it via the taskbar. (This from testing using the thumbnail close button on Win7 for the browser window.) Generally the picker is modal, so you can't usually get to the underlying window. Except of course through script.

Thought about adding this but decided it wasn't worth adding to the complexity of this fix just to address the issue on XP.

Also, I should add, if you close the main window (in this poc, the window with 'Click Me' in it) and let script close the form browser, you are left with the file picker and nothing in the taskbar to click on. That's the one ugly side effect from a user's perspective if perchance they somehow landed on a site that resulted in this happening.

I probably don't fully understand the scope of the side effect yet until I review the patch, but will we want the side effect to live in XP forever?
I thought something crazy like > 50% of our users are XP. If the side effect is only in cases similar to steps to reproduce for this bug (i.e. only via script closing), then I don't think it's a big deal.

I was thinking we could fix both, since on XP we have the callbacks and can use them to address the problem. I just didn't want to add that complexity to the patch in this bug.

Not fully true, see below.
If the "Show tabpreviews in the Windows taskbar" is on, you can close the parent window without the child filepicker even know it is Modal in 2 ways:
1) By using the close button on the preview.
2) By right clicking on the preview and selecting close.
So that problem can happen even outside of scripting.
This is not on by default in FF though, so it's not a huge deal. A lot of people use it though.
I think the trade off is fine and I think it will probably be a non issue anyway since the other bug will likely land before the 20th.

I didn't want to blow away blame, but since I've ended up reformatting the whole thing in [bug 661991](/show_bug.cgi?id=661991 "VERIFIED FIXED - Start using the new Common Item Dialogs in Vista and later in nsFilePicker") it doesn't make any difference. Will update.

The patch is pretty safe, it involves some innocuous trickery in widget when we open the picker. It would be better to roll this out with the patches in [bug 661991](/show_bug.cgi?id=661991 "VERIFIED FIXED - Start using the new Common Item Dialogs in Vista and later in nsFilePicker") though if we could. See [comment 32](/show_bug.cgi?id=684555#c32 "VERIFIED FIXED - Exploitable \"use after free\" @ SHLWAPI!IUnknown_QueryService 0x3b") for the detail as to why.

picker close crash test
This failed on one out of four test runs (xp debug). I need to figure out how to make this more reliable.

I've verified this is fixed in beta 4 of Firefox 11 and nightly Aurora (Firefox 12) from 2/27 with the second PoC. The original PoC wasn't causing a visible issue on Win 7 SP1 32-bit. Firefox 10.0.2 still crashes with the second PoC with [bp-1ddce430-2ad1-48a5-bce6-2ddfa2120228](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/1ddce430-2ad1-48a5-bce6-2ddfa2120228).
I've also verified this as fixed in the trunk build from 2/27.Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

An update that fixes 12 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes three new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to 10.0.3 ESR to fix various
bugs and security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-19: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References:
Bob Clary reported two bugs that causes crashes that
affected Firefox 3.6, Firefox ESR, and Firefox 10.
CVE-2012-0461
Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Nils, Michael
Bebenita, Dindog, and David Anderson reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR and Firefox
10. CVE-2012-0462
Jeff Walden reported a memory safety problem in the
array.join function. This bug was independently reported by
Vincenzo Iozzo via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
Pwn2Own contest. CVE-2012-0464
Masayuki Nakano reported a memory safety problem that
affected Mobile Firefox
\*
CVE-2012-0463
\*
MFSA 2012-18 / CVE-2012-0460: Mozilla developer Matt
Brubeck reported that window.fullScreen is writeable by
untrusted content now that the DOM fullscreen API is
enabled. Because window.fullScreen does not include
mozRequestFullscreen's security protections, it could be
used for UI spoofing. This code change makes
window.fullScreen read only by untrusted content, forcing
the use of the DOM fullscreen API in normal usage.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by
this vulnerability.
\*
MFSA 2012-17 / CVE-2012-0459: Mozilla community
member Daniel Glazman of Disruptive Innovations reported a
crash when accessing a keyframe's cssText after dynamic
modification. This crash may be potentially exploitable.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by
this vulnerability.
\*
MFSA 2012-16 / CVE-2012-0458: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that an attacker able to convince
a potential victim to set a new home page by dragging a
link to the "home" button can set that user's home page to
a javascript: URL. Once this is done the attacker's page
can cause repeated crashes of the browser, eventually
getting the script URL loaded in the privileged
about:sessionrestore context.
\*
MFSA 2012-15 / CVE-2012-0451: Security Researcher
Mike Brooks of Sitewatch reported that if multiple Content
Security Policy (CSP) headers are present on a page, they
have an additive effect page policy. Using carriage return
line feed (CRLF) injection, a new CSP rule can be
introduced which allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) on
sites with a separate header injection vulnerability.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by
this vulnerability.
\*
MFSA 2012-14 / CVE-2012-0457 / CVE-2012-0456:
Security researcher Atte Kettunen from OUSPG found two
issues with Firefox's handling of SVG using the Address
Sanitizer tool. The first issue, critically rated, is a
use-after-free in SVG animation that could potentially lead
to arbitrary code execution. The second issue is rated
moderate and is an out of bounds read in SVG Filters. This
could potentially incorporate data from the user's memory,
making it accessible to the page content.
\*
MFSA 2012-13 / CVE-2012-0455: Firefox prevents the
dropping of javascript: links onto a frame to prevent
malicious sites from tricking users into performing a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on themselves. Security
researcher Soroush Dalili reported a way to bypass this
protection.
\*
MFSA 2012-12 / CVE-2012-0454: Security researchers
Blair Strang and Scott Bell of Security Assessment found
that when a parent window spawns and closes a child window
that uses the file open dialog, a crash can be induced in
shlwapi.dll on 32-bit Windows 7 systems. This crash may be
potentially exploitable.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by
this vulnerability.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
