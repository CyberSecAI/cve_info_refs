Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
Vulnerability-Lab Team discovered multiple persistent Web Vulnerabilities on Zimbras Prism Desktop Application.
Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2011-11-01: Vendor Notification
2012-01-12: Public or Non-Public Disclosure
Discovery Status:
=================
Published
Affected Product(s):
====================
Zimbra Inc.
Product: Zimbra Desktop 7.1.2 b10978
Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote
Severity Level:
===============
Medium
Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple input validation vulnerabilities(persistent) are detected on Zimbra Desktop v7.1.2. Local attackers can
include (persistent) malicious script code to manipulate specific customer/admin requests. The vulnerability
allows an local privileged attacker to manipulate the appliance(application) via persistent script code inject.
It is also possible to hijack customer sessions via persistent script code execution on application-side. Successful
exploitation can also result in context/module request manipulation, execution of persistent malicious script code,
session hijacking(account steal) & application-side mailbox phishing attacks.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched/fixed via restrict on the input fields and parse on the input/output section or listings.
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent software vulnerability is estimated as medium(-).
