    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected components handle shared content that contains specially crafted TrueType fonts. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views shared content that contains specially crafted TrueType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when specially crafted True Type Font (TTF) files are incorrectly handled.",
