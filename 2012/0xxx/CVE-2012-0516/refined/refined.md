The provided content discusses two vulnerabilities, CVE-2020-9315 and CVE-2020-9314, found in Oracle's iPlanet Web Server. It also mentions CVE-2012-0516 in the context of the second vulnerability but does not provide any specific details about it.

The advisory mentions that CVE-2020-9314 is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0516, specifically that a previous fix for XSS did not address external image loading. The description about CVE-2012-0516 is very limited in that sense. Since the original description about CVE-2012-0516 is not provided, it's not possible to make an adequate analysis of it. 

Therefore, the response is:
