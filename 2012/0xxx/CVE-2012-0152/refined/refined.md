Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-0152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the way the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service processes specially crafted packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  A denial-of-service vulnerability exists within the RDP service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause the RDP service to stop responding, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of specially crafted packets to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system's RDP service. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specifically a denial-of-service (DoS) issue, unlike CVE-2012-0002 which involves remote code execution.
- This vulnerability affects systems where the RDP service is running. Although RDP is not enabled by default, systems that have it enabled are at risk.
- While not explicitly stated, this vulnerability is considered less severe than CVE-2012-0002 (due to no code execution), but still requires patching.
- The provided document also references KB2667402 as the patch for CVE-2012-0152, and states that it was re-released to address a bug with the original update.
