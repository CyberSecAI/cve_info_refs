      "data": "Root cause of vulnerability: A password disclosure flaw was found in the way Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite Server, RHN Proxy Server and Spacewalk performed new system registration in the case of XMLRPC call failure.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: When a system registration XMLRPC call fails, the user's password is included in plain text within the error message.\n\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker with access to the server logs or server administrator's email can obtain the plaintext password of a RHN Satellite, Proxy, or Spacewalk user.\n\nAttack vectors: An attacker needs to trigger an XMLRPC system registration call failure to reveal the password.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to access server logs or the server administrator's email."

      "data": "Vulnerability details:\n- The vulnerability exists in Red Hat Network Satellite Server, RHN Proxy Server, and Spacewalk.\n- When a system registration fails via XML-RPC, the user's password is included in clear text in the error messages.\n- These error messages are stored in server logs and may be mailed to the server administrator.\n\nImpact:\n- An attacker with access to server logs or the administrator's email can obtain the user's password.\n\nMitigation:\n- The vulnerability is fixed by excluding passwords from error messages when XML-RPC calls fail."

      "data": "Summary:\n\n- The vulnerability was present in Red Hat Network Satellite, RHN Proxy Server, and Spacewalk when performing system registrations.\n- If a system registration XML-RPC call failed, the user's password would be included in plain text in the error messages which were stored in the server log and also mailed to the server administrator.\n- This would allow an administrator to obtain user passwords. \n\nFix:\n- The fix prevents user passwords from being included in error messages when a system registration XML-RPC call fails."
