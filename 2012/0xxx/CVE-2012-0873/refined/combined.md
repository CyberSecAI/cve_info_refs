36 comments.

Dolphin 7.0.8 is here with us, rectifying some security vulnerabilities and busting a mid-sized gang of virtual insects (aka bugs).
There're also some useful system tweaks, but really, you should've stopped reading and [started downloading](/paymentprovider/payment)
right after that "security" word in the first sentence. Seriously.

(loooooooong pause)... Now, that you've [upgraded](/trac/dolphin/wiki/7.0.7-7.0.8) and have some time to read...

## List of updates

* Important security problems were fixed
* CSS classes for BoonEx advertisement moved to CSS file to give more control for template developers

* Embedded videos could sometimes show wrong thumbnail when adding
* Some language changes
* Flash: audio player showed incorrect time when length is greater than 59:99
* Flash: guests now can now enter username, gender, age and description
* Flash: video player controls didn't automatically hidden in full-screen mode
* Forum: template reorganizing to give more control to template developers
* Forum: membership actions was not working right when actions count parameter was used
* Forum: deleted user displayed link and membership for currently logged in user
* Forum: timezone in RSS feed was different
* Mobile: profile's video and audio count was not showing and 500 != 200 error in Android app
* Mobile: number of displayed albums was limited to 10
* Mobile: videos page was opening when we click on "profile info" button

[**Closed tickets**](/trac/dolphin/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=Dolphin+7.0.8)

## FAQ

**Q:**
Where's an XYZ feature?

**A:**
Glad you asked. It may be coming in future versions or in some dreadful sequence of events has been overlooked.
Check [Trac](/trac/dolphin/wiki) and either submit your suggestion or wait for an existing ticket to be addressed.

**Q:**
But I know/see/found an unfixed bug!

**A:**
Bugger. Check [Trac](/trac/dolphin/wiki) and either submit your report or wait for an existing ticket to be addressed.
If you can't post to Trac, please [use this forum](/forums/forum/Dolphin-Bug-Reports-0.htm).

**Q:**
Is it a stable version that I can use on a live site?

**A:**
Yes. Note though, that "stable" is not a guarantee - it's a term used to label "supported" version,
so that when something is changed we will be providing upgrade instructions from this version to a new one.
It also means that it is **the most stable** version that we know of.

**Q:**
Is it a final 7.0.x update and will we some more heavyweight improvements in Dolphin 7?

**A:**
Dolphin 7 will continue to be developed, improved and supported for years ahead, so there's no way it's a "final" version in the line. Dolphin 8 will co-exist with Dolphin 7 for long time. Dolphin 7 licenses will work for Dolphin 8 too.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our

Subject: Dolphin 7.0.7 <= Multiple Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

1. OVERVIEW

Dolphin 7.0.7 and lower versions are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting.

2. BACKGROUND

Dolphin is the only "all-in-one" free community software platform for
creating your own social networking, community or online dating site
without any limits and under your full control. Dolphin comes with
hundreds of features, module plugins and tools. Everything is included
and extension posibilities are literally endless. You can use it for
free with a BoonEx link in the footer or buy a $99 permanent license
to remove that requirement.

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Multiple parameters (explain,photos_only,online_only,mode) were not
properly sanitized, which allows attacker to conduct Cross Site
Scripting attack. This may allow an attacker to create a specially
crafted URL that would execute arbitrary script code in a victim's
browser.

4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

7.0.7 and lower

5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

Vulnerable Parameter: explain
