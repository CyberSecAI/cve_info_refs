Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in a victim's browser by crafting a malicious URL. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript code in the `explain`, `photos_only`, `online_only`, and `mode` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs that include the malicious script. The attacker would typically distribute the malicious URL via social media, email, or other platforms, tricking victims into clicking the link. No special privileges or specific position on the target system are necessary.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameters are `explain`, `photos_only`, `online_only`, and `mode`.
- The vulnerable files are `explanation.php` and `viewFriends.php`.
- Example malicious URLs:
  - `http://localhost/dolph/explanation.php?explain=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28/xss/%29%3C/script%3E`
  - `http://localhost/dolph/viewFriends.php?iUser=1&page=1&per_page=32&sort=activity&photos_only='>"><script>alert(/xss/)</script>`
  - `http://localhost/dolph/viewFriends.php?iUser=1&page=1&per_page=32&sort=activity&online_only='>"><script>alert(/xss/)</script>`
  - `http://localhost/dolph/viewFriends.php?iUser=1&page=1&sort=activity&mode='>"><script>alert(/xss/)</script>`

**Affected Versions:**
- Dolphin versions 7.0.7 and lower are affected.
