  "CVE-2012-0148": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Ancillary Function Driver (afd.sys) due to improper validation of input from user mode to the Windows kernel. This could allow a local attacker with valid logon credentials to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
    "root_cause": "Improper validation of input passed from user mode to the Windows kernel by the Ancillary Function Driver (afd.sys).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, gaining complete control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access is required. An attacker needs to log on to the system and run a specially crafted application.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have valid logon credentials to the system.  They also require the ability to execute programs locally."
