- **Root cause:** An uninitialized memory access issue existed in the handling of X.509 certificates within libsecurity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Uninitialized memory access when processing X.509 certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Verifying a maliciously crafted X.509 certificate, such as when visiting a maliciously crafted website, may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Maliciously crafted X.509 certificates, potentially delivered via a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce the target system to verify a maliciously crafted X.509 certificate. This could be achieved by tricking the user to visit a malicious website.
