Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0809:

**Root Cause:**
- The `sudo_debug()` function in sudo versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.3p1 uses the program name as part of the format string passed to the `fprintf()` function.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The program name, which is attacker-controlled (via symbolic link or setting `argv[0]`), is used as a format string in `fprintf()`. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers, potentially leading to arbitrary memory reads/writes and code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation can allow an unauthorized local user to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The attacker doesn't need to be listed in the `sudoers` file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local user.
- **Manipulating Program Name:** The attacker controls the program name by:
   - Creating a symbolic link with format specifiers (e.g., `./%s`).
   - On some systems, setting `argv[0]` when executing sudo.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have a user account on the system where sudo is installed.
- **Ability to Execute sudo:** The attacker must be able to execute the `sudo` binary.
- **Knowledge of Format String Exploitation:** The attacker needs to be familiar with format string vulnerability exploitation techniques.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the debugging code of sudo, introduced in version 1.8.0.
- Building sudo with `FORTIFY_SOURCE` and other protections was initially thought to be a deterrent, but an integer overflow vulnerability in glibc's `FORTIFY_SOURCE` support code allows bypassing these protections.
- The vulnerability is fixed in sudo version 1.8.3p2.
- The provided information also mentions CVE-2011-0010, which is a separate vulnerability related to Runas Group password checking, but is not related to CVE-2012-0809.
