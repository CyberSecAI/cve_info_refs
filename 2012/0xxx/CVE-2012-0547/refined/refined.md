Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2012-0547:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is described as a "hardening fix" applied to the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) component in OpenJDK. This fix addresses an issue where functionality in the restricted `SunToolkit` class could be used in combination with other flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. Essentially, the original implementation provided a mechanism, that could be abused to bypass security measures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient access control:** The `SunToolkit` class exposed functionality (`getField` method) which could be used to access and modify private fields of objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Java sandbox restrictions:** Successful exploitation could allow untrusted Java applets or applications to access restricted parts of the system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security compromises.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Java applets/applications:** A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by persuading a user to run a specially crafted Java applet or application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely by hosting a malicious website that uses the flaw.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability could be exploited without the need for a username and password, making exploitation more accessible.
*   **User interaction:** The user needs to visit the malicious website or execute the malicious Java application.

**Additional Notes**

*   The content also mentions that this fix is considered a "security-in-depth" measure, meaning that it is not directly exploitable but it can be leveraged by attackers using other vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability affected multiple platforms including Linux, Windows, AIX, HP-UX and Solaris and several versions of OpenJDK, Oracle JDK and IBM JDK.
*   The fix involves changes to the AWT component in OpenJDK and includes a version update to IcedTea6.

In summary, CVE-2012-0547 represents a vulnerability where a method in the AWT package, specifically related to the `SunToolkit` class, could be abused to bypass the Java sandbox. This vulnerability is often paired with other sandbox escape techniques for a successful exploit. The patches address this by removing the vulnerable functionality.
