{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of proper checks on extracted filenames during the extraction of the zip file, allowing directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Directory traversal vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary file write or overwrite outside of the intended application folder, leading to potential execution of malicious code.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted zip file with directory traversal patterns in filenames served by a web server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to host a malicious zip file on a web server and lure the victim to load the associated HTML page that references the malicious zip file."
