Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0069:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection.
- Specifically, it occurs in the `boxToReload` parameter of the `ajax.php` file of Batavi e-commerce software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `boxToReload` parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
- Lack of input validation allowed malicious SQL code to be injected through the parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Although described as "Blind" SQL Injection, an attacker could still potentially extract sensitive information from the database, or modify data. The "Blind" part refers to the fact that the attacker may not directly see the results of the SQL queries, but can still infer results based on the behavior of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code into the `boxToReload` parameter via an HTTP request to `ajax.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Batavi application. This could be a remote attacker with network access to the application.
- No specific user privileges or special access to the application were mentioned as prerequisites for the attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Batavi version 1.2.1.
- The fix included improved database handling methods and a special check to strip dangerous values from user input.
- Patches are available in the `database.1.2-1.2.1.sql` and `core.1.2-1.2.1.patch` files which can be found at the provided link.
