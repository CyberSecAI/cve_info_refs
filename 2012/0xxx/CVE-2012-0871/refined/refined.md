Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure file creation by `systemd-logind` when managing user login sessions, specifically X11 display sockets.
- `systemd-logind` creates entries in `/run/user/[username]/X11/` when a user logs into an X11 desktop. The directory `/run/user/[username]` is owned by the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure File Creation:** `systemd-logind` did not create the X11 display socket entries securely. Specifically, it attempted to create a directory `X11` and a file `display` within it inside the user's runtime directory.
- **Symlink Vulnerability:** A malicious user could replace `/run/user/[username]/X11` with a symlink to a root-owned directory (e.g., `/etc/pam.d` or `/etc/cron.d`). The insecure creation of the `display` file, would then be placed into the root owned directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a local, malicious user could create a symlink named "display" in a root-owned directory, with this symlink pointing to a user controlled file (e.g. `/tmp/.X11-unix/X0`). By exploiting race conditions the attacker could then achieve a root shell.
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** The vulnerability allows for the creation of symlinks in arbitrary directories that the user does not own.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
- **Malicious User:** The attacker must be a malicious user with an account on the system.
- **Race Condition Exploitation:** Successful exploitation relies on beating race conditions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- A local user account on the system
- Ability to manipulate files in their own runtime directory `/run/user/[username]`
- Ability to exploit race conditions.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by removing the `X11/` directory and instead creating the X11 display socket directly in the user's runtime directory.
- The fix was implemented in systemd commit `fc3c1c6e091ea16ad5600b145201ec535bbb5d7c`.
- The issue was initially reported by Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team.
- The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS v2 Base Score of 6.6 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C).
