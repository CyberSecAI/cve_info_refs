| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=795853#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-21 16:28:44 UTC  ``` Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team reported that systemd-logind, a part of the systemd service and system manager, did not create certain special files in a secure way.  systemd-logind is responsible for managing and tracking user login sessions, and if a user were to log into the X11 desktop, it creates entries in /run/user/[username]/X11, where /run/user/[username] is a user-owned directory.  Because systemd-logind does not create the entries in a secure fashion, a malicious user could replace /run/user/[username]/X11 with a symlink to another root-owned directory, such as /etc/pam.d or /etc/cron.d.  This would cause a symlink named "display" to be created in the target directory, which is a symlink to a user-owned file (/tmp/.X11-unix/X0).  Using further attack vectors and this symlink, the malicious user could obtain a root shell, if he could beat two separate race conditions.   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=795853#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-21 16:42:08 UTC  ``` Sebastian indicated that the following git commit removes the X11/ directory, rendering this ineffective, although it's not known whether this fixes the flaw fully, or simply renders this one avenue ineffective.  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/commit/?id=fc3c1c6e091ea16ad5600b145201ec535bbb5d7c>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=795853#c4)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-01 09:38:36 UTC  ``` This is public now: <http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2012-02/msg00030.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=795853#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2012-03-01 12:49:17 UTC  ``` SUSE bug report:   <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=747154>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=795853#c9)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-01 18:37:31 UTC  ``` Created systemd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 799086](show_bug.cgi?id=799086 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-0871 systemd: insecure file creation may lead to elevated privileges [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=795853#c14)  Fedora Update System    2012-03-11 23:20:30 UTC  ``` systemd-37-15.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

SUSE Security Announcement
Package: systemd
Announcement ID: SUSE-SA:2012:001
Date: Wed, 29 Feb 2012 16:00:00 +0000
Affected Products: openSUSE 12.1
Vulnerability Type: local privilege escalation
CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.6 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)
SUSE Default Package: yes
Cross-References: CVE-2012-0871
Content of This Advisory:
1) Security Vulnerability Resolved:
systemd arbitrary file creation
Problem Description
2) Solution or Work-Around
3) Special Instructions and Notes
4) Package Location and Checksums
5) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:
none.
6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
systemd-logind, part of the systemd package, keeps track of user
logins and sessions. Upon login it creates dedicated files inside the
/run/user/ directory in an insecure manner. This allows local attackers
to create symlinks inside arbitrary directories.
Further exploitation steps allow local attackers to gain root access.
CVE-2012-0871 has been assigned to this issue.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no easy workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
The issue is fixed in our systemd-37-3.8.1 available in the openSUSE
12.1 update channel.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
