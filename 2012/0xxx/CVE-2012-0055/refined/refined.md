{
  "cve": "CVE-2012-0055",
  "description": "The Overlayfs filesystem was not doing the extended permission checks needed by cgroups and Linux Security Modules (LSMs). A local user could exploit this to by-pass security policy and access files that should not be accessible.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The overlayfs filesystem did not perform the necessary permission checks, specifically failing to call `devcgroup_inode_permission()` and `security_inode_permission()`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient permission checks in the overlayfs filesystem"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could bypass security policies and gain unauthorized access to files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Mounting a crafted overlayfs filesystem"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access with the ability to mount filesystems and create cgroups."
