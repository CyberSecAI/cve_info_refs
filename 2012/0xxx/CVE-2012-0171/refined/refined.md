    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from a memory corruption issue when Internet Explorer attempts to access a deleted object. Specifically, the SelectAll function is implicated.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is a remote code execution flaw due to improper handling of objects in memory within Internet Explorer's SelectAll function.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user, potentially leading to complete system compromise if the user has administrative rights. This may include installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted website designed to trigger the flaw or through compromised websites. They might also embed a malicious ActiveX control in applications or Office documents that use the IE rendering engine. Users would need to be convinced to visit the malicious site or open the malicious document, typically via links in emails or instant messages.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attackers need the capability to host or deliver specially crafted HTML content that exploits the vulnerability. They also need to convince the victim to access the malicious content through social engineering techniques."
