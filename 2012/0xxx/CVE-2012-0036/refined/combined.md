# cURL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in cURL, the worst of
which might allow remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/curl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.24.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.24.0** |

### Background

cURL is a command line tool for transferring files with URL syntax,
supporting numerous protocols.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in cURL:

* When zlib is enabled, the amount of data sent to an application for
  automatic decompression is not restricted (CVE-2010-0734).
* When performing GSSAPI authentication, credential delegation is
  always used (CVE-2011-2192).
* When SSL is enabled, cURL improperly disables the OpenSSL workaround
  to mitigate an information disclosure vulnerability in the SSL and TLS
  protocols (CVE-2011-3389).
* libcurl does not properly verify file paths for escape control
  characters in IMAP, POP3 or SMTP URLs (CVE-2012-0036).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated process to open a
specially crafted file or URL using cURL, possibly resulting in the
remote execution of arbitrary code, a Denial of Service condition,
disclosure of sensitive information, or unwanted actions performed via
the IMAP, POP3 or SMTP protocols. Furthermore, remote servers may be able
to impersonate clients via GSSAPI requests.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All cURL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/curl-7.24.0"

```

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Ollie Rutherfurd    2002-01-24 07:18:21 UTC  ``` Hi,  When I initially merged galeon, it segfaulted when starting.  Based on the warnings dumped to the console prior to the segfault, I merged media-libs/gdk-pixbug, and now it works.  -Ollie ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-24 07:36:07 UTC  ``` I think this is the same as #286 (that gdk-pixbuf was actually already merged but didn't have support for png). I'm adding a dep on the fixed version of gdk-pixbuf.  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [286](show_bug.cgi?id=286 "RESOLVED FIXED - Galeon depends on gdk-pixbuf being built with png support") *** ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=773457#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-11 21:22:38 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way that curl sanitized URLs.  The upstream advisory [1] reports:     libcurl is vulnerable to a data injection attack for certain protocols    through control characters embedded or percent-encoded in URLs.     When parsing URLs, libcurl's parser is very laxed and liberal and only    parses as little as possible and lets as much as possible through as long as    it can figure out what to do.     In the specific process when libcurl extracts the file path part from a    given URL, it didn't always verify the data or escape control characters    properly before it passed the file path on to the protocol-specific code    that then would use it for its protocol business.     This passing through of control characters could be exploited by someone who    would be able to pass in a handicrafted URL to libcurl. Lots of libcurl    using applications let users enter URLs in one form or another and not all    of these check the input carefully to prevent malicious ones.     A malicious user might pass in %0d%0a to get treated as CR LF by libcurl,    and by using this fact a user can trick for example a POP3 client to delete    a message instead of getting it or trick an SMTP server to send an    unintended message.     This vulnerability can be used to fool libcurl with the following protocols:    IMAP, POP3 and SMTP.                                                                                                                                                                                     There is no known exploit for this problem.   This flaw only affects curl versions 7.20.0 up to and including 7.23.1  It is corrected in 7.24.0 by scanning for a range of "bad codes" in the path part of URLs so that they are rejected before any protocol code even can consider using them.  This flaw has been assigned the name [CVE-2012-0036](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0036).  [1] <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html>  Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 or 6.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=773457#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-11 21:28:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 552243](attachment.cgi?id=552243&action=diff "proposed upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=552243&action=edit "proposed upstream patch") proposed upstream patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=773457#c3)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-20 23:19:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 556625](attachment.cgi?id=556625&action=diff "proposed upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=556625&action=edit "proposed upstream patch") proposed upstream patch  Updated version of upstream's patch.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=773457#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-01-24 09:37:38 UTC  ``` Upstream security page describing this issue: [2] <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html>  Particular [CVE-2012-0036](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0036) dedicated advisory from upstream: [3] <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html>  Final version of upstream patch: [4] <http://curl.haxx.se/curl-url-sanitize.patch>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=773457#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-01-24 10:56:05 UTC  ``` Created mingw32-curl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 784227](show_bug.cgi?id=784227 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-0036 curl: URL sanitization vulnerability [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 784228](show_bug.cgi?id=784228 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-0036 curl: URL sanitization vulnerability [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=773457#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-01-24 10:56:09 UTC  ``` Created curl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 784226](show_bug.cgi?id=784226 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-0036 curl: URL sanitization vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=773457#c7)  Kamil Dudka    2012-01-24 12:03:00 UTC  ``` upstream commit:  <https://github.com/bagder/curl/commit/75ca568>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=773457#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-01-25 09:13:13 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting this issue.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 193 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/).

**Please note that on May 15, 2015, Oracle released  [Security Alert for CVE-2015-3456 (QEMU "Venom")](/security-alerts/cve-2015-3456.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-3456.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in previous [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Fusion Middleware

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 39 new security fixes for Oracle Fusion Middleware. 36 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html#FMW).

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security fixes are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2015 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2015 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products,[My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1)

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

URL sanitize: reject URLs containing bad data

[Browse files](/curl/curl/tree/75ca568fa1c19de4c5358fed246686de8467c238)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
Protocols (IMAP, POP3 and SMTP) that use the path part of a URL in a
decoded manner now use the new Curl_urldecode() function to reject URLs
with embedded control codes (anything that is or decodes to a byte value
less than 32).

URLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and
allow users to do unintended actions with otherwise innocent tools and
applications. Like for example using a URL like
pop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get
a mail and instead this would delete one.

This flaw is considered a security vulnerability: [CVE-2012-0036](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xxw5-p895-cp2c "CVE-2012-0036")

Security advisory at: <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html>
