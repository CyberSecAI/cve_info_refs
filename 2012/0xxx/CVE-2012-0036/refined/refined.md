  "CVE-2012-0036": {
    "description": "curl and libcurl 7.2x before 7.24.0 do not properly consider special characters during extraction of a pathname from a URL, which allows remote attackers to conduct data-injection attacks via a crafted URL, as demonstrated by a CRLF injection attack on the (1) IMAP, (2) POP3, or (3) SMTP protocol.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of URLs by libcurl when extracting the file path, allowing control characters to be passed to protocol-specific code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Data injection vulnerability due to insufficient validation of URL path characters.",
         "Improper handling of escape control characters in IMAP, POP3, and SMTP URLs."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can inject data into protocols (IMAP, POP3, SMTP) via crafted URLs, potentially leading to remote code execution, denial of service, disclosure of sensitive information or unwanted actions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted URLs with embedded or percent-encoded control characters.",
         "Specially crafted files or URLs opened by curl."
