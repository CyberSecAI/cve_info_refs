How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.9 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 5.9 |

Repeated attempts to exploit this vulnerability could result in a sustained denial of service (DoS) condition.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following products are affected by this vulnerability: + Cisco IOS Software   + Cisco IOS XE Software To determine whether a Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.      The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M: ```   Router#show version   Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)   Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport   Copyright (c) 1986-2008 by Cisco Systems, Inc.   Compiled Thu 10-Jul-08 20:25 by prod_rel_team   ``` Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in the White Paper: [Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html)Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability. No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * MSDP is the protocol used to connect multiple Protocol Independent Multicast sparse mode (PIM-SM) domains. MSDP allows multicast sources for a group to be known to all rendezvous points (RPs) in different domains. An RP runs MSDP over TCP to discover multicast sources.      An RP in a PIM-SM domain has an MSDP peering relationship with MSDP-enabled routers in another domain. The peering relationship occurs over a TCP connection, where primarily a list of sources sending to multicast groups is exchanged. The TCP connections between RPs are achieved by the underlying routing system. The receiving RP uses the source lists to establish a source path.      The purpose of this topology is to have domains discover multicast sources in other domains. If the multicast sources are of interest to a domain that has receivers, multicast data is delivered over the normal, source-tree building mechanism in PIM-SM.      An MSDP packet containing encapsulated Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) data, received from an external MSDP-configured peer router, can cause an affected device to reload. This vulnerability can only be exploited if the router is explicitly joined to the multicast group. The MSDP packet destination address is a unicast address and can be addressed to any IP address on the affected device, including loopback addresses.      Transit traffic will not trigger this vulnerability.      A vulnerable interface configuration contains an explicitly joined multicast group. Some example configurations that permit exploitation of this vulnerability are:         !--- Interface configured for SAP Listener Support (a common multicast group)   ```   interface GigabitEthernet0/0   ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0   ip pim sparse-mode   ip sap listen   ```      !--- Interface configured to join a multicast group    ```    interface GigabitEthernet0/0   ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0   ip pim sparse-mode   ip igmp join-group 224.2.127.254    ```      You can also use the **show igmp interface** command to determine if an interface is joined to a multicast group.    ```      ```   RouterA#show ip igmp interface GigabitEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up  Internet address is 192.168.0.1/24  IGMP is enabled on interface  Current IGMP host version is 2  Current IGMP router version is 2  IGMP query interval is 60 seconds  IGMP querier timeout is 120 seconds  IGMP max query response time is 10 seconds  Last member query count is 2  Last member query response interval is 1000 ms  Inbound IGMP access group is not set  IGMP activity: 2 joins, 0 leaves  Multicast routing is disabled on interface  Multicast TTL threshold is 0  Multicast groups joined by this system (number of users):      224.2.127.254(2)  239.255.255.255(1)   ```      ```  This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtr28857](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr28857) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).   This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and   Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-0382.  Workarounds  * Customers with an MSDP-configured router who do not require membership to multicast groups can remove the **ip sap listen** or **ip igmp join-group <*multicast-group address*>** commands on the router interface as a workaround.  For example:    ```     RouterA#conf t    RouterA(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0    RouterA(config-if)# no ip sap listen    RouterA(config-if)# no ip igmp join-group 224.2.127.254         ```   ```     interface GigabitEthernet0/0  ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0  ip pim sparse-mode    ```    To determine if a router is configured for MSDP peers, run the command **show ip msdp peer** at the router command prompt:    ```   RouterA# show ip msdp peerMSDP Peer 192.168.0.2 (?), AS 100  Connection status:    State: Up, Resets: 0, Connection source: none configured    Uptime(Downtime): 01:23:42, Messages sent/received: 25/24    Output messages discarded: 0    Connection and counters cleared 01:15:14 ago  SA Filtering:    Input (S,G) filter: none, route-map: none    Input RP filter: none, route-map: none    Output (S,G) filter: none, route-map: none    Output RP filter: none, route-map: none  SA-Requests:    Input filter: none  Peer ttl threshold: 0  SAs learned from this peer: 0    Input queue size: 0, Output queue size: 0  Message counters:    RPF Failure count: 0    SA Messages in/out: 13/8    SA Requests in: 0    SA Responses out: 0        Data Packets in/out: 7/8   ``` To remove an untrusted MSDP peer from your configuration, use the **no ip msdp peer <*address*>** or **ip msdp default-peer <*ip-address* | *name*>**    command on the router configuration interface.      RouterA(config)# **no ip msdp peer 192.168.0.2** ```   interface GigabitEthernet0/0 ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0 ip pim sparse-mode       ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
