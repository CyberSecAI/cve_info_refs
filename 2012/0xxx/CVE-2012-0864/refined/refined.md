  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-0864",
    "description": "An integer overflow flaw was found in the implementation of the printf functions family. This could allow an attacker to bypass FORTIFY_SOURCE protections and execute arbitrary code using a format string flaw in an application, even though these protections are expected to limit the impact of such flaws to an application abort.",
    "affected_software": [
      "glibc"
    ],
    "root_cause": "An integer overflow in the 'nargs' variable used in `vfprintf`, which calculates the number of arguments, leading to heap-based buffer overflows and bypassing FORTIFY_SOURCE protections",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow",
       "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Format string vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted format strings"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to control format string in vulnerable applications."
