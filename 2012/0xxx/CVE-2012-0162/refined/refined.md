  "CVE-2012-0162": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft .NET Framework that can allow a specially crafted Microsoft .NET Framework application to access memory in an unsafe manner.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Microsoft .NET Framework improperly allocates a buffer in memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper buffer allocation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web browsing attack scenario: An attacker could host a website with a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) to exploit this vulnerability, convincing the user to view the website.",
        "Windows .NET applications attack scenario: Vulnerability could be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to convince a user to visit a malicious website or run a specially crafted Windows .NET application. For the web scenario, social engineering is necessary. For local attacks, the attacker would need valid credentials on the system. "
