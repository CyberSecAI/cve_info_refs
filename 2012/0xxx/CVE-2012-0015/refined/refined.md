Based on the provided documents, here's the extracted information related to CVE-2012-0015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft .NET Framework improperly calculating a buffer length while processing specially crafted input. This can lead to a heap corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Heap corruption vulnerability in .NET Framework due to improper buffer length calculation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights. The attacker gains the same permissions as the user running the application or service.
- **Web Hosting Scenario:** An attacker could potentially take control over other application pools on the web server or be able to take complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Browsing Scenario:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted website containing a malicious XAML Browser Application (XBAP). The user is tricked into visiting the website. Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content can also be used.
- **Web Hosting Scenario:** If a web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker can upload a malicious application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Windows .NET Applications:** Windows .NET applications can use the vulnerability to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Web Browsing:** The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website and convince a user to visit it or to compromise a website already visited by the victim.
- **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs to have the ability to upload and run custom ASP.NET applications on a webserver.
- **Windows .NET Application:** The attacker needs the ability to run a malicious Windows .NET application on the target system.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, .NET Framework 3.5.1, and .NET Framework 4.0.
- The vulnerability is rated "Critical".
- Microsoft was aware of public disclosure of the vulnerability at the time of the security bulletin's release, but hadn't received reports of it being exploited in the wild.
- Microsoft recommends applying the provided security updates immediately.
- Workarounds include disabling XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer.
