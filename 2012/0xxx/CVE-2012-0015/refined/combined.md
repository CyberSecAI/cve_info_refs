# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-016 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2651026)

Published: February 14, 2012 | Updated: July 10, 2012

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution on a client system if a user views a specially crafted web page using a web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs) or Silverlight applications. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4 on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows; and for Microsoft Silverlight 4. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the manner in which Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight use unmanaged objects. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

This is a detection change only. There were no changes to the security update files. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to take any action.

**Are Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5** **on Windows** **Developer Preview** **and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 Developer Preview** **affected by this vulnerability?**

Yes. This vulnerability was reported after the release of the Windows Developer Preview and the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 Developer Preview. Customers running the Developer Preview software are encouraged to download and apply the update to their systems. For more information, including Microsoft Download Center links, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles:

| Affected Software | Microsoft Knowledge Base Article |

| Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 on Windows Developer Preview | [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2633869](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2633869) |
| Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 Developer Preview on Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 | [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2638804](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2638804) |

Security updates are available from [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) and [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912.aspx).

**Which web browsers support Microsoft Silverlight applications?**

In order to run Microsoft Silverlight applications, most web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, require Microsoft Silverlight to be installed and the corresponding plug-in to be enabled. For more information about Microsoft Silverlight, see the official site, [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/). Please refer to the documentation of your browser to learn more about how to disable or remove plug-ins.

**What versions of Microsoft Silverlight 4 are affected by the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Silverlight build 4.1.10111, which is the current build of Microsoft Silverlight as of when this bulletin was first released, addresses the vulnerability and is not affected. Builds of Microsoft Silverlight previous to 4.1.10111 are affected.

**How do I know which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight is currently installed?**

If Microsoft Silverlight is already installed on your computer, you can visit the [Get Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/get-started/install/) page, which will indicate which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight are currently installed on your system. Alternatively, you can use the Manage Add-Ons feature of current versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer to determine the version and build information that is currently installed.

You can also manually check the version number of sllauncher.exe located in the "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Silverlight" directory (on x86 Microsoft Windows systems) or in the "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Silverlight" directory (on x64 Microsoft Windows systems).

In addition, on Microsoft Windows, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found in the registry at [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x86 Microsoft Windows systems, or [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x64 Microsoft Windows systems.

On Apple Mac OS, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found as follows:

1. Open the **Finder**
2. Select the system drive and go to the folder **Internet Plug-ins - Library**
3. Right-click the file **Silverlight.Plugin** (if your mouse has only one button, press the **Ctrl** key while clicking on the file) to bring up the context menu, then click **Show Package Contents**
4. Inside the contents folder, locate the file **info.plist** and open it with an editor. It will contain an entry like this, which shows you the version number:
   SilverlightVersion
   4.1.10111

The version installed with this security update is 4.1.10111. If your version number is higher than or equal to this version number, your system is not vulnerable.

**How do I upgrade my version of Microsoft Silverlight?**

The Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature helps makes sure that your Microsoft Silverlight installation is kept up to date with the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight, Microsoft Silverlight functionality, and security features. For more information about the Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature, see the [Microsoft Silverlight Updater](https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/resources/documentation/updater.aspx). Customers who have disabled the Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature can enroll in [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) to obtain the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight, or download the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight manually using the download link in the Affected Software table in the earlier section, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**. For information about deploying Microsoft Silverlight in an enterprise environment, see the [Silverlight Enterprise Deployment Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=119611).

**I have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed; this version is not listed among the affected software in this bulletin. Do I need to install an update?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer. The .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installer chains in the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup, so installing the former also installs the latter. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed. Do I need to install any updates?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer. The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installer chains in both the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup and the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 setup. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

## .NET Framework Unmanaged Objects Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0014

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft .NET Framework and Silverlight that can allow a specially crafted Microsoft .NET Framework application to access memory in an unsafe manner. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-0014](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-0014).

#### Mitigating Factors for .NET Framework Unmanaged Objects Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0014

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability only on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and only in a web browsing attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about [Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039).
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user or the user account of ASP.NET. Users or accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users or accounts that operate with administrative user rights.
* In a web-hosting scenario, an attacker must have permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a website and ASP.NET must be installed on that web server. In default configuration, an anonymous user cannot upload and run Microsoft .NET code on an Internet Information Server (IIS).
* By default, partial trust ASP.NET applications are not granted SocketPermission. As a consequence, in a server-side scenario, this vulnerability can not be exploited in ASP.NET applications with a trust level of medium or lower unless those applications are explicitly granted SocketPermission by the administrator. For more information about ASP.NET trust levels, see the MSDN article [ASP.NET Trust Levels and Policy Files](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/wyts434y.aspx).

#### Workarounds for .NET Framework Unmanaged Objects Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0014

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  3. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XAML browser applications**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XPS documents**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. On the **Security** tab, click **Custom level**. Under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, set **Run components not signed with Authenticode** to either **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu, and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Reset all zones to default level**, and then click **OK**.
* **Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer (Method 1)**

  You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by temporarily preventing attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  We recommend that you back up the registry before you edit it.

  Use the following text to create a .reg file that temporarily prevents attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer. You can copy the following text, paste it into a text editor such as Notepad, and then save the file with the .reg file name extension. Run the .reg file on the vulnerable client.

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{DFEAF541-F3E1-4C24-ACAC-99C30715084A}]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  ```

  Close Internet Explorer and reopen it for the changes to take effect.

  For detailed steps about stopping a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps and create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Applications and Web sites that require the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control may no longer function correctly. If you implement this workaround it would affect any Silverlight ActiveX control you have installed on your system.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Remove the registry keys added to temporarily prevent attempts to instantiate the Silverlight ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.
* **Temporarily prevent the Microsoft Silverlight ActiveX control from running in Firefox or Chrome**

  To modify the registry key to disable Microsoft Silverlight, follow these steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

#### FAQ for .NET Framework Unmanaged Objects Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0014

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight improperly use unmanaged objects.

**What is Microsoft Silverlight?**

Microsoft Silverlight is a cross-browser, cross-platform implementation of the Microsoft .NET Framework for building media experiences and rich interactive applications for the web. For more information, see the official site of [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In the web browsing scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In the web hosting scenario, an attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the service account associated with the application pool identity of the application pool in which a Microsoft .NET application is running. Depending on application pool isolation configuration and permissions granted to the service account, an attacker might be able to take control over other application pools on the web server or be able to take complete control of the affected system. For more information about application pool identities and configuration, see the TechNet article, [Configure Application Pool Identity](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc781986%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are three attack scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability: a web browsing scenario, a web hosting scenario, and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions. These scenarios are described as follows:

* **Web browsing attack scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.
* **Web hosting attack scenario**

  If a web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the sandbox used to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.
* **Windows .NET applications attack scenario**

  This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a web application and a rich-client application. Like web applications, XBAPs can be published to a web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What are .NET Framework Code Access Security (CAS) Restrictions?**

The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security. Code access security (CAS) enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity. Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run. Using code access security can reduce the likelihood that your code will be misused by malicious or error-filled code. For more information on CAS, see the MSDN article, [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are three types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described as follows: systems that are using the web browsing scenario, systems that are using the web hosting scenario, and systems that are using the Windows .NET applications scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.
* **Windows .NET applications**

  Workstations and server that run untrusted Windows .NET applications are also at risk from this vulnerability.

## .NET Framework Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0015

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft .NET Framework due to it improperly calculating a buffer length while processing specially crafted input. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-0015](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-0015).

#### Mitigating Factors for .NET Framework Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0015

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability only on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and only in a web browsing attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about [Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039).
* In a web-hosting scenario, an attacker must have permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a website and ASP.NET must be installed on that web server. In default configuration, an anonymous user cannot upload and run Microsoft .NET code on an Internet Information Server (IIS).

#### Workarounds for .NET Framework Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0015

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  3. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XAML browser applications**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XPS documents**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. On the **Security** tab, click **Custom level**. Under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, set **Run components not signed with Authenticode** to either **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu, and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Reset all zones to default level**, and then click **OK**.

#### FAQ for .NET Framework Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0015

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework improperly calculates a buffer length while processing specially crafted input.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In the web browsing scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In the web hosting scenario, an attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the service account associated with the application pool identity of the application pool in which a Microsoft .NET application is running. Depending on application pool isolation configuration and permissions granted to the service account, an attacker might be able to take control over other application pools on the web server or be able to take complete control of the affected system. For more information about application pool identities and configuration, see the TechNet article, [Configure Application Pool Identity](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc781986%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are three attack scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability: a web browsing scenario, a web hosting scenario, and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions scenario. These scenarios are described as follows:

* **Web browsing attack scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.
* **Web hosting attack scenario**

  If a web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the sandbox used to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.
* **Windows .NET applications attack scenario**

  This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a web application and a rich-client application. Like web applications, XBAPs can be published to a web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What are .NET Framework Code Access Security (CAS) Restrictions?**

The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security. Code access security (CAS) enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity. Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run. Using code access security can reduce the likelihood that your code will be misused by malicious or error-filled code. For more information on CAS, see the MSDN article, [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are three types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described as follows: systems that are using the web browsing scenario, systems that are using the web hosting scenario, and systems that are using the Windows .NET applications scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.
* **Windows .NET applications**

  Workstations and server that run untrusted Windows .NET applications are also at risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft .NET Framework calculates buffer lengths.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2012-0015](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-0015).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

**Verifying That** **the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
