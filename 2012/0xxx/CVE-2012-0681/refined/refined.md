- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When connecting to a third-party VNC server with "Encrypt all network data" enabled, the data was not being encrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of encryption when "Encrypt all network data" was enabled for third-party VNC connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure due to unencrypted network data.
- **Attack vectors**: Connecting to a third-party VNC server with the specified setting enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to initiate a connection to a third-party VNC server using Apple Remote Desktop 3.6.1 with "Encrypt all network data" enabled.
