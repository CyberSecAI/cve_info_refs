Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0796:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data when constructing email headers. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the email headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Email Header Injection:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or validate data that is used in the construction of email headers. This permits an attacker to include additional headers or modify existing ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Header Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious header information. This may include:
    *   **Bypassing Email Filtering:** Adding or modifying recipients, which can lead to emails being sent to unintended recipients or bypassing filters.
    *   **Spoofing:** Modifying the "From" address or other headers to make emails appear as if they are from a different source.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by user-provided input that is not properly sanitized and is used in email headers. This could be done through various forms of user input within the application, such as profile information, forum posts, or other data fields that could be included in email notifications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a Moodle Instance:** An attacker would require access to a Moodle instance with the vulnerability present.
*   **Ability to trigger email:** The attacker must be able to perform actions that cause the system to send an email where attacker-controlled data is used in header construction.
*   **User Privileges:**  The attacker would likely need user-level privileges or, in some cases, be a guest user in a system that permits sending notifications.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Simon Coggins.
*   This vulnerability affects Moodle versions: 2.2, 2.1 to 2.1.3+, 2.0 to 2.0.6+, 1.9 to 1.9.15+.
*   The fix involves sanitizing data before using it to create email headers.
