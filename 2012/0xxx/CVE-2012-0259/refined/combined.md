How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-29 10:02:49 UTC  ``` An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way ImageMagick, an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window System, retrieved Exchangeable image file format (Exif) header tag information from certain JPEG files. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image file, with EXIF header containing specially-crafted tag values, which once opened in some ImageMagick tool would lead to the crash of that tool (denial of service).  Upstream patch: [1] <http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20629>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:03:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting this issue. CERT-FI acknowledges Aleksis Kauppinen, Joonas Kuorilehto, Tuomas Parttimaa and Lasse Ylivainio of Codenomicon's CROSS project as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:29:28 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the ImageMagick package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:41:18 UTC  ``` Public now via: [2] <http://www.cert.fi/en/reports/2012/vulnerability635606.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:43:20 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 808159](show_bug.cgi?id=808159 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-0259 CVE-2012-0260 CVE-2012-1798 ImageMagick various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c5)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-30 11:58:23 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the ImageMagick package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c6)  Olivier Fourdan    2012-04-02 15:23:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 574539](attachment.cgi?id=574539&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=574539&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  Updated patch, this one also adds a test to avoid an overflow of the "number_bytes" value when the "components" field is too large.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c7)  Olivier Fourdan    2012-04-03 09:57:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 574809](attachment.cgi?id=574809&action=diff "Updated (clean up) patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=574809&action=edit "Updated (clean up) patch") Updated (clean up) patch  Same proposed patch, without the traces.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c8)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-04-10 14:53:09 UTC  ``` The original patch for [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259) is insufficient. Upstream was notified and a new patch was published on [1]. As announced in [2], [CVE-2012-1610](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1610) has been assigned to the insufficient fix of [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259).  [1] <http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20629#p82865> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/04/6>   Statement CVE-2012-1610:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of ImageMagick as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as it did not backport the insufficient patch for [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c9)  Pavel Alexeev    2012-04-11 13:28:58 UTC  ``` Rawhide build which should fix it <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=3977291>.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:51:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0544 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0544.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c11)  Fedora Update System    2012-06-22 08:36:08 UTC  ``` ImageMagick-6.7.0.10-5.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

Concerning ImageMagick 6.7.6-2 and earlier:

* [CVE-2012-0259] JPEG EXIF tag crash.
* [CVE-2012-0260] Excessive memory use with JPEG restart markers.
* [CVE-2012-1798] Copying of invalid memory when reading TIFF EXIF IFD.

Thanks goes to Aleksis Kauppinen, Joonas Kuorilehto and Tuomas Parttimaa of the Codenomicon CROSS project for discovering the vulnerabilities and providing a test case file. And thanks to the Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority (CERT-FI) for alerting us to these vulnerabilities

These patches are included in the ImageMagick 6.7.6-3 release. For earlier releases, here are the patches to repair these vulnerabilities:

Hi

What are the dangers of not implementing this patch?

It is only dangerous if the images ImageMagick processes come from some unknown source, such as a typical user on the web.

The above basically basically says they crash the system. When means some limit check or input verification failed, somewhere.

However if some 'cracker' does a lot of work (much of it guess work) and know the exact version of IM you are using, they 'may' be able to use that failure to get IM to execute some other, user provided code. Code that could for example run a program to open a command line into the web server computer IM is running on.

Note that is it unlikely someone would spend that much effort for access to just one computer. It would be 'pay'. Such effort is more likely in a more common system, such as a well know web server, wiki (Apache), forum application (like this one), OS (AKA microsoft windows), and so on. So if you app become popular, THEN you may have a problem.

It is always better however to know about a potential problem, such as what is being reported by these security teams, and have it fixed, than leave it. Program bugs like these are easy to lose, even by the program who has intimate knowledge of the code working, and thus what is causing the problem. In fact there is a 'logic' proof that basically says that it is impossible to prove a program is bug free. As such all that we can do is make any actual bug as rare as we can.

Anthony: It's not that unlikely that a cyber warrior would be focused on a particular target.

Or that a "cracker" attempting to escalate his or her priviledges on a particular

machine.

Tama: If you are talking about your own computer, don't have any untrusted users on

it[1], and you aren't processing images from untrusted sources, then there is little danger,

but I'd try to fix any known vulnerabilities right away anyhow.

[1] You can't be sure you don't have untrusted users if your system is connected to

the net; they might have cracked your system and opened a back door!

Does it cause segmentation faults as well?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=807994#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-29 10:05:53 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick, an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window System, decoded certain JPEG images. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image with specially-crafted values / sequences of RST0 up to RST7 restart markers (used to indicate the input stream to be corrupted), which once processed by some ImageMagick tool would lead that tool to consume excessive amount of CPU time (denial of service).

## Topic

Updated ImageMagick packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

ImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
System that can read and write multiple image formats.

A flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed images with malformed
Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted image file that, when opened by a victim, would cause
ImageMagick to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-0247)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed images
with malformed Exif metadata. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
image file that, when opened by a victim, could cause ImageMagick to enter
an infinite loop. (CVE-2012-0248)

It was found that ImageMagick utilities tried to load ImageMagick
configuration files from the current working directory. If a user ran an
ImageMagick utility in an attacker-controlled directory containing a
specially-crafted ImageMagick configuration file, it could cause the
utility to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-4167)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed
certain Exif tags with a large components count. An attacker could create
a specially-crafted image file that, when opened by a victim, could cause
ImageMagick to access invalid memory and crash. (CVE-2012-0259)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick decoded certain
JPEG images. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image with
specially-crafted sequences of RST0 up to RST7 restart markers (used to
indicate the input stream to be corrupted), which once processed by
ImageMagick, would cause it to consume excessive amounts of memory and CPU
time. (CVE-2012-0260)

An out-of-bounds buffer read flaw was found in the way ImageMagick
processed certain TIFF image files. A remote attacker could provide a TIFF
image with a specially-crafted Exif IFD value (the set of tags for
recording Exif-specific attribute information), which once opened by
ImageMagick, would cause it to crash. (CVE-2012-1798)

Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting CVE-2012-0259,
CVE-2012-0260, and CVE-2012-1798. CERT-FI acknowledges Aleksis Kauppinen,
Joonas Kuorilehto, Tuomas Parttimaa and Lasse Ylivainio of Codenomicon's
CROSS project as the original reporters.

Users of ImageMagick are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-29 10:02:49 UTC  ``` An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way ImageMagick, an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window System, retrieved Exchangeable image file format (Exif) header tag information from certain JPEG files. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image file, with EXIF header containing specially-crafted tag values, which once opened in some ImageMagick tool would lead to the crash of that tool (denial of service).  Upstream patch: [1] <http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20629>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:03:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting this issue. CERT-FI acknowledges Aleksis Kauppinen, Joonas Kuorilehto, Tuomas Parttimaa and Lasse Ylivainio of Codenomicon's CROSS project as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:29:28 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the ImageMagick package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:41:18 UTC  ``` Public now via: [2] <http://www.cert.fi/en/reports/2012/vulnerability635606.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:43:20 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 808159](show_bug.cgi?id=808159 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-0259 CVE-2012-0260 CVE-2012-1798 ImageMagick various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c5)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-30 11:58:23 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the ImageMagick package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c6)  Olivier Fourdan    2012-04-02 15:23:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 574539](attachment.cgi?id=574539&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=574539&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  Updated patch, this one also adds a test to avoid an overflow of the "number_bytes" value when the "components" field is too large.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c7)  Olivier Fourdan    2012-04-03 09:57:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 574809](attachment.cgi?id=574809&action=diff "Updated (clean up) patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=574809&action=edit "Updated (clean up) patch") Updated (clean up) patch  Same proposed patch, without the traces.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c8)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-04-10 14:53:09 UTC  ``` The original patch for [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259) is insufficient. Upstream was notified and a new patch was published on [1]. As announced in [2], [CVE-2012-1610](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1610) has been assigned to the insufficient fix of [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259).  [1] <http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20629#p82865> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/04/6>   Statement CVE-2012-1610:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of ImageMagick as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as it did not backport the insufficient patch for [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c9)  Pavel Alexeev    2012-04-11 13:28:58 UTC  ``` Rawhide build which should fix it <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=3977291>.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:51:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0544 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0544.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c11)  Fedora Update System    2012-06-22 08:36:08 UTC  ``` ImageMagick-6.7.0.10-5.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.
