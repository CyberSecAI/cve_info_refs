  "CVE-2012-0259": {
    "description": "An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way ImageMagick, an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window System, retrieved Exchangeable image file format (Exif) header tag information from certain JPEG files. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image file, with EXIF header containing specially-crafted tag values, which once opened in some ImageMagick tool would lead to the crash of that tool (denial of service).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Out-of heap-based buffer read in ImageMagick when processing crafted JPEG EXIF header tag values.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of EXIF data leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
        "Lack of sufficient input validation.",
	"Integer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attack via a crafted JPEG image with malicious EXIF data."
      ],
	"attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to create a specially crafted JPEG image with a malicious EXIF header"
