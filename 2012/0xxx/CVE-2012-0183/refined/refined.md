Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted Rich Text Format (RTF) data. Specifically, the parsing process can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **RTF Parsing Error:** Improper handling of RTF data, leading to memory corruption when parsing maliciously crafted files. This memory corruption can be exploited to achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, an attacker could gain complete control of the system, including:
    - Installing programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creating new accounts with full user rights
- Users with fewer rights are less impacted but still vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:**
    - Sending a specially crafted RTF email message that is previewed or opened using Microsoft Word as the email viewer.
    - Sending a specially crafted RTF file as an email attachment and convincing the user to open it.
- **Web-based attacks:**
    - Hosting a malicious RTF file on a website.
    - Utilizing compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content to host malicious RTF files.
    - Tricking users into visiting the attacker's website and opening the malicious RTF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious RTF Files:** An attacker needs to create RTF files that exploit the vulnerability.
- **Delivery Mechanism:**
    - For email attacks, the attacker needs to be able to send emails.
    - For web-based attacks, the attacker needs to host the malicious RTF file on a reachable web server.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open or preview the malicious RTF file. This could be achieved via:
    - Social engineering through emails with malicious attachments.
    - Tricking users into visiting a malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Microsoft Word (2003, 2007) as well as Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack and Microsoft Office for Mac 2008 and 2011.
- Microsoft has released security updates to address this vulnerability.
- Workarounds such as reading emails in plain text, and using the Microsoft Office File Block policy to block RTF files from untrusted sources, were provided.

This information provides a detailed understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the methods an attacker could use to exploit it.
