Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities addressed by the Movable Type 5.13, 5.07, and 4.38 security updates, which are related to CVE-2012-0318:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** Vulnerability exists in the file management system due to insufficient input validation or sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Session Hijack and CSRF:**  The commenting and community scripts are vulnerable to session hijacking and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, which might lead to unauthorized actions or script execution in the victim's browser.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Templates do not properly escape variables, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   `mt-wizard.cgi` is also vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** Allows execution of arbitrary system commands.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Enables attackers to take over user sessions.
*   **CSRF:** Enables attackers to perform actions on behalf of logged-in users without their consent.
*   **XSS:** Allows injection of malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **OS Command Injection:**  Complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service via arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   **Session Hijack and CSRF:** Unauthorized access to user accounts, manipulation of user data, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **XSS:** Script injection can lead to user data theft, session hijacking, defacement of websites, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** Exploited by users with permission to sign into the admin script and upload files.
*   **Session Hijack and CSRF:** Exploited remotely through the commenting and community scripts.
*   **XSS:** Exploited by injecting malicious scripts via templates or through `mt-wizard.cgi`, affecting users who view affected pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **OS Command Injection:** Requires a user account with permissions to log in to the admin script and upload files.
*   **Session Hijack and CSRF:** Requires remote access and some user interaction in certain circumstances.
*   **XSS:** Remote attacker can inject the scripts. The attacker does not need direct access to the Movable Type server, but needs to inject malicious content which will be executed by the user's browser when they access a vulnerable page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The OS Command Injection vulnerability is considered the most serious.
*   The XSS vulnerability in `mt-wizard.cgi` was reported by Trustwave (TWSL2012-003).
*   The update also disables the `mt:Include file="XXX"` attribute by default to prevent arbitrary file access through templates, adds more extensions to `DeniedAssetFileExtensions` configuration directive (pm, so, rb, htc)
*   Movable Type versions 5.12, 5.06, 4.37, 4.292 and earlier are affected.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Movable Type versions 5.13, 5.07, and 4.38.
