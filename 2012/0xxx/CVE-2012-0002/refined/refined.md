{
  "CVE-2012-0002": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Remote Desktop Protocol accesses an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on the target system.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of a sequence of specially crafted RDP packets leads to accessing an object in memory that has been improperly initialized or deleted.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory handling",
      "Lack of proper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a sequence of specially crafted RDP packets to the target system."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a sequence of specially crafted RDP packets. For systems without NLA, no prior authentication is needed. With NLA, the attacker must first authenticate to Remote Desktop Services using a valid account on the target system.",
    "Additional Details": [
      "The vulnerability affects various Windows versions, including Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, and Server 2008 R2.",
      "Systems that do not have RDP enabled are not at risk from the vulnerability.",
        "Enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA) reduces the risk as it requires the attacker to authenticate before exploiting the vulnerability.",
        "The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Remote Desktop Protocol processes packets in memory.",
        "Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure and there were no reports of exploitation at the time of the bulletin release"
    ]
