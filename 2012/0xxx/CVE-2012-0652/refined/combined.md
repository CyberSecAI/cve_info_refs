  CVE-2012-0662 : aazubel working with HP's Zero Day Initiative

* **Time Machine**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7 to v10.7.3, OS X Lion Server v10.7 to v10.7.3

  Impact: A remote attacker may access a user's Time Machine backup credentials

  Description: The user may designate a Time Capsule or remote AFP volume attached to an AirPort Base Station to be used for Time Machine backups. Beginning with AirPort Base Station and Time Capsule Firmware Update 7.6, Time Capsules and Base Stations support a secure SRP-based authentication mechanism over AFP. However, Time Machine did not require that the SRP-based authentication mechanism was used for subsequent backup operations, even if Time Machine was initially configured or had ever contacted a Time Capsule or Base Station that supported it. An attacker who is able to spoof the remote volume could gain access to user's Time Capsule credentials, although not backup data, sent by the user's system. This issue is addressed by requiring use of the SRP-based authentication mechanism if the backup destination has ever supported it.
