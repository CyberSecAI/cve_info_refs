Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the logging of sensitive user password information within the system logs during network account logins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Sensitive information exposure: User passwords were being recorded in system logs, making them accessible to other users on the system.
-  Inadequate log management: The fix in OS X Lion 10.7.4 did not remove the previously logged password entries, which meant the vulnerability persisted until the logs were manually cleaned.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Account compromise: Remote administrators and individuals with physical access to the affected systems could potentially obtain user account credentials.
-  Privacy violation: The exposure of passwords violates user privacy and security.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Physical access: An attacker with physical access to the system can potentially view the system logs.
-  Remote access: Remote administrators with access to system logs can also obtain user passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Physical access to the system or administrative access to the system logs.
-  Knowledge or access to the system logs where the sensitive information was recorded.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix for this vulnerability involved deleting log files containing the passwords.
- The vulnerability specifically affected OS X Lion v10.7.3 and was addressed in OS X Lion v10.7.4.
- The vulnerability affected systems using Legacy FileVault and/or networked home directories.
