```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
    - **CSRF**: The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to induce a victim into making unintended state-changing requests to the server.
    - **Reflected XSS**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a webpage.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **CSRF**: An attacker can add news entries and prayers without the user's consent.
    - **Reflected XSS**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, which can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **CSRF**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated user, submits a forged request to the vulnerable application.
    - **Reflected XSS**: The attacker injects a malicious script into the `uid` parameter of the `gallery/index.php` URL.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **CSRF**: The attacker needs to entice a logged-in user to visit a crafted web page. The attacker does not need prior authentication or access to the server.
    - **Reflected XSS**: The attacker needs to lure the victim to click a malicious link containing the XSS payload. The attacker does not need prior authentication or access to the server.
