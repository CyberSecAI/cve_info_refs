- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in IBM DB2's Compiler - Query Rewrite component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to view data from a table to which they do not have the necessary privileges. This indicates an authorization bypass issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within DB2 databases.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the IBM DB2 system.
