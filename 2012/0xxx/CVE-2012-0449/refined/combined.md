This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla Firefox
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2012:0221-1
Rating: important
References: #744275
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 SP4
SLE SDK 10 SP4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to 3.6.26 fixing bugs and
security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed by this
update:
\*
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
\*
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported
memory safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10
and Firefox 3.6.26.
\*
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons
Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web
addresses containing square brackets around the host. If
this host was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox
attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain name.
Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6
syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may
generate errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6.
The resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0,
Thunderbird 7.0, and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in
Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
\*
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
that removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed
under certain circumstances because of a premature
notification of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free
of the child nodes could possibly allow for for remote code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
the possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of
Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding
and has the potential for remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers
Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that
when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet,
Firefox can crash due to a memory corruption. While there
is no evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is
a possibility of remote code execution.
Indications:
Please install this update.
Special Instructions and Notes:
Please reboot the system after installing this update.

openSUSE Security Update: MozillaFirefox: Version 10
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2012:0234-1
Rating: important
References: #744275
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes 5 new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 10 to fix bugs and
security issues.
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in
the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is
disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or
browser-like contexts in those products. References
CVE-2012-0443: Ben Hawkes, Christian Holler, Honza Bombas,
Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, Jan Odvarko, Peter Van Der
Beken, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety problems
that were fixed in Firefox 10.
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported memory
safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10 and
Firefox 3.6.26.
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons Firefox
has been generous in its interpretation of web addresses
containing square brackets around the host. If this host
was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox attempted to
interpret the host as a regular domain name. Gregory
Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6 syntax
using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate
errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The
resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0, Thunderbird 7.0,
and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in Firefox 3.6.26 and
Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
MFSA 2012-03/CVE-2012-0445: Alex Dvorov reported that an
attacker could replace a sub-frame in another domain's
document by using the name attribute of the sub-frame as a
form submission target. This can potentially allow for
phishing attacks against users and violates the HTML5 frame
navigation policy.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher regenrecht
reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that
removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed under
certain circumstances because of a premature notification
of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free of the child
nodes could possibly allow for for remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-05/CVE-2012-0446: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that frame scripts bypass XPConnect
security checks when calling untrusted objects. This allows
for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages
and Firefox extensions. The fix enables the Script Security
Manager (SSM) to force security checks on all frame scripts.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-06/CVE-2012-0447: Mozilla developer Tim Abraldes
reported that when encoding images as
image/vnd.microsoft.icon the resulting data was always a
fixed size, with uninitialized memory appended as padding
beyond the size of the actual image. This is the result of
mImageBufferSize in the encoder being initialized with a
value different than the size of the source image. There is
the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized memory
being appended to a PNG image when converted fron an ICO
format image. This sensitive data may then be disclosed in
the resulting image.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher regenrecht
reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative the
possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of Ogg
Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding and
has the potential for remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers Nicolas
Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that when
processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet, Firefox
can crash due to a memory corruption. While there is no
evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is a
possibility of remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-09/CVE-2012-0450: magicant starmen reported that
if a user chooses to export their Firefox Sync key the
"Firefox Recovery Key.html" file is saved with incorrect
permissions, making the file contents potentially readable
by other users on Linux and OS X systems.
Firefox 3.6 is not affected by this vulnerability.

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes one version update.
Description:
Mozilla XULrunner was updated to 1.9.2.26 security update,
fixing security issues and bugs. The following security
bugs have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
\*
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported
memory safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10
and Firefox 3.6.26.
\*
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons
Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web
addresses containing square brackets around the host. If
this host was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox
attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain name.
Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6
syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may
generate errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6.
The resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0,
Thunderbird 7.0, and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in
Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
\*
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
that removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed
under certain circumstances because of a premature
notification of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free
of the child nodes could possibly allow for for remote code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
the possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of
Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding
and has the potential for remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers
Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that
when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet,
Firefox can crash due to a memory corruption. While there
is no evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is
a possibility of remote code execution.

Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3670 CVE-2012-0442 CVE-2012-0444 CVE-2012-0449

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, Debian's
variant of the Mozilla Thunderbird code base.

CVE-2011-3670
	Icedove does not not properly enforce the IPv6 literal address
	syntax, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
	information by making XMLHttpRequest calls through a proxy and
	reading the error messages.

CVE-2012-0442
	Memory corruption bugs could cause Icedove to crash or
  	possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-0444
	Icedove does not properly initialize nsChildView data
	structures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
	service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly
	execute arbitrary code via a crafted Ogg Vorbis file.

CVE-2012-0449
	Icedove allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
	(memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via a malformed XSLT stylesheet that is
	embedded in a document

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze7.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Attached image
[testcase (crashes Firefox)](attachment.cgi?id=573873)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=573873&action=edit)

Opening the attached SVG causes a crash with null IP. The SVG uses XSL transforms.
I'm reporting this as a potential security issue even though the crash is a null, because some common ways to get a null IP (e.g. stack buffer overflow) are more likely exploitable than run-of-the-mill null reads.
Crash traces (from 64-bit Debian 6.0.3):
8.0 - <https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bp-c39ae37b-3dfe-4cf0-8f66-257cc2111111>

Added URL to the same testcase because loading the attached testcase gives "Error loading stylesheet: An unknown error has occurred (805303f4)". Works via the link here.URL: <http://haltp.org/aoh/misc/repro.svg>

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=574456&action=edit)

When opening a specific SVG file (created by a mutation fuzzer), the browser will crash with EIP=0x00000000. This was tested on Firefox 3.6.24 / Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Firefox 8.0 / WinXP SP3.
Under Linux : a call to \*(%eax) at \_ZN20txStylesheetCompiler15flushCharactersEv+26 will set EIP to 0x000000. An annotated gdb session is attached. A similar behavior is constated on Firefox 8.0 (a screenshot of windbg !exploitable is attached too).

I initially just saw an XML parser error, too, but then I was able to crash.

With a locally-saved version of the testcase, I was able to crash on the first try w/ a fresh profile, in my nightly as well as in my debug build.

OK, this looks kinda bad...
We get the faulty mHandlerTable (mentioned in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=702466#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with EIP=0x00000000 when parsing SVG+XSLT")) from a call to "popHandlerTable", which pops a raw pointer off of "mOtherStack" (a stack of void\*'s) and casts this raw pointer to a txHandlerTable\*.
However, the raw pointer is \*not\* really a txHandlerTable\* -- it's in fact a txElementHandler\*, which was pushed onto the stack here:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/eb84780783ed/content/xslt/src/xslt/txStylesheetCompiler.cpp#l345>
So we're effectively casting a txElementHandler\* to a txHandlerTable\*, and then trying to work with the txHandlerTable\* pointer, and crashing.

| [Comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=702466#c7)• 13 years ago |
|  | |

Note that we never actually get a call to "pushHandlerTable" on this testcase (though we do get popHandlerTable as noted above. I don't know our XSLT code very well, but I'd expect that we'd intend for our pushHandlerTable/popHandlerTable calls to be balanced...

| --- | --- | --- |
| [Comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=702466#c8)• 13 years ago |
|  | |

So the evil popHandlerTable() call comes from txFnEndEmbed(), which calls txFnEndStylesheet(), which calls popHandlerTable().
Balancing this, we have an earlier call to txFnStartEmbed(), which in an ideal world would call txFnStartStylesheet(), which would call pushHandlerTable().
(this is all nicely balanced, with just "start" vs "end" and "push" vs "pop")
However, with this bug's testcase, txFnStartEmbed takes an early-return, because 'aState.handleEmbeddedSheet()' fails. So basically, we're in a sort of error state, and we bail out early & never get to the pushHandlerTable() call.
So, it looks like we need to detect this same error state when we're cleaning up, so we can skip the unbalanced popHandlerTable call there.

|  | |

Ah, so we actually do have the same "handleEmbeddedSheet()" check in txFnEndEmbed() -- but we pass that check there, because the state has changed between txFnStartEmbed and txFnEndEmbed.
In particular, txStylesheetCompiler::startElementInternal() sets mEmbedStatus = eInEmbed...
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/eb84780783ed/content/xslt/src/xslt/txStylesheetCompiler.cpp#l317>
...which will make "handleEmbeddedSheet()" pass, when we get to txFnEndEmbed().

Beyond the above, I don't really understand what's going on here or what the right fix is, since this XSLT code is pretty complex and not-really-touched-for-a-long-time.
I'm hoping that perhaps sicking knows what to do (or can suggest what to do)... Hopefully the info I've posted above will help him or someone else familiar with this code to figure out what needs fixing. :)Whiteboard: [see comment 6 - comment 9 for what's busted]

Is it possible to get a non-null txElementHandler\* ? This is a very small testcase so it's hard to tell if it's null because that's the only bogus value possible or just due to the testcase.

Unrealistic to fix for fx10 with the release next week (builds already in QA hands I think) but we need to fix by Fx11. Discovered independently by two researchers on the same weekend, we should assume it's fairly easy to fine should anyone else also be poking in this area.

[WIP - Add type checking to pushPtr/popPtr in XSLT code](attachment.cgi?id=592312&action=diff) (obsolete)

I'm not sure I like this, but it works. Right now it just calls NS\_ABORT\_IF\_FALSE, but it should ideally gracefully fail on the xslt compile. The string typenames should probably be swapped with an enum or somesuch.
I had a nicer version that used macros to avoid having any additional arguments to pushPtr, but I gave up on finding a simple way to tokenize the typenames in a macro.

Yeah, something like an enum is needed here. These string operations will be too slow.

[Fix state corruption when embedded stylesheet is of wrong node type](attachment.cgi?id=592333&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=592333&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=702466&attachment=592333)

The issue as I understand it is this:
1) mEmbedStatus is eNeedEmbed, as the stylesheet declaration referenced an embedded stylesheet
2) txFnStartEmbed handler is matched for a parent element, but because eInEmbed was not set it leaves without touching it.
3) An element with the ID matching said embedded stylesheet is found, and mEmbedStatus is set to eInEmbed
4) The element does not otherwise match an embedded stylesheet, so txFnStartEmbed is not one of the handlers that gets called. mEmbedStatus is still eInEmbed
5) The stack begins unwinding, calling endElement on all elements
6) Because mEmbedStatus is still eInEmbed, the exit handler for the embed handler on the stack from part 2 believes it is exiting from \*it's\* embed, and calls txFnEndStylesheet.
7) Mismatched stack.
This patch should fix this by adding a new state, eTryEmbed, which is set before calling the element handlers. If a startembed handler is reached, it calls startEmbedding() to move state into inEmbed, otherwise the startElement call moves state back to eNeedEmbed to attempt to match other elements (the XML document is invalid at this point, so we could also move to eNoEmbed).
... That is, assuming I fully understand what is going on here.

After talking to Jonas, he believes the only way the handler is skipped is due to LREs. Because the handler checks namespace, directing LREs to the embed handler should also fix this issue. This patch updates the HandlerTable to point at Stop/EndEmbed regardless.

Either of these patches seem very safe. Safe enough that I think we should take them in FF10.
The variable-stack patch is probably slightly safer in that it won't affect any behavior other than when things have gone really really bad and we'd likely crash (exploitably) anyway.
The LRE patch will only adjust behavior in very rare conditions, even for XSLT usage. It only affects embedded XSLT stylesheets which I don't think I've never seen in the wild, and it only does so with erroneous such stylesheets. In fact, we've likely always crashed for such stylesheets so it's unlikely going to affect anyone in a negative way.

Are both of these patches together necessary to plug the exploit hole? It's not clear if they're both targeting the same problem or serving different purposes. If it's the same problem, I'd prefer to take less code change.
We should also check to make sure that these patches apply to the 1.9.2 branch (marked as affected).

Either patch by itself will fix the security hole, but both should eventually be landed.
The "Validate stack usage" patch adds more safety to the XSLT compiler by type checking all elements pushed/pop'd from it's stack. Thus, stack desync in the compiler (such as caused by this bug) just cause an un-exploitable browser abort:
> ###!!! ABORT: Expected type does not match top element type on stack: 'type == aType', file /home/johns/moz/mozilla-central/content/xslt/src/xslt/txStylesheetCompiler.cpp, line 727
The other patch fixes this specific bug, but doesn't address the lack of safety for the stack, meaning any undiscovered bugs in the compiler could easily become exploitable.
I'll ensure these apply to 1.9.2 and attach an alternate version if necessary

Rebased the validate patch on 1.9.2 -- I don't have a working 3.6 build environment right now, and it's 11pm, so I can't test it other than the-involved-files-still-compile.

I applied the 1.9.2 patch and it does convert the crash from this exploitable one to the ABORT mentioned in [comment 32](/show_bug.cgi?id=702466#c32 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with EIP=0x00000000 when parsing SVG+XSLT") -- in a debug build. but NS\_ABORT\_IF\_FALSE is debug-only so I'm not sure this fixed anything.

I don't think the LRE patch made any difference. Either I crash on the abort added in the first patch, or if I comment that out I get basically the same stack as the one Nicolas got on Ubuntu with 3.6.24. The only difference is mine ends at txStylesheetCompiler::endElement (txStylesheetCompiler.cpp:379), his goes one more frame to txStylesheetCompiler::flushCharacters.
If you convert the NS\_ABORT\_IF\_FALSE to NS\_RUNTIMEABORT as in Jonas's patch then that's where we die, only under control.
This is throwing ourselves on the grenade to save our users. Should we leave this bug open until we get a fix for whatever is causing the stack to get unbalanced, clone this into a new bug for the now non-exploitable DoS (my preference), or just forget it as too rare to worry about?

Daniel - the crash in this bug should be fixed entirely by the LRE patch, whereas any other bugs that break the stack trigger the fall-on-the-grenade behaviour (that is, the abort should never be 'proper' behaviour).
If the LRE patch on 3.6 is still reaching an abort case, it's possible there's a separate issue there, which we should spin off into a new bug. The abort patch should mean it is a DoS at worst.

Turns out I hand-applied it wrong ("just one line," I thought, "how hard can it be?"). Actually using 'patch' did work to stop the crash on 3.6.

The crash does not occur in 100% of cases, but I've been able to reproduce it nearly 100% via
1) Save the crash .svg file locally
2) Visit the local file in firefox on a fresh profile
Make sure you can reproduce the crash reliably on a known-affected build - the builds with all three patches should merely print a parse error message.
For regressions - This code is 100% in XSLT parsing, so any regressions would be in XSLT documents. It specifically affects embedded stylesheets inside of XSLT documents - something which is extremely rare. I can't even find a page using them as an example, and a regression there would probably not be particularly severe.
XSLT in general is actually pretty rare - you'll mostly find it on tutorial sites explaining how to use it, e.g. <http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xsl_examples.asp>
The most likely regressions would be:
1 - Valid XSLT documents with embedded stylesheets fail to render, instead giving a parse error.
2 - XSLT documents of any kind cause the browser to immediately close with an ABORT message on console. Such a crash, if found, would not be a security risk -- It would indicate our patches had exposed another bug in the XSLT compiler.

Such a crash would signal the presence of a previously unknown lurking vulnerability mitigated by this patch, in other words also a success.blocking1.9.2: .26+ → ---

Sorry if the accidental flag unsetting alarmed folks. I was trying to agree with John that regressions like #2 would not be a security problem but in fact would be the opposite: symptoms of a security problem that has been de-fanged.blocking1.9.2: --- → .26+

Verified on latest nightly, aurora, and 10RC on Win7, Mac OS X, I tried the test case on previous builds and the application crashed, then I tried on the latest, fixed, builds, and I got an XSLT parsing error message.
I tried several of the examples in [comment #52](/show_bug.cgi?id=702466#c52 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with EIP=0x00000000 when parsing SVG+XSLT") aftewards, and I saw no parsing problems, and all of the XSLT edits applied as expected on the sample XML files.Keywords: [verified-aurora](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified-aurora&resolution=---),

Verified fixed for Firefox 3.6.26. As with Juan's testing in [comment 55](/show_bug.cgi?id=702466#c55 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with EIP=0x00000000 when parsing SVG+XSLT"), I used the attached testcase and some of the examples in [comment 52](/show_bug.cgi?id=702466#c52 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with EIP=0x00000000 when parsing SVG+XSLT"). I confirmed the behaviour in Firefox 3.6.25 and verified that it is indeed fixed in Firefox 3.6.26. Tested Windows 7, Mac OS X 10.6.8, and Ubuntu 11.10.Keywords: [verified1.9.2](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.9.2&resolution=---)
