Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0449:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing input sanitization during the processing of malformed embedded XSLT stylesheets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to processing a malformed XSLT stylesheet.
- The issue lies in the `txStylesheetCompiler`'s handling of embedded stylesheets within XSLT documents, particularly when an early return occurs in `txFnStartEmbed` due to an invalid state, leading to an unbalanced stack.
- Specifically, a `txElementHandler*` was being incorrectly cast to a `txHandlerTable*` causing a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a crash of the application.
- There's a possibility of remote code execution due to the memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attack vector involves a specially crafted SVG file with a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet. 
-  This malicious file, when loaded into the browser or other affected applications, can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to have the user load a malicious SVG file with the embedded XSLT.
- The attacker does not need any special system access beyond being able to serve a malicious file.
- The attacker must craft a specific type of malformed XSLT to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability was independently reported by Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin.
- The issue is located in the `txStylesheetCompiler::flushCharacters` function.
- The fix involved type checking the pushed pointers, and also directing LRE nodes through the appropriate handler.
- Patches were created to address the vulnerability, initially causing a controlled abort and ultimately fixing the underlying issue.
- The vulnerability was confirmed to affect Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird.
- The fix involved handling the state when the embedded style sheet is of the wrong node type, also validating the stack usage in the compiler.
