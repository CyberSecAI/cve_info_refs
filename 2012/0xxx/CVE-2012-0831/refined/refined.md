{
  "CVE-2012-0831": {
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `magic_quotes_gpc` directive during environment variable import in PHP versions prior to 5.3.10. This flaw makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks by crafting a malicious request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of the `magic_quotes_gpc` directive.",
      "Failure to restore the original `magic_quotes_gpc` setting on shutdown.",
        "SQL injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this to conduct SQL injection attacks.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can send a crafted request to a vulnerable PHP application.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
  },
    "CVE-2012-2688": {
    "vulnerability": "An integer signedness issue in PHP's `_php_stream_scandir` function, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs when `scandir()` is used on a directory with a very large number of files.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Integer signedness issue",
            "Heap-based buffer overflow"
        ],
    "impact": "Under certain conditions, this vulnerability can lead to a crash or allow execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running PHP.",
        "attack_vector": "By using the scandir() function on a directory containing an extremely large number of files.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control a directory that PHP uses scandir() on, and needs to be able to populate it with a number of files greater than INT_MAX(2,147,483,647)."
