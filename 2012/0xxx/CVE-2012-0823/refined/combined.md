Yeah generally speaking crashes in file parsers used by other
applications (especially web browsers =) are generally a problem (I'd
be pretty annoyed to lose 40 tabs all at once).

Please use CVE-2012-0823 for this issue.

Subject: (maybe) CVE request: libvpx before 1.0 crasher

libvpx (webm library) has released a new version that fixes a crasher
bug:
<http://blog.webmproject.org/2012/01/vp8-codec-sdk-duclair-released.html>

I'm not 100% sure if and in what situation crash bugs qualify as
security issues.

However, I tend to think that this one does. libvpx is used in browsers
and crashing browsers seems an issue to me.
Also, it could be used to crash automatic media re-encoding-services
(e.g. backends of video websites like youtube).

So I'd request a CVE.

### VP8 Codec SDK "Duclair" Released

"[Duclair](http://www.feathersite.com/Poultry/Ducks/Duclair/BRKDuclair.html)," the fourth named release of the [VP8 Codec SDK (libvpx)](http://www.webmproject.org/code/#libvpx_the_vp8_codec_sdk), is now available. You can download the Duclair libvpx snapshot (version 1.0.0) from our [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/webm/downloads/list) page or clone it from our [Git repository](http://git.chromium.org/gitweb/?p=webm/libvpx.git).

This release fixes a decoder crash bug introduced in Cayuga (v0.9.7), so we encourage all Cayuga users to upgrade.

Note that the VP8 format definition has not changed, only the SDK. Duclair is ABI incompatible with prior releases of libvpx, so the major version number has been increased to 1, and you must recompile your applications against the v1.0.0 libvpx headers. The API remains compatible, so code changes shouldn't be required in most applications.

**New Features**

This release introduces substantial new VP8 encoder features that are especially useful for real-time use cases such as live streaming and videoconferencing.

* Temporal scalability produces a video stream that can be decimated to different frame rates, with independent rate targeting for each substream.
* Multiframe postprocessing can make visual quality more consistent in the presence of frames that are of substantially different quality than the surrounding frames, as in the temporal scalability case and in some forced keyframe scenarios.
* Multiple-resolution encoding enables simultaneous encoding of the same content at different resolutions, resulting in much faster encoding than processing them separately.

**Performance Improvements**

In this release we focused on optimizing VP8 decoder speed and the real-time modes of the encoder.

* Decoder speed on x86 processors improved 10.5%.
* Encoder improvements followed a curve where speed settings 1-3 improved 4.0%-1.5%, speeds 4-8 improved <1%, and speeds 9-16 improved 1.5% to 10.5%, respectively.

See the [CHANGELOG](http://code.google.com/p/webm/source/browse/CHANGELOG?repo=libvpx) for a complete description.

Thanks to everyone who worked on Duclair, and welcome to our four new contributors:

* Alpha Lam
* Deb Mukherjee
* Jeff Faust
* Rafaël Carré

*John Luther is Product Manager of the WebM Project.*

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
