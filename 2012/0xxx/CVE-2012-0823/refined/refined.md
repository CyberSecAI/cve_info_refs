Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0823:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a crash bug within the libvpx library, specifically introduced in version 0.9.7 (Cayuga) and fixed in version 1.0.0 (Duclair).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A crash vulnerability in the VP8 decoder within libvpx. This is a software defect causing the application to terminate unexpectedly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is the ability to crash applications using the vulnerable libvpx library.
  - Browsers: Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to crashing web browsers.
  - Media re-encoding services:  Automatic media re-encoding services could be crashed, causing disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted (malicious) VP8 video stream that triggers the crash when processed by the vulnerable libvpx decoder.
- The vulnerability could be triggered in any application that uses libvpx to decode VP8 video.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted VP8 video stream to a vulnerable application. This could be done by embedding it in a website, or by feeding it to a media re-encoding service.
- The attacker does not need special privileges on the target system, as the vulnerability lies within the application's parsing of the video stream.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is acknowledged as a security issue because it can be used to crash browsers and other services.
- The fix was introduced in libvpx version 1.0.0, and users of previous versions (especially 0.9.7) are encouraged to upgrade.
- The new libvpx version 1.0.0 is ABI incompatible, requiring recompilation of applications against the new headers, although the API remains compatible, so code changes are expected to be minimal.
