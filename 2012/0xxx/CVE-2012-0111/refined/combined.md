#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2012verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or proof of concept code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all its secure variants (if applicable) are affected too. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1374524.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1374524.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1374524.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1374524.1 )  for further details regarding the On Request patches.

| [Description](#c0)  delta407    2002-06-18 16:44:03 UTC  ``` (shamelessly stolen from the "how to submit ebuilds" guide)  				Hi!  Please find attached upx-ebuilds.tar.gz containing upx-1.21.ebuild and ucl-1.01.ebuild. UPX depends on UCL, so they are submitted as one (but two separate ebuilds).  UPX stands for "Ultimate Packer for eXecutables", and UCL stands for "UCL Compression Library". UPX uses UCL for fast, lossless compression and can compress executables to a fraction of their size, producing little computational overhead and faster reads from the hard drive.  For locations, I suggest (and have coded for) app-misc/upx and dev-libs/ucl.  --delta407 ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  delta407    2002-06-18 16:44:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1597](attachment.cgi?id=1597 "The ebuild files") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=1597&action=edit "The ebuild files")] The ebuild files ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2002-06-18 19:37:01 UTC  ``` next time please shamelessly steal the part from the howto on howto set the  summary of your new pkg: Fill in the Summary field with a brief note of what package you are submitting  and whether it's an update or a new submission. Something like the following is  great: foo-bar-x.y.z.ebuild (New Package) or foo-x.y.z.ebuild (Update)  k thx dad ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  delta407    2002-06-18 19:39:03 UTC  ``` Oh, sorry, will do. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Ryan Phillips (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-06-21 17:09:26 UTC  ``` committed both packages. ``` |  |
