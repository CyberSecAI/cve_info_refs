Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0949:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Update Manager's Apport hook incorrectly uploading certain system state archive files to Launchpad when reporting bugs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Data Handling:** The Update Manager's Apport hook was not sanitizing system state archive files before uploading them to Launchpad, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The system state archive files could contain repository credentials, which are sensitive pieces of information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Repository Credentials:** By uploading system state archive files to Launchpad bug reports, the repository credentials could become publicly accessible, allowing malicious actors access to private repositories.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to repository credentials could enable attackers to potentially compromise the system or its update process.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Bug Reporting:** A user reporting a bug through the Apport hook could inadvertently trigger the upload of the vulnerable archive file, which would then be publicly exposed.
- **Public Bug Reports:** Once uploaded, the archive file, along with the exposed credentials, could be accessed by anyone who can view the public bug report on Launchpad.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **No privileged access required:** An attacker does not need privileged access to exploit this vulnerability, as any user triggering the Apport hook could cause the upload.
- **Access to public bug reports:** The attacker needs access to public Launchpad bug reports where the vulnerable archive files were uploaded.
