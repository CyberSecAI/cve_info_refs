The provided content is related to CVE-2012-0473.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect template argument being passed to the `FindMaxElementInSubArray` function within `WebGLBuffer::FindMaxUshortElement`. This function is responsible for calculating the maximum index used in WebGL draw calls, to validate that the provided indices are within the allocated buffer. Passing the incorrect template argument results in the maximum index being calculated incorrectly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is an incorrect calculation of the maximum index, which allows reading of arbitrary video memory. Specifically, indices greater than or equal to 32768 are ignored by the calculation. This leads to an out-of-bounds read when `drawElements` is called with indices in the range 32768-65535.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read data from illegal video memory by crafting WebGL draw calls that use indices in the affected range, potentially leading to information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through malicious WebGL content loaded in a web browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to serve or inject malicious WebGL content to be rendered by a vulnerable browser. This requires the attacker to control a website or to find a way to inject malicious javascript to a vulnerable site.
