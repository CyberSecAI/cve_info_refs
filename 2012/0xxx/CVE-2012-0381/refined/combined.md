Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when   they are configured to use IKE version 1 (IKEv1).  A number of features use IKEv1, including different Virtual Private Networks (VPN) such as:    + LAN-to-LAN VPN   + Remote access VPN (excluding SSLVPN)   + Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)   + Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)There are two methods to determine if a device is configured for IKE:   + Determine if IKE ports are open on a running device   + Determine if IKE features are included in the device configurationDetermine if IKE Ports are Open on a Running Device The preferred method to determine if a device has been configured for IKE is to issue the   **show ip sockets** or **show udp** EXEC command. If the device has UDP port 500, UDP port 4500, UDP port 848, or UDP port 4848 open, it is processing IKE packets.  In the following example, the device is processing IKE packets in UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500,   using either IPv4 or IPv6:  ```   router# show udp   Proto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF    17       --listen--          192.168.130.21    500   0   0 1001011   0     17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN           500   0   0 1020011   0     17       --listen--          192.168.130.21   4500   0   0 1001011   0     17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN          4500   0   0 1020011   0    !--- Output truncated   router#      ``` Determine if IKE Features are included in the Device ConfigurationTo determine if a Cisco IOS device configuration is vulnerable, the   administrator needs to establish whether there is at least one configured   feature that uses IKE. This can be achieved by using the    **show run | include crypto map|tunnel protection ipsec|crypto gdoi** enable mode command.   If the output of this command contains either   *crypto map*, *tunnel protection ipsec,* or, *crypto gdoi*   then the device contains an IKE configuration.   The following example shows a device that has been configured for IKE: ```   router# show run | include crypto map|tunnel protection ipsec|crypto gdoi   crypto map CM 100 ipsec-isakmp     crypto map CM   router#      ``` Determine the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The IKE protocol is used in the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) protocol suite to negotiate cryptographic attributes that will be used to encrypt or authenticate the communication session. These attributes include cryptographic algorithm, mode, and shared keys. The end result of IKE is a shared session secret that will be used to derive cryptographic keys. Cisco IOS Software supports IKE for IPv4 and IPv6 communications. IKE communication can use any of the following UDP ports:    + UDP port 500   + UDP port 4500, NAT Traversal (NAT-T)   + UDP port 848, Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)   + UDP port 4848, GDOI NAT-T The IKEv1 feature of Cisco IOS Software   contains a vulnerability that could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an   affected device.         An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using either IPv4 or IPv6 on any of the listed UDP ports. Spoofing of packets that could exploit this vulnerability is limited because the attacker needs to either receive or have access to the initial response from the vulnerable device. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCts38429 and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-0381.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2012 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release, where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
