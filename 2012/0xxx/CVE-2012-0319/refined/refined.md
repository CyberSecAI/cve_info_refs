Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-0319:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The primary root cause is an **OS command injection vulnerability** within the file management system of Movable Type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **OS Command Injection:** The file management system allows for the execution of arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Session Hijacking and CSRF:** Vulnerabilities exist in the commenting and community scripts, enabling session hijacking and cross-site request forgery attacks.
*   **XSS:** Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are present in templates where variables are not properly escaped, as well as in the `mt-wizard.cgi` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** A user with upload privileges can execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack user sessions, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
*   **CSRF:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on a victim's browser.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject client-side scripts into web pages, which can be viewed by other users, potentially leading to data theft or other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File Upload:** The primary attack vector for the OS command injection is through the file management system.
*   **Commenting and Community Scripts:** Session hijacking and CSRF attacks are executed via these scripts.
*  **Unescaped Template Variables:** XSS attacks are achieved by injecting malicious scripts into template variables.
*   **mt-wizard.cgi:** Another XSS vector is the `mt-wizard.cgi` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **OS Command Injection:** Requires a user account with permission to sign in to the admin script and upload files.
*   **Session Hijacking/CSRF:** Remote attacker can perform attacks against other users.
*   **XSS:** A remote attacker can inject scripts viewed by other users.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered through internal security audits and a report from Trustwave (TWSL2012-003).
*   The affected versions are Movable Type 5.12, 5.06, 4.37, 4.292 and earlier.
*   The vulnerabilities are addressed in Movable Type versions 5.13, 5.07, and 4.38.
*   The `mt:Include file="XXX"` attribute is disabled by default in the updated versions to prevent arbitrary file access.
*   Additional file extensions (.pm, .so, .rb, .htc) have been added to the `DeniedAssetFileExtensions` configuration directive.
