{
  "CVE-2012-0884": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the PKCS#7 and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) implementations in OpenSSL. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to perform a Bleichenbacher attack to decrypt an encrypted CMS, PKCS#7, or S/MIME message by sending a large number of chosen ciphertext messages to a service using OpenSSL and measuring error response times.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The implementation of Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and PKCS #7 in OpenSSL does not properly restrict certain oracle behavior, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to decrypt data via a Million Message Attack (MMA) adaptive chosen ciphertext attack.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Bleichenbacher attack",
	  "Improper restriction of oracle behavior."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can decrypt an encrypted CMS, PKCS#7, or S/MIME message.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a large number of chosen ciphertext messages to a service using OpenSSL.",
      "Measuring error response times."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker able to send crafted messages and measure response times is required to perform the attack."
