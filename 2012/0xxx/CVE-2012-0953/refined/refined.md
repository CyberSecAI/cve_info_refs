Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0953:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a kernel heap contents leak race in the ioctl handler of the NVIDIA graphics driver. It occurs because the driver copies the contents of kernel heap memory back to the user buffer even when the operation fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Kernel heap information leak:** The ioctl handler copies kernel heap memory to user space even on failure.
*   **Race condition:** The vulnerability can be exploited by racing the ioctl with a change in VMA (Virtual Memory Area) protections.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information disclosure:** By racing the ioctl with changes to VMA protections, an attacker can extract uncleared kernel heap memory. This leaked memory might contain sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **IOCTL calls:** The vulnerability is triggered through specific ioctl calls to the NVIDIA graphics driver.
*   **Race condition:** The attacker needs to create a race condition by concurrently modifying VMA protections while making the vulnerable ioctl call.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to make ioctl calls to the NVIDIA driver.
*   **Ability to modify VMA protections:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the memory protections of a user-controlled memory region that is used as the buffer for the ioctl call.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the race condition. This may require precise timing.

**Summary of Exploit:**

1.  **Allocate Kernel Memory:** The driver allocates memory in the kernel heap using `NV_KMALLOC` for the ioctl operation.
2.  **Copy User Data:** The driver copies data from the user-provided buffer into the allocated kernel memory using `copy_from_user`.
3.  **VMA Modification Race:** The attacker initiates a race by setting the VMA protections for the user buffer to `PROT_NONE` before the copy operation (2).
4.  **Copy Failure:** The `copy_from_user` fails due to the `PROT_NONE` protection.
5.  **VMA Modification:** Simultaneously, another thread sets the VMA for the buffer to `PROT_WRITE`.
6.  **Copy to User:** The driver, despite the failure in step 4, still attempts to copy data from the kernel buffer back to the user buffer using `copy_to_user`. Because of step 5, the copy succeeds, leaking the kernel memory.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, which simply states: "A race condition was discovered in the kernel ioctl handler which allowed for the contents of the kernel heap to be leaked".
