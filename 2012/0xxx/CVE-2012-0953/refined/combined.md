### Bug Description

Hello,

While I haven't had time to prove these out, they seem to be problems.

1) Race, available only to uid 0 (but uid 0 should not mean ring-0 access): /proc/driver/nvidia/registry is vulnerable to a write race that can result in a limited heap overflow.

nv\_procfs\_write\_registry does not perform locking on nvfp->off, so two writers (of the same fd) could race to confuse the bytes\_left and proc\_buffer locations, leading to heap overflow:

writer 1: bytes\_left = (NV\_PROC\_WRITE\_BUFFER\_SIZE - nvfp->off - 1);

writer 1: ...

writer 1: copy\_from\_user(proc\_buffer, buffer, count))

writer 2: bytes\_left = (NV\_PROC\_WRITE\_BUFFER\_SIZE - nvfp->off - 1);

writer 1: nvfp->off += count;

writer 2: ...

writer 2: proc\_buffer = &((char \*)nvfp->data)[nvfp->off];

writer 2: copy\_from\_user(proc\_buffer, buffer, count)

writer 2's count was checked against nvfp->off before it was moved, and writer 2's proc\_buffer is now offset by nvfp->off, allowing a write past the end of the heap buffer, by at most NV\_PROC\_WRITE\_BUFFER\_SIZE (64k) - 2 bytes.

2) Heap overflow in control device ioctl: minimum size of the ioctl buffer is not checked for NV\_ESC\_CARD\_INFO, which will write 50 bytes per device to the allocated kernel buffer (which was sized to the input buffer), before attempting to then write it back to the user buffer. With a minimum 1 byte buffer, this is a 49 byte overflow, since the rm\_api->magic check doesn't actually abort the ioctl.

I expect there are additional heap overflows in the rm\_ioctl function since it is not passed arg\_size as a parameter, but I didn't have time to examine the binary module. Seems like enforcing a minimum allocation size when calling rm\_ioctl would be the simplest fix.

3) Kernel heap contents leak race in ioctl handler: the ioctl will copy the contents of kernel heap back to the user buffer even on failure. By racing the ioctl with a change in VMA protections, it should be possible to extract uncleared kernel heap memory:

thread 1: set VMA for arg\_ptr to PROT\_NONE

thread 1: NV\_KMALLOC(arg\_copy, arg\_size);

thread 1: copy\_from\_user(arg\_copy, arg\_ptr, arg\_size) <- fails and jumps to "done"

thread 2: set VMA for arg\_ptr to PROT\_WRITE

thread 1: if (arg\_copy != NULL) ... copy\_to\_user(arg\_ptr, arg\_copy, arg\_size)

Hi everybody,

All three of these potential races/overflows should be resolved in the new 295.53 driver. Please have the original reporter verify that the resolution is satisfactory for all three issues.

You should be able to just diff the kernel module interface layer sources between 295.49 and 295.53. I'll pull the actual individual changes to make review easier, and to filter away any unrelated changes.

Sorry, it turned out that one of the changes required changes to non open-source portions of the driver code. They are pretty basic changes, but I'm not authorized to release the complete patch. I will post sanitized patches, which only include the open-source changes, shortly.

The patch "proclock.diff" addresses problem (1) identified here.

The patch "ioctl.diff" addresses problems (2) and (3). Unfortunately, this patch is heavily redacted, due to the bulk of the changes having been made in non-open source parts of the driver. Note that changes to the Solaris interface layer are also redacted, due to the licensing for the Solaris driver: the Solaris interface layer changes are functionally equivalent to the Linux and FreeBSD changes.

@Daniel:

So, have these been fixed in 295.59 now? Should we update all Ubuntu releases to that version?

What about the legacy GPU trees, have they been updated also?
