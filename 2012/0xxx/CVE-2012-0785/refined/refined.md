  "cveId": "CVE-2012-0785",
  "description": "Hash collision attack vulnerability in Jenkins before 1.447, Jenkins LTS before 1.424.2, and Jenkins Enterprise by CloudBees 1.424.x before 1.424.2.1 and 1.400.x before 1.400.0.11 could allow remote attackers to cause a considerable CPU load, aka \"the Hash DoS attack.\"",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the way Jenkins handles HTTP parameters, specifically how it processes and stores them using hash-based data structures. This allows an attacker to craft a request with a large number of parameters that cause hash collisions, leading to excessive CPU usage.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Hash collision vulnerability",
       "Denial of Service vulnerability (DoS)"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful attack can lead to a denial of service by causing excessive CPU load on the Jenkins server, making it unresponsive to legitimate user requests. This could impact availability of critical CI/CD pipelines.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Remote attack over a network",
      "Crafted HTTP requests"
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server. No authentication or prior access is required"
