```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Bugzilla allowed UTF-8 characters, including homoglyphs from other alphabets that look identical to standard ASCII letters, in email addresses used as usernames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  
    - Improper input validation of email addresses, allowing non-ASCII characters.
    -  Homoglyph attack: Visually similar but distinct characters can be used to create impersonation risks.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Account Impersonation**: Attackers could create accounts with email addresses visually similar to legitimate users (e.g., `admin@mozilla.org` vs `Ð°dmin@mozilla.org`), potentially allowing them to impersonate those users.
    - **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers could be CC'd on private bugs by creating a similar-looking email address to a user who should have access.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - User registration/creation
    - Adding users to the CC list on bugs
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to create user accounts or add users to the CC list.
    - Knowledge of potential target email addresses to impersonate.
