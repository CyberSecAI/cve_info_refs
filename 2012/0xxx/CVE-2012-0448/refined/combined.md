| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=714472#c0)• 13 years ago |
|  | |

Bugzilla allows utf8 in email addresses, including characters in the Cryllic alphabet that look identical to standard ascii letters. For example, admin@mozilla.org and аdmin@mozilla.org are two distinct email addresses (the latter has a Cryllic a). Given that email addresses are used as usernames, this poses an impersonation risk. It could also be used by an attacker to maintain access to a victim's account, since their email address wouldn't appear to have changed.
Such attacks are severely limited by bugzilla's email validation process. I have been unable to figure out where emails sent by the current version of BMO to addresses containing utf8 actually end up. Bugzilla 4.2rc1+ sends emails to addresses with utf8 preceding the @ fine (eg bаd@sunday.slyip.net), but again utf8 in the domain name (eg good@fridаy.slyip.net) causes the emails to go missing. Allowing utf8 in the domain name would be much worse, since anyone could register gmаil.com or mozillа.org
I'm not yet certain that I have fully explored the threats posed by this.

[Bug 319953](/show_bug.cgi?id=319953 "RESOLVED FIXED - Missing real email syntax check") would be a first step to fix this problem, or even fix it entirely. For the record, valid email addresses are defined in RFC 5322 section 3.4.1 (which obsoletes RFC 2822, which itself obsoleted RFC 822), see <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1>URL: [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#se...](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1)Depends on: [319953](/show_bug.cgi?id=319953 "RESOLVED FIXED - Missing real email syntax check")Summary: utf8 homoglyphs are allowed in usernames → utf8 homoglyphs are allowed in email addresses

Adhering to the RFC looks like a sensible fix.
Bugzilla 4.2rc1+ will send email to addresses with utf8 in the domain name. Rather than encoding the utf8 with punycode it uses some other method. This was established using good@bаd.sunday.slyip.net and setting a DNS wildcard for \*.sunday.slyip.net
This means any legitimate email address can be spoofed.Whiteboard: [infrasec:input]

I tested аdmin@mozilla.org (with the Cryllic a) against $Email::Address::addr\_spec, and it passes.
rjbs: per RFC 2822 and RFC 5322 section 3.4.1, it appears that dot-atom is based on atext (section 3.2.3/3.2.4) which itself contains ALPHA, which seems to be "Any character except controls, SP, and specials". But it says nothing about US-ASCII or the whole Unicode range, unless I miss something. Do you know if ALPHA really means US-ASCII only or the whole Unicode range?

mailbox data are entirely ASCII. Those RFCs predate Unicode, and §1.2 specifies ASCII anyway. I have just released 1.893, which rejects non-ASCII input prima facie.

James said he successfully got bugmails from landfill with an account which has non-ASCII characters in the email address, so this is exploitable. The attacker could use this trick to get access to bugs he shouldn't be allowed to see if his email address looks similar to e.g. a member of the security team. The user wanting to CC the security guy could inavertendly CC the wrong user, as the email address would appear to be correct in the user-autocompletion list.Flags: blocking4.2+Flags: blocking4.0.4+Flags: blocking3.6.8+Flags: blocking3.4.14+Summary: utf8 homoglyphs are allowed in email addresses → [SECURITY] utf8 homoglyphs are allowed in email addresses, which could allow an attacker to be CC'ed to private bugs by accidentTarget Milestone: --- → Bugzilla 3.4

looks and works good.
the error message displayed could be misleading:
The e-mail address you entered (チーズ@glob.com.au) didn't pass our syntax checking for a legal email address. A legal address must contain exactly one '@', and at least one '.' after the @. It must also not contain any of these special characters: \ ( ) & < > , ; : " [ ], or any whitespace.
perhaps:

"Non-English characters" is not the right description - there are plenty of non-English languages which use these characters. "Non-Latin letters" would be a bit more accurate - A-Z is the Latin alphabet.
However, I'm not sure this is the right fix.
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_and_email> says that there is an RFC 2047, which explains how e.g. Japanese people can use their own names as email addresses. That's a low-numbered RFC; presumably there is support for it?
Also, we need to support IDN domain names, and the proper display thereof.
I agree that this problem is a problem; however, telling people they can't use their Internationalized Domain Names or perfectly legal email addresses in Bugzilla isn't the right fix.

No, RFC 2047 (which is updated by RFC 2231) says that you can use Unicode for your real name, not in the email address itself. Bugzilla is fine with Unicode in the real name.
The other RFC mentioned in this page, RFC 3490, is obsoleted by RFC 5891. And RFC 5891 states that (section 3.2.2):
"IDNA does not update the
existing email standards, which allow only ASCII characters in local
parts. Even though work is in progress to define
internationalization for email addresses [RFC4952], changes to the
email address part of the SOA RDATA would require action in, or
updates to, other standards, specifically those that specify the
format of the SOA RR."
RFC 4952 is itself updated by RFC 5336 which has the status "EXPERIMENTAL". So I wouldn't rely on it till it becomes a real standard. For now, I prefer the safe approach and ban non-ASCII characters.
For your information, the proposed syntax for email addresses is defined in RFC 5335, section 4.4: <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5335#section-4.4>, where UTF8 characters would be allowed in both the local part and domain name of the email address.
> I agree that this problem is a problem; however, telling people they can't

> in Bugzilla isn't the right fix.
No current specification says that it's currently legal to use the Internationalized Domain Names in email addresses. The two specs RFC 5335 and 5336 are still experimental.

Read also RFC 4952 section 9 "Security Considerations":
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4952#section-9>
In particular:
"In addition, email addresses are used in many contexts other than
sending mail, such as for identifiers under various circumstances
(see Section 6.3). Each of those contexts will need to be evaluated,
in turn, to determine whether the use of non-ASCII forms is
appropriate and what particular issues they raise."

Sure, but this won't happen before several years, IMO.

The problem with "Non-Latin letters" is that nobody will understand what this means, besides geeks. If we cannot propose a good wording which everybody can understand, I prefer to not rephrase the error message. Remember that the email address must be real, and I doubt there are non-latin email addresses in the wild already.

"Non-Latin letters" is wrong for Geeks anyway. There are 1176 Unicode codepoints considered Latin and Letter but not ASCII. One of them is in my name, for Pete's sake!
I suggest "the email address you provided has illegal characters in it." This restriction should never be hit unless (a) the user is doing something weird, and probably already knows it or (b) the user has made a mistake, and can see it by looking.
Showing the illegal characters would be possible, if someone feels this is absolutely necessary, at least in the case of non-ASCII characters. Giving a complete list of allowed characters in a help document would not be out of the question.
I would suggest not accepting characters with qtext in the local-part, which should greatly simplify what would have to be enumerated.

Please note that I've made another Email::Address release that loosens the restriction so that non-ASCII content is now allowed in the address phrase, but not the address itself. That is, this is legal:
"R. Julián Signes" <rjbs@cpan.org>
but not:
"R. Signes" <rj́bs@cpan.org>

Gen, could we get your input on this issue?
<dveditz> LpSolit: huh, anyone know any big bugzilla deployments in asia?
<dveditz> I would be surprised if they didn't allow non-ascii mail addresses
<dveditz> spec or no spec
<dveditz> and I know for sure people get mail at IDNA domains (but the mail software uses the punycode (ASCII) representation to talk to each other)
<dveditz> maybe ask Gen, he'd know if asians used non-ascii mail addresses

Offhand I do not know of any large bugzilla deployments in Asia (or where IDN are used.)
I do know that in Japan, SMS was never used by the mobile carriers and in place of SMS was email. Email addresses were ascii (as IDN support for email only arrived recently.) So the practice of not supporting IDN in email is quite broad in Japan.
We can ask Channy Yun for the status in Korea, Bob Chao for the status in Taiwan, and the Mozilla Online team for the status in China but my guess is that all across Asia, email has not supported IDN for the most part.

# 4.2.rc1, 4.0.3, 3.6.7, and 3.4.13 Security Advisory

Tuesday, Jan 31st, 2012
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* When a user creates a new account, Bugzilla doesn't correctly
  reject email addresses containing non-ASCII characters, which
  could be used to impersonate another user account.

* A CSRF vulnerability in the implementation of the JSON-RPC API
  could be used to make changes to bugs or execute some admin tasks
  without the victim's knowledge.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Account Impersonation
Affected:    2.0 to 3.4.13, 3.5.1 to 3.6.7, 3.7.1 to 4.0.3, 4.1.1 to 4.2rc1
Fixed In:    3.4.14, 3.6.8, 4.0.4, 4.2rc2
Description: When a user creates a new account, Bugzilla doesn't
             correctly reject email addresses containing non-ASCII
             characters, which could be used to impersonate another
             user account. Such email addresses could look visually
             identical to other valid email addresses, and an attacker
             could try to confuse other users and be added to bugs he
             shouldn't have access to.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=714472
CVE Number:  CVE-2012-0448

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    3.5.1 to 3.6.7, 3.7.1 to 4.0.3, 4.1.1 to 4.2rc1
Fixed In:    3.6.8, 4.0.4, 4.2rc2
Description: Due to a lack of validation of the Content-Type header
             when making POST requests to jsonrpc.cgi, a possible
             CSRF vulnerability was discovered. If a user visits an
             HTML page with some malicious JS code in it, an attacker
             could make changes to a remote Bugzilla installation on
             behalf of the victim's account by using the JSON-RPC API.
             The user would have had to be already logged in to the
             target site for the vulnerability to work.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718319
CVE Number:  CVE-2012-0440

Vulnerability Solutions

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# BMO

From MozillaWiki
(Redirected from [BMO/](/index.php?title=BMO/&redirect=no "BMO/"))

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

This is the main public page for all things related to <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org>, aka BMO, Mozilla's customized version of [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org).

BMO is a core piece of infrastructure at Mozilla. It is used to track not only bugs and feature requests but also many other tasks across various teams.

The BMO source is a slightly modified fork of Bugzilla with many custom extensions. It is currently based on Bugzilla 4.2 but with many features backported from 4.4 and master. All the BMO devs are also involved in the Bugzilla project, and we contribute features and fixes upstream where they are generally applicable, that is, not too specific to Mozilla's particular needs.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

# B-Team

The team that works on BMO is called the B-Team, because of past affiliation with the defunct Automation and Tools team (A-Team).

* dkl: Dave Lawrence (Owner/Engineer)
* glob (Manager)

The Low-level, security, and quality tools team contributes tooling, and development:

* calixte: Calixte Denizet, (AutoNag)
* marco: Marco Castelluccio, (BugBug)

We also also have some volunteers, that we consider to be part of the B-Team as well:

* seban: Sebastin Santy (long-term volunteer, past GSoC student)
* atoll: Richard Solderberg (Reviewer-at-Large, slightly borrowed from Mozilla IT)
* kohei: Kohei Yoshino, (UX Designer)
* *... and you can be one too!*

There are also some people that still have some involvement with BMO,
but their day-to-day attention is directed to other parts of Mozilla.

* zeid: Zeid Zabaneh (Engineer)

Past contributors include:

* mary: Mary Umoh (Intern, Summer 2017)
* gerv: Gervase Markham

# New Users

Getting used to Bugzilla can be a bit daunting. We have a short [introductory video](https://gerv.makes.org/popcorn/1bn6) available that is as gentle as possible. You may also be interested in the [[MDN section about Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Bugzilla)], which contains information more suitable as an introduction to a general audience. Of special interest is the MDN article, [What to do and what not to do in Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/What_to_do_and_what_not_to_do_in_Bugzilla), which contains instructions on getting elevated privileges.

# New Bots

If you have a bot that uses BMO, be sure to add it to the [BMO/Bot Registry](/BMO/Bot_Registry "BMO/Bot Registry")
so we know who to contact about it!

# User Guide

We're putting together a [user guide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide") with helpful information on various aspects of Bugzilla. New and experienced users alike should benefit from it. There's a lot to go through, so please feel free to contribute!

# Road Map

We keep a yearly [road map](/BMO/Road_Map "BMO/Road Map") with our medium-term plans (1-2 years), at a high level. Also see our [current projects](/BMO#Current_Projects "BMO") for some of the big items we are working on in the current quarter.

# Browser Support For BMO

Full Support includes: The current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, and Edge; and the latest Firefox ESR.

Limited Support includes: The previous versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, Edge, and Firefox ESR; and Firefox Nightly.

Internet Explorer is no longer supported, though some features may still work with IE 11.

See [bug 1359310](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1359310) and [bug 1422435](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422435).

## JavaScript and Analytics

JavaScript is required to use bugzilla.mozilla.org.

The `Do Not Track` header sent by your browser is honored.

# Third-Party Applications

Lots and lots of web apps and general tools have been written to interface with BMO. We have started [cataloguing them](/BMO/ThirdPartyApps "BMO/ThirdPartyApps"). If you're looking for different ways to interface with BMO, check it out; similarly, if you are thinking about writing an app, check the catalogue to see if something similar exists that you could use, contribute to, or fork before setting out on your own.

There's one in particular that is particularly important: [Phabricator](https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html), Mozilla's new and growing code-review tool.

# More Information about BMO

Our discussion forum is mozilla.tools.bmo [[mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/tools-bmo)] [[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla.tools.bmo)] [USENET].

We also have answers to [Frequently Asked Questions](/BMO/FAQ "BMO/FAQ") and a slightly-but-not-too-out-of-date [hardware diagram](http://people.mozilla.org/~justdave/BugzillaPhysicalDiagram-rev110504.png).

If you're building an application or tool that interfaces with BMO, you may be interested in the following:

* [Best practices and etiquette](/BMO/Integration_Best_Practice "BMO/Integration Best Practice") for integrating external apps with BMO
* Info and plans on Bugzilla's [REST API](/Bugzilla%3AREST_API "Bugzilla:REST API"), and the older, deprecated [BzAPI](/Bugzilla%3ABzAPI "Bugzilla:BzAPI").

# Contributing to BMO

If you'd like to help out with BMO specifically (as opposed to the general upstream [Bugzilla project](/Bugzilla "Bugzilla")), you can find us in #bmo on irc.mozilla.org. If you plan on contributing patches, see the documentation in the [README.rst](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/blob/master/README.rst). You can file bugs under the [bugzilla.mozilla.org product](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org). Don't file them under the Bugzilla product unless you are sure it's a bug in the general Bugzilla product. In particular, all administrative changes should be filed under bugzilla.mozilla.org (see below for more).

# Policies and Procedures

## Code Updates

Code updates are normally deployed to bugzilla.mozilla.org late Monday/early Tuesday, US/Pacific time, at no specific time, if changes need to be pushed out. Security fixes or other fatal type errors will always go out as soon as possible.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [BMO/Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

## Administrative Changes

If you need changes to BMO's configuration to support your team, project, etc., please consult this page before filing bugs:

* [General information on requesting Changes to BMO](/BMO/Requesting_Changes "BMO/Requesting Changes")

## BMO Administrative Processes

* [Adding a new product](/BMO/new-product "BMO/new-product")
* [Adding a new "rapid release" version](/BMO/new-version "BMO/new-version")
* [Adding a new BMO security group](/BMO/new-security-group "BMO/new-security-group")
* [Retiring Products and Components](/BMO/RetiringComponents "BMO/RetiringComponents"): moving things to the Graveyard classification.
* [Restoring Disabled Accounts](/BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts "BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts")
* [Merging Accounts](/index.php?title=BMO/MergingAccounts&action=edit&redlink=1 "BMO/MergingAccounts (page does not exist)")
* [Disabling Accounts](/BMO/DisablingAccounts "BMO/DisablingAccounts")

See also [BMO on Mana](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45845955) (requires LDAP).

## BMO Development and Other Processes

* [Overall Development Processes](/BMO/Development_Processes "BMO/Development Processes")

* [Planning a BMO outage](/BMO/OutagePlanning "BMO/OutagePlanning")
* [Reset the development branch to master](/BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch "BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch")
* [Maintaining Perl Dependencies for BMO](/BMO/Perl_Dependencies "BMO/Perl Dependencies")

## Custom Bug Entry Forms

In the past, BMO developers supported writing custom bug entry forms specific for the needs of different projects and groups within Mozilla. In order to focus more on other important features, we will no longer be providing that support going forward. For more information on why this change was made, see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.tools.bmo/tp4dSwUfKSA).

There is a new [custom form framework](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/custom-form-example) being developed by an outside contributor named Sebastin Santy. It is still in the early stages but it eventually will be very useful for users who want to create a customized bug entry form that can be used to submit bugs to BMO.
