The provided content relates to CVE-2012-0803.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Apache CXF not correctly validating UsernameToken policies within the WS-Security framework. This incorrect validation could lead to policy alternatives being bypassed or ignored.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of UsernameToken policies.
- Vulnerability to bypass policy alternatives.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker might be able to bypass security policies enforced by UsernameToken, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions. The specific impact depends on the services and policies configured for the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending SOAP requests to a vulnerable Apache CXF service that uses WS-Security with UsernameToken policies where specific policy alternatives are not correctly enforced.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SOAP requests to the targeted Apache CXF service.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable policy configuration and craft a request to exploit the weakness.
