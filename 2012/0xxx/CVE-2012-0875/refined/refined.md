{
  "CVE-2012-0875": {
    "vulnerability": "An invalid pointer read flaw was found in the way SystemTap handled malformed debugging information in DWARF format.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because SystemTap does not correctly handle malformed DWARF debugging information, specifically when a DW_CFA operation that defines the CFA as a DWARF expression is followed by a DW_CFA operation that redefines the CFA as a register + offset. The software fails to reset the REG_STATE.cfa_is_expr flag which makes compute_expr() interpret the register/offset as an expression pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed DWARF debugging information.",
      "Use of a union for both the CFA expression pointer and register/offset without proper flag reset."
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged user could crash the system or potentially read arbitrary kernel memory. A privileged user can trigger the flaw when tricked into instrumenting a specially crafted ELF binary.",
    "attack_vector": "An unprivileged user in the stapusr group can trigger the vulnerability by exploiting malformed debugging information when unprivileged mode is enabled. A privileged user (root or a member of the stapdev group) can trigger this vulnerability when tricked into instrumenting a specially-crafted ELF binary.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "For unprivileged exploitation, the attacker needs to be a member of the 'stapusr' group with unprivileged mode enabled and 'signer,all-users' stap-server trust configured. For privileged exploitation, the attacker needs to be able to trick a privileged user to instrument a malicious ELF binary. ",
       "additional_details": "The flaw was introduced via git commit 16d59279f, affecting systemtap >= 1.4. SystemTap users should upgrade to the updated packages containing the backported patch."
