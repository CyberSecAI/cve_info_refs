  "CVE-2012-0022": {
    "description": "It was found that JBoss Web did not handle large numbers of parameters and large parameter values efficiently. A remote attacker could make a JBoss Web server use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP request containing a large number of parameters or large parameter values. This update introduces limits on the number of parameters and headers processed per request to address this issue.",

      "root_cause": "Inefficient handling of large numbers of parameters and large parameter values in JBoss Web/Apache Tomcat.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU usage"

      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by making the server consume excessive CPU time.",
