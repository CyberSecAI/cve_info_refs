*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies within the GWIA's handling of data via its HTTP interface, where an integer overflow can be triggered.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated remote attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable GWIA installations. This would allow for complete system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is launched remotely via the GWIA's HTTP interface, specifically by sending a crafted request that triggers the integer overflow.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable GWIA's HTTP interface. No authentication is required for this exploit.

**Affected Products:**

*   GroupWise 8.0.x up to and including 8.0.2 HP3
*   GroupWise 2012

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was resolved in GroupWise 8.0.3 HP1 and GroupWise 2012 Support Pack 1.
*   As a workaround, the GWIA's WebConsole can be disabled.
*   Alternatively, access to the GWIA's WebConsole port (default 9850) can be blocked.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Francis Provencher, Protek Research Labs via Secunia SVCRP.
*   The Secunia advisory is SA50622.
*   Previous (unsupported) versions of GroupWise are also likely vulnerable and should be upgraded.
