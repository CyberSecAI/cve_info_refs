{
  "CVE-2012-0060": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of region tags within the RPM header parsing functions.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation in `headerLoad`, `rpmReadSignature`, and `headerVerify` functions.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could craft a malicious RPM file that, when processed by RPM, could cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code before the file's digital signature is verified.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious RPM file with specially crafted header information.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to deliver the crafted RPM package to the victim system which will then process it."
  },
  "CVE-2012-0061": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper validation of the header contents total size in the `headerLoad()` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The region size validation in `headerLoad` is insufficient, allowing a region size to exceed the containing header size.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A specially crafted RPM file could cause RPM to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious RPM file with a header specifying an oversized region.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to deliver a crafted RPM package to the victim system which will then process it."
  },
   "CVE-2012-0815": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect handling of negated offsets in `headerVerifyInfo()` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The  `headerVerifyInfo()` function does not properly handle negative offsets in the header information.",
     "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious RPM file with crafted header information can cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted RPM file with a negative offset in its header.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to deliver a crafted RPM package to the victim system which will then process it."
