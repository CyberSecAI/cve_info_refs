Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0500:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2012-0500 is an unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component of Oracle JDK (Java Development Kit). The specific nature of the flaw is not detailed in the CVE description or the provided content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is described as unspecified and is related to the deployment component.  Additional information from the bug report mentions a "java-vm-args Command Argument Injection" vulnerability, suggesting a potential injection flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of successful exploitation is rated as critical (CVSS base score of 10), allowing for remote unauthorized access, and disclosure of information. Specifically, the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution on the affected system with complete control over confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`), meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.  The attack complexity is low, requiring little or no special skill from the attacker. The TELUS Security Labs advisory, linked in the Red Hat bug report, refers to vulnerabilities related to Java Web Start and JNLP files, suggesting a likely attack vector through malicious JNLP files. The double quote remote code execution vulnerability also involves crafted JNLP files, and the command argument injection allows arbitrary commands through the `java-vm-args` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to send a malicious JNLP file to a user on the vulnerable system. No authentication is required (`Au:N`).

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Oracle Java SE 6 Update 31 and Java SE 7 Update 3.
*   Red Hat has addressed this issue in various products including  RHEL, Satellite, and related supplementary releases.
*   HP has also issued advisories and updates to address the vulnerability for HP-UX systems running affected versions of the JDK and JRE.
*   SUSE also released a security update for IBM Java to address this and other vulnerabilities.
*   Several related CVEs appear alongside CVE-2012-0500 in the various advisories, suggesting a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in the same updates (e.g., CVE-2012-0497, CVE-2012-0498, CVE-2012-0499).
*   The vulnerability is associated with  "Oracle Java Web Start JNLP Double Quote Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" (ZDI-12-037) and "Oracle Java Web Start java-vm-args Command Argument Injection Remote Code Execution" (ZDI-12-039) which provide a more detailed insight to the vulnerabilities.

In summary, CVE-2012-0500 involves an unspecified flaw in the Oracle JDK Deployment component. Exploitation via malicious JNLP files allows for remote code execution with no authentication required.
