# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-027 - Critical

## Vulnerability in Windows Common Controls Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2664258)

Published: April 10, 2012 | Updated: April 26, 2012

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately disclosed vulnerability in Windows common controls. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user visits a website containing specially crafted content designed to exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit such a website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website. The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment as well, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported Microsoft software that included the Windows common controls in their default installations. This includes all supported editions of Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office 2007; Microsoft Office 2010 (except x64-based editions); Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (except Itanium-based editions), Microsoft SQL Server 2005 (except Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition, but including Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition with Advanced Services), Microsoft SQL Server 2008, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2, Microsoft BizTalk Server 2002, Microsoft Commerce Server 2002, Microsoft Commerce Server 2007, Microsoft Commerce Server 2009, Microsoft Commerce Server 2009 R2, Microsoft Visual FoxPro 8.0, Microsoft Visual FoxPro 9.0, and Visual Basic 6.0 Runtime. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by disabling the vulnerable version of the Windows common controls and replacing it with a new version that does not contain the vulnerability. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2664258](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2664258) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was** **this bulletin revised on** **April 26, 2012?**

This bulletin was revised to make several additions and corrections:

* Clarified the Affected Software to show that the update applies to all installations of Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Analysis Services Service Pack 4, as the QFE and GDR distinction does not apply to this product. This is an informational change only. There were no changes to the security update files or detection logic. Because the update has been offered correctly since initial release, customers who have already successfully installed this update do not need to take any action.
* Added Service Pack 1 versions of SQL Server 2008 R2 to the Affected Software. This is an informational change only. There were no changes to the security update files or detection logic. Because the update has been offered correctly since initial release, customers who have already successfully installed this update do not need to take any action.
* Added an entry to the update FAQ to explain which SQL Server 2000 update to use based on the version range that requires GDR updates and the version range that requires QFE updates. This is an informational change only. There were no changes to the security update files or detection logic.
* Corrected the update removal information in the Deployment section for SQL Server 2000. This is an informational change only. There were no changes to the security update files or detection logic.

**There are both GDR and QFE updates offered for SQL Server 2000. How do I know which update to use?**

First, determine your SQL Server version number. For more information on determining your SQL Server version number, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 321185](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/321185).

Second, in the table below, locate the version range that your SQL Server version number falls within. The corresponding update is the update you need to install.

**Note** If your SQL Server version number does not fall within any of the ranges in the table below, your SQL Server version is no longer supported. Please upgrade to the latest Service Pack or SQL Server product in order to apply this and future security updates.

**For SQL Server 2000:**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **8.0.2039.0 - 8.0.2064.0** | **8.0.2100.0 - 8.0.2300.0** |
| SQL Server Update |  |
| Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 4 GDR (KB983808) | Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Service Pack 4 QFE (KB983809) |

**I am running SQL Server 2005 or SQL Server 2008, which** **updates** **apply to my environment?**

By default, supported versions of Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 default installations include the Windows common controls. Microsoft Update will automatically detect and deploy the Windows common controls packages to supported versions of Microsoft SQL server 2005 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008. The update packages that apply to SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008 are the same packages that apply to Microsoft Office. See the section, **Affected Software**, for more information.

**Which components of Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office 2007,** **and Microsoft Office 2010 require updating** **to mitigate the** **vulnerability** **addressed in this bulletin?**

Because the affected binary is a shared component across multiple Microsoft Office products, the update is applicable to your installation of Microsoft Office if Microsoft Update detects that the vulnerable version of the Windows common controls is present in your installation. The update targets specific versions of Microsoft Office, not specific Microsoft Office components.

**I am a third-party application developer and I use the ActiveX control in my application. Is my application vulnerable and how do I update it?**

Developers who redistribute the ActiveX control should ensure that they update the version of the ActiveX control installed with their application by downloading the update provided in this bulletin. For more information on best practices on redistributed component use, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 835322](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/835322) and [Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa375193.aspx).

**I am developing software which contains the redistributable ActiveX control. What do I do?**

You should install the security update included in this security bulletin for your development software. If you have redistributed ActiveX control with your application, you should issue an updated version of your application to your customers with the updated version of this file included in the download of this security update for your development software.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## MSCOMCTL.OCX RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0158

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows common controls. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted webpage. When a user views the webpage, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-0158](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-0158).

#### Mitigating Factors for MSCOMCTL.OCX RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0158

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.
* The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for MSCOMCTL.OCX RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0158

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Donot open Microsoft Office and WordPad documents from untrusted sources**

  Do not open Microsoft Office or Rich Text Format (.rtf) files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
* **Prevent** **the vulnerableActiveX controls** **from being run in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate the MSCOMCTL.TreeView, MSCOMCTL.ListView2, MSCOMCTL.TreeView2, and MSCOMCTL.ListView controls in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the controls in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow the steps in the article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  To set the kill bit for the MSCOMCTL.TreeView, MSCOMCTL.ListView2, MSCOMCTL.TreeView2, and MSCOMCTL.ListView controls in the registry, follow these steps:

  1. Create a text file named Disable\_MSCOMCTL.reg with the following contents:

     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{C74190B6-8589-11d1-B16A-00C0F0283628}]

     "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{C74190B6-8589-11d1-B16A-00C0F0283628}]

     "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{996BF5E0-8044-4650-ADEB-0B013914E99C}]

     "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{996BF5E0-8044-4650-ADEB-0B013914E99C}]

     "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{9181DC5F-E07D-418A-ACA6-8EEA1ECB8E9E}]

     "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{9181DC5F-E07D-418A-ACA6-8EEA1ECB8E9E}]

     "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{bdd1f04b-858b-11d1-b16a-00c0f0283628}]

     "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

     [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility{bdd1f04b-858b-11d1-b16a-00c0f0283628}]

     "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
  2. Double-click the .reg file to apply it to an individual system.

     **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

     You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Group Policy collection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).

#### FAQ for MSCOMCTL.OCX RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0158

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system under the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the ActiveX controls, while being used in Internet Explorer, corrupts the system state in such a way as to allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**What** **are the Windows common controls?**

Windows Common Controls are ActiveX controls contained in the MSCOMCTL.OCX file. The vulnerable ActiveX controls are MSCOMCTL.TreeView, MSCOMCTL.ListView2, MSCOMCTL.TreeView2, and MSCOMCTL.ListView.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. This can include compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. Such websites could contain specially crafted content designed to exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit a website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes them to the attacker's website. Then, specially crafted web content could be used to exploit the vulnerability on affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**I am running SQL Server 2005 or SQL Server 2008, which patches apply to my environment?**

By default, supported versions of Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 default installations include the Windows common controls. Microsoft Update will automatically detect and deploy the Windows common controls packages to these supported versions of Microsoft SQL server 2005 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008.

**Which components of Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office 2007,** **and Microsoft Office 2010 require updating** **to mitigate this vulnerability?**

Because the affected binary is a shared component across multiple Microsoft Office products, the update is applicable to your installation of Microsoft Office if Microsoft Update detects that the vulnerable version of MSCOMCTL.OCX is present in your installation. The update targets specific versions of Microsoft Office, not specific Microsoft Office components.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by disabling the vulnerable version of the Windows common controls. It does this by setting the kill bit for the following class identifiers hosted in the library files:

```
{bdd1f04b-858b-11d1-b16a-00c0f0283628}
{996BF5E0-8044-4650-ADEB-0B013914E99C}
{C74190B6-8589-11d1-B16A-00C0F0283628}
{9181DC5F-E07D-418A-ACA6-8EEA1ECB8E9E}

```

The update also replaces the vulnerable version of the Windows common controls with a new version that does not contain the vulnerability.

**What is a kill bit?**

A security feature in Microsoft Internet Explorer makes it possible to prevent an ActiveX control from ever being loaded by the Internet Explorer HTML-rendering engine. This is done by making a registry setting and is referred to as setting the kill bit. After the kill bit is set, the control can never be loaded, even when it is fully installed. Setting the kill bit makes sure that even if a vulnerable component is introduced or is re-introduced to a system, it remains inert and harmless.

For more information on kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797): How to stop an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability. However, when the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published.

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft websites:

* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/q** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/q:u** | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user. |
| **/q:a** | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user. |
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files. |
| **/c** | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |
| **/r:n** | Never restarts the system after installation. |
| **/r:I** | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**. |
| **/r:a** | Always restarts the system after installation. |
| **/r:s** | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user. |
| **/n:v** | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Package Installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All** **files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Removing the Update**

This update cannot be removed.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

This section summarizes the tools and settings associated with Group Policy.

## Group Policy Tools

The following is a list of administrative tools associated with Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy administrative tools, see the following topics in this collection:

* [Group Policy Administrative Tools](cc782611%28v%3Dws.10%29)
* [Group Policy Object Editor Tools and Settings](cc758588%28v%3Dws.10%29)
* [Group Policy Management Console Technical Reference](cc778172%28v%3Dws.10%29)
* [What Is Resultant Set of Policy?](cc758010%28v%3Dws.10%29)

For information about tools specific to Group Policy extensions, see the appropriate [Group Policy Components](cc776182%28v%3Dws.10%29) topics in this collection. For more information about other Resource Kit tools, see the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit Tools page.

#### GPUpdate.exe

This tool is used for refreshing local and Active Directory policy settings on the computer from which you run the **GPUpdate** command.

##### Category

This command-line tool is included in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

##### Version compatibility

You can use GPUpdate locally on Windows XP and higher computers to refresh policy immediately. On computers running Windows 2000, this behavior is provided by the using the secedit.exe command line tool, with a specific parameter.

GPUpdate refreshes local Group Policy settings and Group Policy settings that are stored in Active Directory, including security settings, on the computer from which it is run. This command supersedes the now obsolete **/refreshpolicy** option for the secedit command line tool. For more information about GPUpdate, type **GPUpdate /?** at the command line.

#### GPResult.exe

GPResult.exe is a Group Policy tool for examining the settings applied during Group Policy refresh.

##### Category

There are two versions of GPResult: One shipped with the Windows 2000 Resource Kit; the other is included with Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. The Windows 2000 version runs only locally on Windows 2000. The windows Server 2003 version runs locally or remotely on Windows XP or Windows Server 2003.

The different versions are not compatible.

##### Version compatibility

GPResult utilizes Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) data. You can use GPResult that shipped with Windows Server 2003 family on Windows XP and higher computers. You can use GPResult that shipped with Windows 2000 Resource Kit for Windows 2000.

GPResult for Windows Server 2003 displays Group Policy settings and Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP) for a user or a computer. Because you can apply overlapping levels of policies to any computer or user, the Group Policy feature generates a resulting set of policies at logon. GPResult displays the resulting set of policies that were enforced on the computer for the specified user at logon.

GPResult for Windows 2000 estimates the Group Policy settings that would be applied at a specific computer. Full documentation for this version of GPResult is available in the readme file distributed with the tool.

#### Dcgpofix.exe: Dcgpofix

##### Category

Dcgpofix ships with Windows Server 2003.

##### Version compatibility

You can run Dcgpofix only on servers running Windows Server 2003 family. This tool can restore default domain policy and default domain controllers policy to their original state after installation, except for some security-related settings that are impossible to return to their exact original state. When you run Dcgpofix, you will lose any changes made to these Group Policy objects. For more information about Dcgpofix, type **Dcgpofix /?** at the command line.

This tool should be used as a last-resort disaster-recovery tool. A better solution is to use GPMC to back up and restore these GPOs.

#### GPMonitor.exe: Group Policy Monitor Tool

##### Category

Group Policy Monitor tool is included in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit.

##### Version compatibility

The Group Policy Monitor tool works on Windows XP and higher computers. Group Policy Monitor tool collects Group Policy information at every Group Policy refresh and sends that information to a centralized location that you specify. You can then use the Group Policy Monitor user interface (UI) to view the data. The Group Policy Monitor UI can provide a historical view of policy changes. The UI is also designed to make it easy to navigate through historical snapshots of data and trace changes. For more information about the Group Policy Monitor tool, type **GPMonitor /?** at the command line. You can find full documentation for the Group Policy Monitor tool in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit Tools.

#### GPOTool.exe: Group Policy Verification Tool

##### Category

Group Policy Verification tool is included in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit.

##### Version compatibility

The Group Policy Verification tool works on Windows 2000 and higher computers. You use Group Policy Verification tool to check the health of the Group Policy objects on domain controllers. The tool checks GPOs for consistency on each domain controller in your domain. The tool also determines whether the policies are valid and displays detailed information about replicated Group Policy objects (GPOs).

GPOTool.exe ships with the Microsoft Windows 2003 Server Resource Kit and is also available as a free download at the Gpotool.exe: Group Policy Verification Tool page.

For more information about the Group Policy Verification tool, type **GPOTool /?** at the command line. You can find full documentation for Group Policy Verification tool in the Windows Server 2003 Deployment Kit Tools.

#### AdmX.exe: ADM File Parser

##### Category

The ADM File Parser (AdmX) is a command-line tool that enables an administrator to export Group Policy settings to a tab-delimited text file. The administrator can then use the text produced by ADM File Parser (AdmX) to find changes for the policy settings between different versions of the operating systems. AdmX is for use only with policies based on administrative templates.

##### Version compatibility

The AdmX.exe tool runs on Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP Professional. AdmX.exe also requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0.

Administrators use AdmX.exe to extract policy setting information from .adm files and to list differences between two .adm files.

For more information about the ADM File Parser, type **AdmX.exe /?** at the command line.

#### Other Tools

For information about tools specific to Group Policy extensions, see the appropriate [Group Policy Components](cc776182%28v%3Dws.10%29) Tools topics in this collection.

## Group Policy Settings

Many Group Policy settings are configurable within the Administrative Template (.adm) files supplied with Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003. Administrators can access these files from the Group Policy Object Editor for a specific GPO, and can configure Group Policy settings contained in the template files.

A registry setting exists for a Group Policy template setting only when the setting state has been changed from **Not Configured** to either **Enabled** or **Disabled**. You can change the setting state from the appropriate Administrative Template node in the Group Policy Object Editor.

To download a complete reference to the Group Policy settings in the .adm files supplied with Windows Server 2003, see the Group Policy Settings Reference for Windows Server 2003. This reference is in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format.

For a reference to settings specific to Group Policy behavior, and for a list of registry locations that are associated with Group Policy on the domain controller, target, or both, see the [Group Policy Object Editor Tools and Settings](cc758588%28v%3Dws.10%29) topic in this collection.

For a reference to settings specific to Group Policy extensions, see the appropriate [Group Policy Components](cc776182%28v%3Dws.10%29) topics in this collection.
