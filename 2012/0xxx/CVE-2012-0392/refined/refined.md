Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-0392:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the insufficient input validation and improper handling of OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) expressions within the Apache Struts 2 framework. Specifically:

*   **Inadequate Parameter Name Filtering:** The `CookieInterceptor` does not properly filter parameter names, allowing attackers to inject malicious OGNL expressions through cookie names.
*  **OGNL Expression Evaluation in Exception Handling:** When exceptions occur during parameter setting, the values are evaluated as OGNL expressions, leading to code execution if an attacker provides a malicious OGNL expression.
*  **Public Constructor Access:** Even with `allowStaticMethodAccess` disabled, attackers could call public constructors with a String parameter, and access setter methods also with a String parameter, allowing for arbitrary object creation and file overwriting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** Attackers could execute arbitrary system commands by injecting OGNL expressions that invoke Java methods, including runtime execution. This is possible through:
    *   `CookieInterceptor` (CVE-2012-0392) : Exploiting the lack of filtering on cookie names.
    *   `ExceptionDelegator` (CVE-2012-0391): Triggering an exception during parameter setting to have an attacker controlled value be evaluated as an OGNL expression.
    *   `DebuggingInterceptor`: If developer mode is enabled.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By accessing public constructors and setters of Java objects via OGNL, attackers could create and overwrite arbitrary files.
*   **Bypassed Security Mechanisms:** The framework's intended protections, such as `denyMethodExecution` and parameter name whitelists in `ParameterInterceptor`, were bypassed in some cases.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Remote command execution allows attackers to gain complete control of the server, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
*   **Data Modification/Destruction:** File overwrite vulnerability could lead to data corruption or denial-of-service conditions by manipulating important configuration or data files.
*  **Information Disclosure:** In some scenarios, the exploitation of OGNL expressions may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers crafted HTTP requests with malicious OGNL expressions in:
    *   Cookie names (CookieInterceptor)
    *   Parameter values that would cause an exception. (ExceptionDelegator)
    *  Parameters while using debugging interceptor. (DebuggingInterceptor)
*   **OGNL Injection:** The core attack vector was the injection of malicious OGNL expressions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Struts 2 application.
*   **Knowledge of OGNL:** Attackers need knowledge of OGNL syntax to craft malicious expressions.
*  **Application Configuration:** Some attacks required specific application configurations, like enabling developer mode or cookie handling.

**CVE Specific Details**
This content provides details for CVE-2012-0392, specifically highlighting that the `CookieInterceptor` does not filter parameter names, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands via static method access to Java functions by setting `allowStaticMethodAccess` to true within the request using a crafted cookie header.
This is a remote command execution vulnerability.
