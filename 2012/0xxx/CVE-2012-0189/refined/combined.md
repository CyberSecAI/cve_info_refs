# Security Bulletin: IBM SPSS SamplePower vsview6 ActiveX Control vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-0189)

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

There are multiple security vulnerabilities with the VsVIEW6 ActiveX control shipped by IBM SPSS SamplePower Version 3. The vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on installations of SamplePower when the control is invoked as ActiveX by Microsoft Internet Explorer.

## Content

**VULNERABILITY DETAILS:**

**CVE IDs:** CVE-2012-0189

**DESCRIPTION:** It is possible for an attacker to compromise the VsVIEW6 ActiveX control used within IBM SPSS SamplePower to remotely execute arbitrary code by instantiating this control from Microsoft Internet Explorer. For a remote attacker to exploit these vulnerabilities in SamplePower releases, the following must be accomplished:

1. The user must have IBM SPSS SamplePower installed on the machine.

2. Attacker needs to create malicious code that would exploit the ActiveX control. This code could be part of an attachment by means of e-mail or a Web page.

3. User must be persuaded to execute the attachment or follow a Web site link that contains the malicious code via the Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser.

4. If the malicious website is running within Internet Explorer's Internet Zone, the user must typically authorize the ActiveX pop-up dialog before it could be used.

As of January 11, 2012, IBM has not received any reports of customer issues related to these security vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities were reported to IBM by the [TippingPoint Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/) and discovered by a third-party researcher, Andrea Micalizza aka rgod, working with ZDI.

**CVSS:**

Using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v2, the security ratings for these issues are:

CVSS Base Score: 9.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/72119> for the current score.

CVSS Environmental Score: Undefined

CVSS String: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

**AFFECTED PLATFORMS:**

IBM SPSS SamplePower for Windows V3.0

**REMEDIATION:**

The recommended solution is to apply the workaround as soon as possible.

***Workaround:***

Disable the use of the vulnerable ActiveX control within Internet Explorer.

**Note**: This solution contains information about modifying the Microsoft operating system registry. Before making any modifications with the Microsoft Registry Editor, it is strongly recommended that you make a backup of the existing registry. For more information about how to back up the registry refer to [Microsoft Knowledge Base article 256986](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/256986).

The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by manually setting the kill bit. Complete the following steps to set the kill bit on the machine where SamplePower is installed.

1. Start the Microsoft Windows Registry Editor (regedit).

2. Navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveXCompatibility**

3. Add a new Key:

**{****6E84D662-9599-11D2-9367-20CC03C10627}**

4. Select that Key and create a new DWORD value named:

**Compatibility Flags**

5. Set the Compatibility Flags value to:

**0x00000400**

6. Exit the Registry Editor.

7. Restart Internet Explorer.

***Mitigation(s):***

None known apply the workaround.
