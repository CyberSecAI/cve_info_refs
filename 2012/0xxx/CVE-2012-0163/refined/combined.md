## In this article

.NET is an integral part of many apps running on Windows and provides common functionality for those apps to run. For developers, .NET Framework provides a comprehensive and consistent programming model for building apps that have visually stunning user experiences and seamless and secure communication.

Note

This article is intended for **developers** who either want to install .NET Framework on their own system or who want to install it with their applications. For **users** interested in installing .NET Framework, see the individual articles that discuss installing .NET Framework on specific operating systems, such as [Install .NET Framework on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016](on-windows-10).

This article provides links for installing all versions of .NET Framework from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET Framework 4.8.1 on your computer. If you're a developer, you can also use these links to download and redistribute .NET Framework with your apps. For information on deploying a version of .NET Framework with your app, see [.NET Framework deployment guide for developers](../deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers).

Important

.NET Framework content previously digitally signed using certificates that use the SHA1 algorithm, will be retired in order to support evolving industry standards.

The following versions of .NET Framework will reach end-of-support on *April 26, 2022*: 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6.1. After this date, security fixes, updates, and technical support for these versions will no longer be provided.

If you're using .NET Framework 4.5.2, 4.6, or 4.6.1, update your deployed runtime to a more recent version, such as **.NET Framework 4.6.2**, before *April 26, 2022* in order to continue to receive updates and technical support.

Updated SHA2 signed installers will be available for .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, and 4.6.2 through 4.8. For more information, see the [SHA1 retirement plan](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/-net-framework-retiring-sha-1-content-9750f20d-a9ef-4d43-853f-2075f0a9d7da), the [.NET 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6.1 lifecycle update blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-framework-4-5-2-4-6-4-6-1-will-reach-end-of-support-on-april-26-2022/), and the [FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/-net-framework-4-5-2-4-6-4-6-1-end-of-support-faq-72b7d8ca-3057-4f0c-8404-67305d40cc04).

Important

All .NET Framework versions since .NET Framework 4 are in-place updates, so only a single 4.x version can be present on a system. In addition, particular versions of .NET Framework are preinstalled on some versions of the Windows operating system. This means that:

* If there's a later 4.x version installed on the machine already, you can't install a previous 4.x version.
* If the OS comes preinstalled with a particular .NET Framework version, you can't install a previous 4.x version on the same machine.
* If you install a later version, you don't have to first uninstall the previous version.

For more information about versions of .NET Framework and how to determine which versions are installed on a computer, see [Versions and Dependencies](../migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies) and [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Versions Are Installed](../migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed).

Note

For information on .NET Framework 3.5, see [Install the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 8](dotnet-35-windows).

Use the following table for quick links, or read further for details. To view the system requirements for .NET Framework before installation, see [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements). For help with troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-blocked-installations-and-uninstallations).

Important

Starting with Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio no longer includes .NET Framework components for .NET Framework 4.0 - 4.5.1 because these versions are no longer supported. Visual Studio 2022 and later versions can't build apps that target .NET Framework 4.0 through .NET Framework 4.5.1. To continue building these apps, you can use Visual Studio 2019 or an earlier version.

You can install the **Developer Pack** for a specific version of the .NET Framework, if one is available, on all supported platforms.

**Developer Packs** only target a specific version of .NET Framework and don't include previous versions. For example, the .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack doesn't include .NET Framework 4.7.

You can install the **Web or Offline installer** on:

* Windows 8.1 and earlier
* Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier

For a full list, see [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements).

For a general introduction to .NET Framework for both users and developers, see [Getting Started](../get-started/). For information about deploying .NET Framework with your app, see the [deployment guide](../deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers). To read about the architecture and key features of .NET Framework, see the [overview](../get-started/overview).

## Installation choices

Install a developer targeting pack to develop against the most recent version of .NET Framework in Visual Studio or another development environment, or download the .NET Framework redistributable for distribution with your app or control.

### To install the .NET Framework Developer Pack or Targeting Pack

A *targeting pack* lets your app target a specific version of .NET Framework when developing in Visual Studio and some other development environments. A *developer pack* includes a specific version of .NET Framework and its accompanying SDK along with its corresponding targeting pack.

The developer pack for .NET Framework 4.5.1 or 4.5.2, the targeting pack for .NET Framework 4.6, and the developer pack for .NET Framework 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, or 4.8 provides a particular .NET Framework's version of the reference assemblies, language packs, and IntelliSense files for use in an integrated development environment such as Visual Studio. If you're using Visual Studio, the developer pack or targeting pack also adds the installed version of .NET Framework to the target choices when you create a new project. Choose one of the following:

* [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
* [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
* [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
* [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
* [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
* [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
* [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452) to install version 4.5.2 on Windows 8.1 or earlier, Visual Studio 2013, Visual Studio 2012, or other IDEs.
* [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451) to install version 4.5.1 on Visual Studio 2012 or other IDEs.

From the developer pack download page, choose **Download**. Next, choose **Run** or **Save**, and follow the instructions when prompted. You can also install the developer pack or targeting pack for a specific version of .NET Framework by selecting it from the optional components in the **.NET desktop development** workload in the Visual Studio Installer, as the following figure shows.

[![Visual Studio installer with .NET Framework options selected.](media/guide-for-developers/visual-studio-framework.png)](media/guide-for-developers/visual-studio-framework-large.png#lightbox)

When you target a particular version of .NET Framework, your application is built by using the reference assemblies that are included with that version's developer pack. At run time, assemblies are resolved from the Global Assembly Cache, and the reference assemblies are not used.

When building an application from Visual Studio or using MSBuild from the command line, MSBuild may display error MSB3644, "The reference assemblies for framework "*framework-version*" were not found." To address the error, download the developer pack or the targeting pack for that version of .NET Framework.

### To install or download the .NET Framework redistributable

Installers download .NET Framework components for an app or control that targets those versions of .NET Framework. These components must be installed on each computer where the app or control runs. These installers are redistributable, so you can include them in the setup program for your app.

The download page is provided in several languages, but most of the downloads are provided in English only. For additional language support, you must install a language pack.

Two types of redistributable installers are available:

* **Web installer** (web bootstrapper) downloads the required components and the language pack that matches the operating system of the installation computer from the web. This package is much smaller than the offline installer but requires a consistent Internet connection. You can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install additional language support.
* **Offline installer** (standalone redistributable) contains all the required components for installing .NET Framework but doesn't contain language packs. This download is larger than the web installer. The offline installer doesn't require an internet connection. After you run the offline installer, you can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install language support. Use the offline installer if you can't rely on having a consistent Internet connection.

Both web and offline installers are designed for x86-based and x64-based computers (see [system requirements](../get-started/system-requirements)), but do not support Itanium-based computers.

1. Open the download page for the .NET Framework version you want to install:

   * [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
   * [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)
2. Select the language for the download page. This option does not download the localized resources of .NET Framework; it only affects the text displayed on the download page.
3. Choose **Download**.
4. If prompted, select the download that matches your system architecture, and then choose **Next**.
5. When the download prompt appears, do *one* of the following:

   * If you want to install .NET Framework on your computer, choose **Run**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.
   * If you want to download .NET Framework for redistribution, choose **Save**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.
6. If you want to download resources for additional languages, follow the instructions in the next section to install one or more language packs.

Note

If you encounter any problems during the installation, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-blocked-installations-and-uninstallations).

**Installation notes:**

* .NET Framework 4.5 and later versions replace .NET Framework 4.0. When you install these versions on a system that has .NET Framework 4 installed, the assemblies are replaced.
* Uninstalling .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions also removes pre-existing .NET Framework 4 files. If you want to go back to .NET Framework 4, you must reinstall it and any updates to it. See [Installing the .NET Framework 4](/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/5a4x27ek%28v%3Dvs.100%29).
* You must have administrative credentials to install .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions.
* The .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable was updated on October 9, 2012 to correct an issue related to an improper timestamp on a digital certificate, which caused the digital signature on files produced and signed by Microsoft to expire prematurely. If you previously installed the .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable package dated August 16, 2012, we recommend that you update your copy with the latest redistributable from the [.NET Framework download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45). For more information about this issue, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2749655](/en-us/security-updates/SecurityAdvisories/2012/2749655).

## To install language packs

Language packs are executable files that contain the localized resources (such as translated error messages and UI text) for supported languages. If you don't install a language pack, .NET Framework error messages and other text are displayed in English. Note that the web installer automatically installs the language pack that matches your operating system, but you can download additional language packs to your computer. The offline installers don't include any language packs.

Important

The language packs don't contain the .NET Framework components that are required to run an app, so you must run the web or offline installer before you install a language pack. If you have already installed a language pack, uninstall it, install the .NET Framework, and then reinstall the language pack.

1. Open the language pack download page for the .NET Framework version you've installed:

   * [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
   * [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)
2. In the language list, choose the language you want to download, and wait a few seconds for the page to reload in that language.
3. Choose **Download**.

The following table lists the supported languages.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

## Vulnerability in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2671605)

Published: April 10, 2012 | Updated: June 12, 2012

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution on a client system if a user views a specially crafted webpage using a web browser that can run XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs). Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. The vulnerability could also allow remote code execution on a server system running IIS, if that server allows processing ASP.NET pages and an attacker succeeds in uploading a specially crafted ASP.NET page to that server and then executes the page, as could be the case in a web hosting scenario. This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions. In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 Service Pack 3, Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4 on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft .NET Framework validates parameters when passing data to a function. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin** **rereleased** **on** **June** **12,** **2012?**

Microsoft rereleased this bulletin to reoffer the security update for all affected software. The reoffered update addresses a known issue with printing from a Windows Forms application. Installing the update originally offered on April 10, 2012 may cause certain Windows Forms applications to not print or to not honor specified printer settings when they do print; there is no impact on systems that do not use printing functionality from a .NET Framework Windows Forms application. Customers who have already successfully installed the original update are encouraged to install the reoffered update.

**Are Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5** **on Windows** **Developer Preview** **and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 Developer Preview** **affected by this vulnerability?**

Yes. This vulnerability was reported after the release of the Windows Developer Preview and the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 Developer Preview. Customers running the Developer Preview software are encouraged to download and apply the update to their systems. For more information, including Microsoft Download Center links, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles:

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912.aspx).

**I have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed; this version is not listed among the affected software in this bulletin. Do I need to install an update?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer. The .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installer chains in the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup, so installing the former also installs the latter. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2695500](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=247462).

**I have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed. Do I need to install any updates?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer. The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installer chains in both the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup and the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 setup. Therefore, customers who have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed need to install security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2695500](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=247462).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## .NET Framework Parameter Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0163

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft .NET Framework validates parameters when passing data to a function. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-0163](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-0163).

#### Mitigating Factors for .NET Framework Parameter Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0163

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability only on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and only in a web browsing attack scenario. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about [Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039).
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user or the user account of ASP.NET. Users or accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users or accounts that operate with administrative user rights.
* In a web-hosting scenario, an attacker must have permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a website and ASP.NET must be installed on that web server. In default configuration, an anonymous user cannot upload and run Microsoft .NET code on an Internet Information Server (IIS).
* Standard .NET Framework applications are not affected by this vulnerability. Only specially crafted .NET Framework applications could exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for .NET Framework Parameter Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0163

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  3. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XAML browser applications**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XPS documents**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. On the **Security** tab, click **Custom level**. Under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, set **Run components not signed with Authenticode** to either **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu, and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Reset all zones to default level**, and then click **OK**.

#### FAQ for .NET Framework Parameter Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2012-0163

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is the result of the .NET Framework improperly validating parameters when passing data to a function.

**What is** **the CLR?**

The Microsoft .NET Framework provides a run-time environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which runs the code and provides services that make the development process easier. For more information about the CLR, see the MSDN article, [Common Language Runtime Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ddk909ch%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user or the user account of ASP.NET. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are three attack scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability: a web browsing scenario, a web hosting scenario, and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions. These scenarios are described as follows:

* **Web browsing attack scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.
* **Web hosting attack scenario**

  If a web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the sandbox used to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.
* **Windows .NET applications attack scenario**

  This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a web application and a rich-client application. Like web applications, XBAPs can be published to a web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What are .NET Framework Code Access Security (CAS) Restrictions?**

The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security. Code access security (CAS) enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity. Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run. Using code access security can reduce the likelihood that your code will be misused by malicious or error-filled code. For more information on CAS, see the MSDN article, [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are three types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described as follows: systems that are using the web browsing scenario, systems that are using the web hosting scenario, and systems that are using the Windows .NET applications scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.
* **Windows .NET applications**

  Workstations and server that run untrusted Windows .NET applications are also at risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the .NET Framework validates parameters.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Verifying That** **the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
