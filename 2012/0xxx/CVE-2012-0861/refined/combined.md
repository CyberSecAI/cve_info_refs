RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

This caused the virtual machine to appear to be running in libvirt, but paused in the VDSM. Now, the evaluation occurs correctly so that the virtual machine is first re-connected to the pool before VDSM attempts to restart it. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2012-12-04 18:53:59 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

Updated fence-agents packages that fix one bug are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.

## Description

The fence-agents packages provide the Red Hat fence agents to handle remote
power management for cluster devices. The fence-agents allow failed or
unreachable nodes to be forcibly restarted and removed from the cluster.

This update fixes the following bugs:

* The speed of fencing is critical because otherwise, broken nodes have more

time to corrupt data. Prior to this update, the operation of the
fence\_vmware\_soap fencing agent was slow and could corrupt data when used on the
VMWare vSphere platform with hundreds of virtual machines. This update fixes a
problem with virtual machines that do not have a valid UUID, which can be
created during failed P2V (Physical-to-Virtual) processes. Now, the fencing
process is also much faster and it does not terminate if a virtual machines
without an UUID is encountered. (BZ#872620)

All users of fence-agents are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which fix this bug.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the Red
Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=790730#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-15 09:40:45 UTC  ``` When installing new host, RHEV-M connects to the host via ssh as root and copies vds_installer.py script into /tmp. vds_installer downloads deployUtil.py and vds_bootstrap.py via curl.  If we look into python docs [1], it clearly outlines the module search path. The first bullet says that:  "the directory containing the input script (or the current directory)."  is searched when the module to be imported is not built-in. In our case both the directory containing the input script and current directory is /tmp.    [1] <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path>  To exploit the flaw you just need to create any of the imported modules in /tmp and it gets run as root upon host installation.  Other exploit might be to pre-create /tmp/deployUtil.py, wait for vor vds_installer to download it from RHEV-M and then change the content before it's imported/executed.  Either way, copying and running python scripts from /tmp is really bad idea. Use private directory in /tmp for scripts and logs.  vds_installer also creates log files with semi-random names which are prone to symlink attacks.  A local, unprivileged user on the host to be installed/addedd to RHEV-M could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=790730#c4)  Petr Matousek    2012-12-04 08:26:56 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2 and 3.  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2 is now in Production 2 phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhev/>.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=790730#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 18:53:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2012:1508 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1508.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=790730#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 19:21:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV Manager version 3.x  Via RHSA-2012:1506 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1506.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=790730#c7)  Alon Bar-Lev    2014-03-16 20:42:56 UTC  ``` Hello,  Any reason this bug is still opened?

# RHSA-2012:1505 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor6 security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1505)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes one security issue, various
bugs, and adds enhancements is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
hosts were added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. The
Python scripts needed to configure the host for Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization were downloaded in an insecure way, that is, without
properly validating SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. An attacker
on the local network could use this flaw to conduct a man-in-the-middle
attack, potentially gaining root access to the host being added to the Red
Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. This update provides the VDSM
part of the fix. The RHSA-2012:1506 Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Manager update must also be installed to completely fix this issue.
(CVE-2012-0861)

The CVE-2012-0861 issue was discovered by Red Hat.

This updated package provides updated components that include a fix for one
security issue. This issue had no security impact on Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fix included in
this update addresses the following CVE number:

CVE-2012-0860 (VDSM issue)

This updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor package also
fixes the following bug:

* This update adds Hypervisor support for use in Red Hat Enterprise

Virtualization 3.1 compatible clusters. (BZ#846811)

This update includes:

* A fence-agents bug fix update (RHBA-2012:1439).

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-1439.html>

* An ovirt-node bug fix update (RHBA-2012:1500).

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-1500.html>

* A libvirt bug fix update (RHBA-2012:1501).

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-1501.html>

* A sanlock bug fix and enhancement update (RHBA-2012:1507).

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-1507.html>

* An important vdsm security and enhancement update (RHSA-2012:1508).

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-1508.html>

* A qemu-kvm-rhev bug fix update (RHBA-2012:1510).

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-1510.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which includes these security updates, bug
fixes and enhancements.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=876558#c0)  Dafna Ron    2012-11-14 13:10:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644816](attachment.cgi?id=644816 "logs") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644816&action=edit "logs") logs  Description of problem:  createVolume is not finished on spm when we send prepareVolume which will fail because volume does not exist yet.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  si24.1  How reproducible:  100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. create 3 domains in iscsi  2. create a template with 15GB thin provision disk and OS installed and create 20 pool vm's on one domain and 2 more vm's as clone on a second domain 3. run the vms on 2 hosts and have them write (opening explorer in the vms will be enough no need for heavy writing) 4. from vm's tab -> disks -> move each of the vm's disks to the 3ed domain    Actual results:  some of the vms fail to create the live snapshot because prepareVolume was sent to hsm before the createVolume finished creating the volume.   Expected results:  we should not send prepareVolume before confirming that createVolume completed successfully.   Additional info:logs  since there are a lot of tasks running at the same time and we already debugged here is the relevant info:   in spm log, create volume is Thread-4416:: Task is 11b6930d-5f8c-435e-9de4-46c6cc34684f  prepareVolume for same action in hsm is on Thread-4275:  this is the error with the volume that failed:   VolumeMetadataReadError: Error while processing volume meta data: ('missing offset tag on volume 710f7022-29ae-40cd-9b41-3a8a22fd8cc1',)  engine log:   this is the SnapshotVDSCommand for the vm:   2012-11-14 12:15:36,360 INFO  [org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.vdsbroker.SnapshotVDSCommand] (pool-4-thread-23) START, SnapshotVDSCommand(HostName = gold-vdsd, HostId = 2d81a26a-2c20-11e2-aeab-001a4a169741, vmId=3d393cd1-666e-4283-a2b6-ce99e74656f4), log id: 57fa069c   and here is the failure in engine log:  2012-11-14 12:15:47,105 INFO  [org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.vdsbroker.SnapshotVDSCommand] (pool-4-thread-23) FINISH, SnapshotVDSCommand, log id: 57fa069c 2012-11-14 12:15:47,105 ERROR [org.ovirt.engine.core.bll.CreateAllSnapshotsFromVmCommand] (pool-4-thread-23) Wasnt able to live snpashot due to error: VdcBLLException: VdcBLLException: org.ovirt.engine.core.vdsbroker.vdsbroker.VDSErrorException: VDSGenericException: VDSErrorException: Failed to SnapshotVDS, error = Snapshot failed, rolling back.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=876558#c1)  Allon Mureinik    2012-11-14 15:22:37 UTC  ``` Dafna, the attached engine.log only starts on 2012-11-14 12:46:48,744. Can you please attach the rotated log too?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=876558#c2)  Allon Mureinik    2012-11-14 15:27:06 UTC  ``` From the description here, it seems as though the bug is between the two components of Live Snaphots, and not nescissarily specific to Live Storage Migration   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=876558#c3)  Dafna Ron    2012-11-14 15:29:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 644960](attachment.cgi?id=644960 "engine.log.1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=644960&action=edit "engine.log.1") engine.log.1  engine log rotated - adding engine.1   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=876558#c5)  Ayal Baron    2012-11-18 19:31:52 UTC  ``` problem is a race between block volume creation and vdsm's lvm cache refresh on another host. block volume create process has 2 stages: 1. lvcreate - creates the volume 2. lvchange - adds tags with metadata  if another host refreshes its cache between 1 and 2 then it will have an incomplete lv in the cache and next time it needs the lv it will not refresh the cache.  Solution is to add an init tag in lvcreate so that other hosts would be able to identify such LVs as partial and ignore them.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=876558#c6)  Eduardo Warszawski    2012-11-18 22:19:49 UTC  ``` I40cd67e563935de663d938cbc1bc9cf152802448   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=876558#c10)  Dafna Ron    2012-11-22 16:55:51 UTC  ``` verified on si24.4 with vdsm-4.9.6-44.0.el6_3.x86_64   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=876558#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 19:14:06 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=875370#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-11-10 20:46:53 UTC  ``` It was found that Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager did not correctly pass wipe-after-delete when moving disks between storage domains. This resulted in such disks not being securely deleted as expected, potentially leading information disclosure.  Acknowledgments:  This issue was discovered by Allon Mureinik of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=875370#c1)  Petr Matousek    2012-12-04 08:28:52 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2 and 3.  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2 is now in Production 2 phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhev/>.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=875370#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 19:24:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV Manager version 3.x  Via RHSA-2012:1506 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1506.html>   ``` |  |

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1506)

## Topic

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.1 is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts were added to
the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. The Python scripts
needed to configure the host for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were
stored in the "/tmp/" directory and could be pre-created by an attacker. A
local, unprivileged user on the host to be added to the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization environment could use this flaw to escalate their
privileges. This update provides the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Manager part of the fix. The RHSA-2012:1508 VDSM update (Red Hat Enterprise
Linux hosts) must also be installed to completely fix this issue.
(CVE-2012-0860)

A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor hosts were added to the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization environment. The Python scripts needed to configure the host
for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were downloaded in an insecure way,
that is, without properly validating SSL certificates during HTTPS
connections. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to
conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially gaining root access to the
host being added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. This
update provides the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager part of the
fix. The RHSA-2012:1508 VDSM update (Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts) or
RHSA-2012:1505 rhev-hypervisor6 update (Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor hosts) must also be installed to completely fix this issue.
(CVE-2012-0861)

It was found that under certain conditions, Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager would fail to lock the screen on a virtual machine
between SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments)
sessions. A user with access to a virtual machine in Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager could potentially exploit this flaw to gain access
to another user's unlocked desktop session. (CVE-2011-4316)

It was found that Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager did not
correctly pass wipe-after-delete when moving disks between storage domains.
This resulted in such disks not being securely deleted as expected,
potentially leading to information disclosure. (CVE-2012-5516)

A flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
back end checked the privileges of users making requests via the SOAP and
GWT APIs. An authenticated attacker able to issue queries against Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager could use this flaw to query data that
they should not have access to. (CVE-2012-2696)

These issues were discovered by Red Hat.

In addition to resolving the above security issues these updated Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager packages fix various bugs, and add
various enhancements.

Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available in the
Technical Notes:

<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Technical_Notes/index.html>

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages which resolve these security issues, fix these
bugs, and add these enhancements.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=790754#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-02-15 10:44:14 UTC  ``` When installing new host, RHEV-M connects to the host via ssh as root and copies vds_installer.py script into /tmp. vds_installer downloads deployUtil.py and vds_bootstrap.py via curl.  curl is invoked with "-k" parameter:  -k/--insecure   (SSL)  This  option  explicitly  allows  curl  to  perform "insecure" SSL   connections and transfers. All SSL connections are attempted to be made secure by using the CA certificate bundle installed by default. This makes all connections considered "insecure" fail unless -k/--insecure is used.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=790754#c2)  Petr Matousek    2012-12-04 08:27:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2 and 3.  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2 is now in Production 2 phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhev/>.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=790754#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 18:53:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2012:1508 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1508.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=790754#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 19:14:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2012:1505 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1505.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=790754#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 19:21:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV Manager version 3.x  Via RHSA-2012:1506 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1506.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=790754#c6)  Wade Mealing    2014-11-06 05:33:27 UTC  ``` Closing this bug, it looks all clean.   ``` |  |

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHBA-2012%3A1439)

## Topic

Updated fence-agents packages that fix one bug are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.

## Description

The fence-agents packages provide the Red Hat fence agents to handle remote
power management for cluster devices. The fence-agents allow failed or
unreachable nodes to be forcibly restarted and removed from the cluster.

This update fixes the following bugs:

* The speed of fencing is critical because otherwise, broken nodes have more

time to corrupt data. Prior to this update, the operation of the
fence\_vmware\_soap fencing agent was slow and could corrupt data when used on the
VMWare vSphere platform with hundreds of virtual machines. This update fixes a
problem with virtual machines that do not have a valid UUID, which can be
created during failed P2V (Physical-to-Virtual) processes. Now, the fencing
process is also much faster and it does not terminate if a virtual machines
without an UUID is encountered. (BZ#872620)

All users of fence-agents are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which fix this bug.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the Red
Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

## Topic

Updated vdsm packages are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

VDSM is a management module that serves as a Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager agent on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 hosts.

A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts were added to
the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. The Python scripts
needed to configure the host for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were
stored in the "/tmp/" directory and could be pre-created by an attacker. A
local, unprivileged user on the host to be added to the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization environment could use this flaw to escalate their
privileges. This update provides the VDSM part of the fix. The
RHSA-2012:1506 Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager update must also
be installed to completely fix this issue. (CVE-2012-0860)

A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor hosts were added to the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization environment. The Python scripts needed to configure the host
for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were downloaded in an insecure way,
that is, without properly validating SSL certificates during HTTPS
connections. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to
conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially gaining root access to the
host being added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. This
update provides the VDSM part of the fix. The RHSA-2012:1506 Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager update must also be installed to
completely fix this issue. (CVE-2012-0861)

The CVE-2012-0860 and CVE-2012-0861 issues were discovered by Red Hat.

In addition to resolving the above security issues these updated VDSM
packages fix various bugs, and add various enhancements.

Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available in the
Technical Notes:

<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Technical_Notes/index.html>

All users who require VDSM are advised to install these updated packages
which resolve these security issues, fix these bugs, and add these
enhancements.
