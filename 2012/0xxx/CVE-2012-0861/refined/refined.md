{
  "CVE-2012-0861": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor hosts were added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. The Python scripts needed to configure the host for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were downloaded in an insecure way, that is, without properly validating SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially gaining root access to the host being added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.",
    "Root cause": "The vds_installer script downloads deployUtil.py and vds_bootstrap.py via curl without proper SSL certificate validation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure download of scripts.",
       "Missing SSL certificate validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack and gain root access to the host being added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack on the local network during host installation"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker must be on the same local network as the host being installed and the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. Ability to intercept network traffic and perform a MITM attack."
  },
  "CVE-2012-0860": {
    "Description": "When installing new host, RHEV-M connects to the host via ssh as root and copies vds_installer.py script into /tmp. vds_installer downloads deployUtil.py and vds_bootstrap.py via curl. To exploit the flaw you just need to create any of the imported modules in /tmp and it gets run as root upon host installation.",
    "Root cause": "The vds_installer script is copied to /tmp and executes from there. Python's module search path prioritizes the directory of the input script, which is /tmp in this case. vds_installer also creates log files with semi-random names which are prone to symlink attacks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of /tmp directory",
       "Python module search path vulnerability",
       "Insecure log file creation"
    ],
     "Impact": "A local, unprivileged user on the host to be installed/added to RHEV-M could use this flaw to escalate their privileges and achieve arbitrary code execution as root.",
    "Attack vectors": [
     "Local access to the host being installed",
       "Pre-creating malicious files in /tmp before host installation"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the host being installed/added to RHEV-M. Ability to create files in the /tmp directory."
  },
    "CVE-2012-5516": {
    "Description": "It was found that Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager did not correctly pass wipe-after-delete when moving disks between storage domains. This resulted in such disks not being securely deleted as expected, potentially leading information disclosure.",
    "Root cause": "RHEV-M does not properly pass the 'wipe-after-delete' property of disks during disk move operations",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Failure to honor the wipe-after-delete disk property."
    ],
     "Impact": "Disks are not securely deleted during move operations, leading to potential information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Disks moved between storage domains without being wiped."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Requires an attacker to gain access to the underlying storage after a disk has been moved using the affected functionality, to recover data. Requires an environment where data should have been wiped, but was not due to this bug."
  },
  "CVE-2012-2696": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the backend in the way queries were not checking privileges of the requestor. If the requestor was authenticated, he could issue queries even on data that should be accessible to admins only.",
     "Root cause": "Lack of proper privilege checks on queries issued to the backend.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient privilege checks on data queries.",
      "Unrestricted access to data based on authentication alone"
    ],
     "Impact": "Authenticated users can access data that should be restricted to administrators, leading to information disclosure.",
     "Attack vectors": [
        "Authenticated requests to the backend via the SOAP or GWT APIs."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate against the system. Knowledge of the API is required to issue queries."
