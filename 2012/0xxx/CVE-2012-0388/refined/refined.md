      "Memory Leak",
       "Improper handling of malformed H.323 messages"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause an affected device to reload or trigger memory leaks, potentially leading to system instabilities.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing malformed H.323 messages. Transit H.323 traffic is an exploit vector.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker capable of sending malformed H.323 messages to a vulnerable device."
