| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

These vulnerabilities are as follows:   + Memory Leak Associated with Crafted IP Packets   + Memory Leak in HTTP Inspection   + Memory Leak in H.323 Inspection   + Memory Leak in SIP Inspection   Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.      Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.      This advisory is available at the following link: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120328-zbfw>       Note: The March 28, 2012, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes nine Cisco Security Advisories. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the March 2012 bundled publication.       Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semi-Annual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar12.html>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products Cisco IOS devices running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS Software are affected by four vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Zone-Based Firewall. The vulnerabilities are independent of each other. Details to confirm affected configurations are provided below.  To determine whether a device is configured with Zone-Based Firewall, log in to the device and issue the **show zone security** command-line interface (CLI) command. If the output shows a member interface under a zone name, the device is vulnerable. The following example shows a device with Zone-Based Firewall rules configured on both GigabitEthernet0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/1:  ```   Router#show zone securityzone self  Description: System defined zonezone inside  Description: *** Inside Network ***  Member Interfaces:    GigabitEthernet0/0zone outside  Description: *** Outside Network ***  Member Interfaces:    GigabitEthernet0/1Router#   ``` The following sections provide more details on the specific features containing the vulnerabilities.         **Memory Leak Associated with Crafted IP Packets**   There is no specific configuration necessary for a device to be vulnerable to the memory leak associated with crafted IP packets. If the Zone-Based Firewall is configured, the device is vulnerable.      **Memory Leak in HTTP Inspection**   For the device to be vulnerable to the memory leak associated with HTTP inspection, the Zone-Based Firewall must be configured to perform HTTP inspection with the Zone-Based Firewall.      To determine whether a device is configured for HTTP inspection, enter the command **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol http**. The following example shows a vulnerable device configured with Cisco IOS Zone-Based Policy Firewall HTTP inspection:         ```   Router#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol http           Match: protocol http    ```      **Memory Leak in H.323 Inspection**   For a device to be vulnerable to the memory leak associated with H.323 inspection, the Zone-Based Firewall must be configured to perform H.323 inspection. To determine if a device is configured for H.323 inspection enter the command **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match:** **protocol h323**. If the output contains "Match: protocol h323" the device is vulnerable. The following example shows a vulnerable device configured with Cisco IOS Zone-Based Policy Firewall H.323 inspection:   ```   Router# show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol h323           Match: protocol h323   ```      **Memory Leak in SIP Inspection**   The device is vulnerable if the configuration has either a Layer 4 or Layer 7 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application-specific policy configured, and the policy is applied to any firewall zone. To determine whether a device is configured for SIP inspection enter the command **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol sip**. If the output contains "Match: protocol sip" the device is vulnerable. The following example shows a vulnerable device configured with Cisco IOS Zone-Based Policy Firewall SIP inspection:   ```   Router# show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol sip               Match: protocol sip   ```       To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>.         Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are confirmed not vulnerable:      + Cisco PIX 500 Series Firewall   + Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance   + Firewall Services Module (FWSM) for Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and 7600 Series Routers   + Virtual Firewall (VFW) application on the multiservice blade (MSB) on the Cisco XR 12000 Series Router   + Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Module   + Cisco IOS devices configured with legacy Cisco IOS Firewall support   + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco IOS XE Software   + Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module   + Context-Based Access Control (CBAC)   No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Firewalls are networking devices that control access to the network assets of an organization. Firewalls are often positioned at the entrance points of networks. Cisco IOS Software provides a set of security features that allow the configuration of a firewall policy to match an organization's requirements.       The vulnerabilities described in this advisory affect the Zone-Based Firewall feature. The Zone-Based Policy Firewall (also known as Zone-Policy Firewall or ZFW) updates the firewall configuration from the older interface-based model to a more flexible, more easily understood zone-based model. Interfaces are assigned to zones, and inspection policy is applied to traffic moving between the zones. Inter-zone policies offer considerable flexibility and granularity, so different inspection policies can be applied to multiple host groups connected to the same router interface.   More information on the Zone-Based Firewall is available at <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6441/products_feature_guide09186a008060f6dd.html>.       **Memory Leak Associated with Crafted IP Packets**      A vulnerability exists in the Zone-Based Firewall implementation in Cisco IOS Software that could allow a remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload or to trigger memory leaks that may result in system instabilities. These vulnerabilities are triggered when the device that is running Cisco IOS Software processes crafted IP packets. Only traffic destined to an IP address configured on the device can trigger the vulnerability; transit traffic is not an exploit vector.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCto89536](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto89536) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2012-1310.            **Memory Leak in HTTP Inspection**   The HTTP Inspection Engine feature allows users to configure their Cisco IOS Firewall to detect and filter HTTP connections-such as tunneling over port 80, unauthorized request methods, and non-HTTP compliant file transfers-that are not authorized within the scope of the security policy configuration.      A vulnerability exists in the implementation of the Cisco IOS Software HTTP inspection feature that could allow a remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload or to trigger memory leaks that may result in system instabilities. This vulnerability is triggered when the device that is running Cisco IOS Software processes certain HTTP messages. Transit HTTP traffic is an exploit vector.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtq36153](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq36153) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-0387.         More information on HTTP inspection is available at <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t14/feature/guide/gt_fwapc.html>.         **Memory Leak in H.323 Inspection**   H.323 is the ITU standard for real-time multimedia communications and conferencing over packet-based (IP) networks. A vulnerability exists in the implementation of the Cisco IOS Software H.323 inspection feature that could allow a remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload or to trigger memory leaks that may result in system instabilities. This vulnerability is triggered when the device that is running Cisco IOS Software processes malformed H.323 messages. Transit H.323 traffic is an exploit vector.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtq45553](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq45553) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2012-0388.         More information on H.323 inspection is available at <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/sec_data_zbf/configuration/15-2mt/fw-h323-v3v4-sup.html>.       **Memory Leak in SIP Inspection**   SIP is a popular signaling protocol that is used to manage voice and video calls across IP networks, such as the Internet. SIP is responsible for handling all aspects of call setup and termination. Voice and video are the most popular types of sessions that SIP handles, but the protocol has the flexibility to accommodate other applications that require call setup and termination. SIP call signaling can use UDP (port 5060), TCP (port 5060), or Transport Layer Security (TLS; TCP port 5061) as the underlying transport protocol.      A vulnerability exists in the implementation of the Cisco IOS SIP inspection feature that could allow a remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload or to trigger memory leaks that may result in system instabilities. This vulnerability is triggered when the device that is running Cisco IOS Software processes crafted SIP messages. Transit SIP traffic is an exploit vector.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCti46171](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCti46171) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-1315.         More information on SIP inspection is available at <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/security/configuration/guide/sec_sip_alg_aic.html>.       **Memory Leak Detection**   Detected memory leaks can be viewed using the command **show memory debug leaks chunks** in privileged EXEC mode, as shown in the following example:    Router# show memory debug leaks chunks  Adding blocks for GD... I/O memory Address Size Alloc\_pc PID Alloc-Proc Name Chunk Elements:    AllocPC Address Size Parent Name Processor memory Address Size Alloc\_pc PID Alloc-Proc Name    4733113C 188 419CB164 129 IP Input FW h225 tpkt    The previous example shows a memory leak in the process FW h225 tpkt. The **show memory debug leaks** command was introduced in Cisco IOS Software versions 12.3(8)T1 and 12.2(25)S.      Caution: All **show memory debug** commands must be used on customer networks only to diagnose the router for memory leaks when memory depletion is observed. These commands may cause high CPU utilization and may cause time-sensitive protocols to flap. These commands are recommended to be used in maintenance windows.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that mitigate the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.  Fixed Software  * `When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:L/AC:H/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:UC/CDP:N/TD:N/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |
