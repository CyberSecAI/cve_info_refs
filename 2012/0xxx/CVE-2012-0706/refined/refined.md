Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0706:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The IBM SONAS (Scale Out Network Attached Storage) system includes an LDAP client that stores the username and password of the LDAP user in clear text in the local file system.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Storage of sensitive credentials (LDAP username and password) in clear text. This constitutes a significant security vulnerability since the credentials can be accessed by any user who has file system access.
- Improper access control or lack of encryption for sensitive data stored in the local file system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the LDAP server: An attacker who gains access to the clear text credentials can use them to authenticate to the LDAP server.
- Potential compromise of other systems: Depending on the LDAP configuration, the attacker could potentially gain access to other systems or resources connected to the LDAP server.
- Data breaches: If the LDAP server holds information about users, it can be accessed by an attacker leading to data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local file system access: An attacker needs to gain access to the file system where the credentials are stored. This could involve a local user or an attacker who has gained unauthorized access through another vulnerability on the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to access the file system on the IBM SONAS system where the clear text credentials are stored. This could be achieved via a compromised account or exploiting another vulnerability.
