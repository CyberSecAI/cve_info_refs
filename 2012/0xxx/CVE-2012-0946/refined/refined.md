  "CVE-2012-0946": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Content Description": "Multiple sources describe a vulnerability in the NVIDIA graphics drivers.",
      "Relevance": "This content directly relates to CVE-2012-0946 as it details a vulnerability in NVIDIA graphics drivers."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The NVIDIA graphics drivers allowed for reconfiguration of GPUs, enabling access to arbitrary system memory.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient access control on GPU device nodes",
        "Lack of proper checks on GPU reconfiguration"
      ],
      "Impact": "A local attacker with read and write access to the GPU device nodes could exploit the vulnerability to gain root privileges.",
      "Attack Vector": "Local access to the GPU device nodes.",
       "Required Capabilities": "Read and write access to GPU device nodes, which by default is granted to all users."
    },
     "Additional Details": {
        "Affected Products": "NVIDIA graphics drivers (Geforce 8 or newer, G80 Quadro or newer, and all Tesla GPUs)",
        "Affected Operating Systems": ["Linux", "Solaris", "FreeBSD", "Ubuntu 11.10", "Ubuntu 11.04", "Ubuntu 10.04"],
       "Mitigation": "Updated drivers (295.40 or later) contain the fix. A kernel patch is available for older drivers. Applying the patch breaks the Linux CUDA debugger, which can be fixed with an updated CUDA library (available in drivers 295.40 or later)."
