{
  "CVE-2012-0001": {
    "Description": "A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Windows due to the way the kernel loads the structured exception handling tables. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the SafeSEH defense-in-depth mechanism to facilitate exploitation of other vulnerabilities.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel loads a structured exception handling table into the \"Load Configuration\" PE header during binary execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Bypass of SafeSEH security feature",
      "Improper loading of structured exception handling tables"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the SafeSEH security feature in a software application. An attacker could then use other vulnerabilities to leverage the structured exception handler to run arbitrary code.",
     "Attack vectors": [
         "Exploiting applications compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would first have to bypass the SafeSEH security feature and then take advantage of this security bypass condition to exploit another vulnerability to execute arbitrary code."
