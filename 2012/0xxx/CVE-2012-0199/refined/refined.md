The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager Express for Software Distribution 4.1.1. CVE-2012-0199 is listed alongside CVE-2012-0198.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**
The advisory details six SQL injection vulnerabilities and one ActiveX control buffer overflow, all leading to remote code execution. They are:

1.  **`soapServlet` SOAP Message Printer.getPrinterAgentKey SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root cause:** Improperly escaped user input in an SQL query within the `SoapServlet` servlet.
    *   **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection.
    *   **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to read data from the database including the SHA1 160 bits encrypted admin password. Attacker can gain admin access to upload and execute code under the SYSTEM account.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote, no authentication required.

2.  **`Isig.isigCtl.1` ActiveX Control Remote Code Execution Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root cause:** Unsafe use of `strcat` when parsing data supplied to the `RunAndUploadFile` function of the ActiveX Control.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Stack buffer overflow.
    *   **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** User interaction is required - target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

3.  **`User.updateUserValue()` SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root cause:** Improperly escaped user input in an SQL query within the `register.do` servlet.
    *   **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection.
    *   **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to update their account rights to an admin level, allowing them to upload and execute code under the SYSTEM account.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote, no authentication required.

4.  **`User.isExistingUser()` SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root cause:** Improperly escaped user input in an SQL query within the `logon.do` servlet.
    *   **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection.
    *    **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to read data from the database including the SHA1 160 bits encrypted admin password. Attacker can gain admin access to upload and execute code under the SYSTEM account.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote, no authentication required.

5.  **`Asset.getHWKey()` SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root cause:** Improperly escaped user input in an SQL query within the `CallHomeExec` servlet.
    *   **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection.
    *   **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to read data from the database including the SHA1 160 bits encrypted admin password. Attacker can gain admin access to upload and execute code under the SYSTEM account.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote, no authentication required.

6.  **`Asset.getMimeType()` SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root cause:** Improperly escaped user input in an SQL query within the `getAttachment` servlet.
    *  **Weaknesses:** SQL Injection.
    *   **Impact:** Allows remote attackers to read data from the database including the SHA1 160 bits encrypted admin password. Attacker can gain admin access to upload and execute code under the SYSTEM account.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Remote, no authentication required.

**General Impact:**
The primary impact of all vulnerabilities is remote code execution. The SQL injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to escalate privileges and ultimately execute code as SYSTEM. The ActiveX vulnerability allows execution under the context of the current user.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
For the SQL injection vulnerabilities, attackers require network access to the vulnerable server and no prior authentication is required. For the ActiveX control vulnerability, the attacker needs to trick the user into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
