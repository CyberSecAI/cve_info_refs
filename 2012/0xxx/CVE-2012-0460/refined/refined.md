{
  "CVE-2012-0460": {
    "Description": "It was found that by using the DOM fullscreen API, untrusted content could bypass the mozRequestFullscreen security protections. A web page containing malicious web content could exploit this API flaw to cause user interface spoofing.",
    "Root cause": "The `window.fullScreen` property was made writable by untrusted content when the DOM fullscreen API was enabled, bypassing the intended security protections of `mozRequestFullscreen`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of a property that should only be modifiable by trusted code.",
      "Failure to maintain expected security barriers between trusted and untrusted content when introducing new API features"
    ],
    "Impact": "User interface spoofing, where malicious content could cause unexpected fullscreen behaviors potentially tricking users into interacting with deceptive content.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious web page can use Javascript to change the value of the `window.fullScreen` property and initiate fullscreen mode without permission or a visible indicator."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious webpage. Once the page is open, the attacker does not need further interaction from the user to exploit the vulnerability."
