## PowerDNS Security Advisory 2012-01: PowerDNS Authoritative Server can be caused to generate a traffic loop

* CVE: CVE-2012-0206
* Date: 10th of January 2012
* Credit: Ray Morris of [BetterCGI.com](http://BetterCGI.com/).
* Affects: Most PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions < 3.0.1 (with the exception of 2.9.22.5 and 2.9.22.6)
* Not affected: No versions of the PowerDNS Recursor ('pdns\_recursor') are affected.
* Severity: High
* Impact: Using well crafted UDP packets, one or more PowerDNS servers could be made to enter a tight packet loop, causing temporary denial of service
* Exploit: Proof of concept
* Risk of system compromise: No
* Solution: Upgrade to PowerDNS Authoritative Server 2.9.22.5 or 3.0.1
* Workaround: Several, the easiest is setting: `cache-ttl=0`, which does have a performance impact. Please see below.

Affected versions of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server can be made to respond to DNS responses, thus enabling an attacker to setup a packet loop between two PowerDNS servers, perpetually answering each other's answers. In some scenarios, a server could also be made to talk to itself, achieving the same effect.

If enough bouncing traffic is generated, this will overwhelm the server or network and disrupt service.

As a workaround, if upgrading to a non-affected version is not possible, several options are available. The issue is caused by the packet-cache, which can be disabled by setting 'cache-ttl=0', although this does incur a performance penalty. This can be partially addressed by raising the query-cache-ttl to a (far) higher value.

Alternatively, on Linux systems with a working iptables setup, 'responses' sent to the PowerDNS Authoritative Server 'question' address can be blocked by issuing:

```
      iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dst $AUTHIP --dport 53 \! -f -m u32 --u32 "0>>22&0x3C@8>>15&0x01=1" -j DROP

```

If this command is used on a router or firewall, substitute FORWARD for INPUT.

To solve this issue, we recommend upgrading to the latest packages available for your system. Tarballs and new static builds (32/64bit, RPM/DEB) of 2.9.22.5 and 3.0.1 have been uploaded to [our download site](http://www.powerdns.com/content/downloads.html). Kees Monshouwer has provided updated CentOS/RHEL packages in [his repository](http://www.monshouwer.eu/download/3th_party/). Debian, Fedora and SuSE should have packages available shortly after this announcement.

For those running custom PowerDNS versions, just applying this patch may be easier:

```
--- pdns/common_startup.cc   (revision 2326)
+++ pdns/common_startup.cc   (working copy)
@@ -253,7 +253,9 @@
       numreceived4++;
     else
       numreceived6++;
-
+    if(P->d.qr)
+      continue;
+
     S.ringAccount("queries", P->qdomain+"/"+P->qtype.getName());
     S.ringAccount("remotes",P->getRemote());
     if(logDNSQueries) {

```

It should apply cleanly to 3.0 and with little trouble to several older releases, including 2.9.22 and 2.9.21.

This bug resurfaced because over time, the check for 'not responding to responses' moved to the wrong place, allowing certain responses to be processed anyhow.

We would like to thank Ray Morris of [BetterCGI.com](http://BetterCGI.com/) for bringing this issue to our attention and Aki Tuomi for helping us reproduce the problem.

This Advisory contains details of a Denial of Service issue within all currently used versions of the PowerDNS Authoritative Server.  We will be releasing: 	* A configuration based workaround, which might have a performance 	  penalty  	* An iptables based workaround  	* Versions 2.9.22.5 and 3.0.1 of the Authoritative Server 		As source code 		Packages (static 32 bit and 64 bit for Debian and RPM based 		Linux distributions)  	* A one-line patch that solves the issue for source based users  	* Complete details of the problem  The denial of service attack is temporary in nature, but can be performed using limited resources. There is no risk of a system compromise because of this attack.  This pre-announcement is made to allow operators to schedule a maintenance window to possibly upgrade or modify their systems.  If you anticipate requiring help upgrading your affected systems, please contact powerdns.support at netherlabs.nl.  Some more details: CVE: [CVE-2012-0206](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0206) Date: 10th of January 2012  Affects: Most PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions < 3.0.1 (with the  exception of 2.9.22.5)  Not affected: No versions of the PowerDNS Recursor ('pdns_recursor') are affected.  Severity: High Impact: Temporary denial of service Exploit: Proof of concept Risk of system compromise: No Solution: Upgrade to PowerDNS Recursor 2.9.22.5 or 3.0.1 Workaround: Several ----  I think it would be good to upgrade the EPEL package to 2.9.22.5 once it is released tomorrow to protect users of the package from this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-10 01:49:11 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 772581](show_bug.cgi?id=772581 "CLOSED ERRATA - PowerDNS DoS Vulnerability") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-10 01:53:38 UTC  ``` We don't ship PowerDNS, nor does Fedora.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-10 01:58:25 UTC  ``` Forgot that Fedora calls it pdns, not powerdns.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c4)  Ruben Kerkhof    2012-01-10 11:29:34 UTC  ``` That's why Nils opened a bug in the Fedora EPEL component, not Red Hat.  Thanks for the help, but I rather handle my own bugs myself. I opened #772581 to keep track of this in Fedora, not EPEL.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c5)  Fedora Update System    2012-01-10 13:24:29 UTC  ``` pdns-2.9.22-4.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pdns-2.9.22-4.el5>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c6)  Fedora Update System    2012-01-10 13:25:31 UTC  ``` pdns-2.9.22.5-1.el6 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 6. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pdns-2.9.22.5-1.el6>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c7)  Fedora Update System    2012-01-11 07:59:36 UTC  ``` Package pdns-2.9.22.5-1.el6: * should fix your issue, * was pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 testing repository, * should be available at your local mirror within two days. Update it with: # su -c 'yum update --enablerepo=epel-testing pdns-2.9.22.5-1.el6' as soon as you are able to. Please go to the following url: <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-EPEL-2012-0061/pdns-2.9.22.5-1.el6> then log in and leave karma (feedback).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c8)  Nils Breunese    2012-01-17 23:52:46 UTC  ``` According to <http://mailman.powerdns.com/pipermail/pdns-users/2012-January/008492.html> 2.9.22.5 introduces a crashing bug when using PowerDNS as an AXFR slave. 2.9.22.6 will be released this week to address this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c9)  Ruben Kerkhof    2012-01-18 11:05:32 UTC  ``` Thanks Nils, I didn't see that one since I'm only subscribed to pdns-devel.  I have 2.9.22.5 running in production for a week now, on 1 master and 2 AXFR slaves, and haven't seen any crashes. Just to be save, I'll refrain from pushing 2.9.22.5 and wait for the 2.9.22.6 update.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c10)  Nils Breunese    2012-01-18 11:57:12 UTC  ``` Maybe you could just apply the one-line patch to fix the denial of service vulnerability and release that?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c11)  Nils Breunese    2012-01-26 09:48:27 UTC  ``` PowerDNS 2.9.22.6 has been released:  ---- The improvements to the master/slave engine in 2.9.22.5 contained one serious bug that can cause crashes on busy setups. 2.9.22.6 fixes this crash. ----  <http://doc.powerdns.com/changelog.html#changelog-auth-2-9-22-6>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c12)  Fedora Update System    2012-02-02 09:48:17 UTC  ``` pdns-2.9.22.6-1.el6 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 6. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pdns-2.9.22.6-1.el6>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c13)  Fedora Update System    2012-02-04 01:07:45 UTC  ``` pdns-2.9.22-4.el5 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 5 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=772570#c14)  Fedora Update System    2012-02-18 21:43:25 UTC  ``` pdns-2.9.22.6-1.el6 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 6 stable repository.
