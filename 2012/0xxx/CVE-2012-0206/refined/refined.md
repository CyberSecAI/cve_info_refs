Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-0206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the PowerDNS Authoritative Server's packet-caching mechanism. Specifically, the server was not correctly checking if incoming DNS packets were responses, causing it to process responses as if they were queries. This allowed an attacker to set up a traffic loop between two or more PowerDNS servers. The vulnerability resurfaced due to the check for 'not responding to responses' being moved to the wrong place over time.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Response Handling:** The server processes DNS responses as if they were queries, leading to a potential loop.
*   **Flawed Packet Cache Logic:** The packet cache logic fails to prevent processing of responses, causing the server to perpetually answer its own or other server's responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting specific UDP packets and creating a loop, an attacker can generate a large amount of network traffic between PowerDNS servers, overwhelming the server(s) and/or the network, leading to a temporary denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted UDP Packets:** The attack is initiated using specifically crafted UDP DNS packets that trigger the server to respond to responses.
*   **Network Loop:** The vulnerability is exploited by creating a DNS response loop between two or more vulnerable PowerDNS servers, or even a single server responding to itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to one or more vulnerable PowerDNS authoritative servers.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting DNS packets that can trigger the faulty response handling in the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions prior to 3.0.1, excluding 2.9.22.5 and 2.9.22.6.
*   The PowerDNS Recursor ('pdns\_recursor') is not affected by this vulnerability.
*   A patch is provided to correct the issue in `pdns/common_startup.cc`. This patch adds a check to skip processing if the packet is a DNS response (`if(P->d.qr) continue;`).
*   Workarounds were available including disabling the packet-cache by setting `cache-ttl=0` (with a performance impact), or using an iptables rule to block responses sent to the PowerDNS server's question address.
