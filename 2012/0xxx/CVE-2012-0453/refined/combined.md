# 4.2.rc2 and 4.0.4 Security Advisory

Wednesday, Feb 22nd, 2012
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issue has been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A CSRF vulnerability in the implementation of the XML-RPC API
  when running under mod_perl could be used to make changes to
  bugs or execute some admin tasks without the victim's knowledge.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    4.0.2 to 4.0.4, 4.1.1 to 4.2rc2
Fixed In:    4.0.5, 4.2
Description: Due to a lack of validation of the enctype form
             attribute when making POST requests to xmlrpc.cgi,
             a possible CSRF vulnerability was discovered. If a user
             visits an HTML page with some malicious HTML code in it,
             an attacker could make changes to a remote Bugzilla installation
             on behalf of the victim's account by using the XML-RPC API
             on a site running mod_perl. Sites running under mod_cgi
             are not affected. Also the user would have had to be
             already logged in to the target site for the vulnerability
             to work.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=725663
CVE Number:  CVE-2012-0453

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for this issue is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of this issue.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issue at the
"References" URL.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

  https://www.bugzilla.org/download/

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)

* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Attached file

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/535.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/18.0.1025.7 Safari/535.19
Steps to reproduce:
Hello,
There is a CSRF vulnerability in Bugzilla XML-RPC. The vulnerability allows an attacker to make alterations to a bug, groups, etc.. The vulnerability is due to non-implementation of security tokens, thus allowing you to make HTTP requests, bugs and making alterations in groups.
Reproduce:
1. Log in <https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip>.
2. Open PoC.html
3. See the XML response.
4. Back to <https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip>
4. See you logouted.
Note: My PoC only make the user logged be logout.
Cheers,
Mario.

A patch for this flaw would check the "Content-Type" correctly, allows only request only if "Content-Type: text/xml".

I'm not sure that the proposed fix in [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=725663#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] CSRF vulnerability in the XML-RPC API when using mod_perl") will work; I would not like to bet on the web platform not already having, or not evolving, a way of sending POSTs of arbitrary MIME types.
Does our entire XML-RPC API not use tokens? <sigh>

this only impacts mod\_perl installations, mod\_cgi throws the following error:
Content-Type must be 'text/xml,' 'multipart/\*,' 'application/soap+xml,'
'or 'application/dime' instead of 'text/plain'

Also confirmed.
No tokens used in XMLRPC API. or JSONRPC API for that matter as that would require the client to get the bug contents before making an update similar to the web UI. We have just always
just require the user to login when making any changes either passing a valid cookie or username/password combination.

Note in passing that BzAPI does not have this problem:
[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:REST\_API#Authentication](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla%3AREST_API#Authentication)
However, it probably takes advantage of this issue in order to interact with Bugzilla on the back end!
What are the risks here? AIUI, direct data theft is not one of them, because of the same origin policy - an attacking page, unless it's on bugzilla.mozilla.org (or mozilla.org?) can't get at any returned data. But bugs can be defaced, or perhaps have group bits removed (!).
CCing mcoates: can the infrasec team give us an impact assessment, and details of best practices? Is this as bad as it seems?

For info, here's a blog post describing this technique:
<http://pentestmonkey.net/blog/csrf-xml-post-request>
We could get the XML-RPC User.login operation to return a session key in the returned hash, and then require that on every request afterwards. This would, of course, break every single client...

I'm a bit tired by these sec bugs. Why is the security of our API so badly implemented? And what's so special in mod\_perl vs mod\_cgi that only mod\_perl is affected?

Clickjacking in xmprpc.cgi + A old bug in Firefox(view-source:view-source:). May allow the exploitation of this Info-stealing easier(see 72580).

The JSON-RPC bug and this bug are most likely the result of me (or the other WebServices reviewers) not being aware that browsers could post in text/plain, and also us not being aware that browsers were sending XmlHttpRequests even though they were denying reading the responses.

I'm guessing this is some implementation complexity in either CGI.pm or SOAP::Lite.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=725663&attachment=596704)

i think for branches we'll have to whitelist the content-type, as introducing token based auth would cause much breakage.
note firefox has a whitelist of content-types that it will allow the user to set (<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/base/src/nsXMLHttpRequest.cpp#2683>) so for firefox at least this should be sufficient. i haven't had a chance yet to experiment with other browsers.Assignee: webservice → glob

Yeah, this is the same list as mentioned in [bug 718319 comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=718319#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] JSON-RPC permits to bypass token checks and can lead to CSRF (no victim's action required)"). We blacklisted them to force the browser to wait for an answer from the server, which it will never get. Probably we could do the same here, for branches.

I think that this patch is better(remove case sensitive problem, and also accept application/json).
sub deserialize {
my $self = shift;
my @types = ("text/xml","application/xml"); # XML Content types(see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML>).
foreach(@types){$content\_type = $\_;
# Only allow text/xml to protect against CSRF attacks
if (lc($ENV{'CONTENT\_TYPE'}) ne $content\_type) { # Remove case sensitive problem in MIME name.
ThrowUserError('xmlrpc\_illegal\_content\_type',
{ content\_type => $ENV{'CONTENT\_TYPE'} });
}
}
...

Also need to allow application/xml.
Make this a constant in Bugzilla/WebService/Constants.pm. There is already a
constant for JSON-RPC so you may need to rename the old one and create new XMLRPC\_CONTENT\_TYPE\_WHITELIST.

No need to pass constants to error messages. Constants are already accessible to templates, via [% constants.FOO %].

Not constants from Bugzilla/WebService/Constants.pm from what I can tell. We could definitely
patch Template.pm to do so but I would worry about naming conflicts.

Ah right, I didn't check in which file the constant was put into. :)

There should be no name conflicts between Bugzilla/Constants.pm and Bugzilla/WebService/Constants.pm as most Bugzilla/WebService/\*.pm modules load both files. So no worry about that. If a constant name would be duplicated, this would be a bug.

For trunk, you can use [% constants.XMLRPC\_CONTENT\_TYPE\_WHITELIST.join(', ') FILTER html %] to enumerate allowed MIME types. Only branches need a hardcoded text here.
Otherwise your patch looks good.

From what I can find, charset is generally not used for 'enctype' and is instead
specified in 'accept-charset'. In my testing, the browser will fall back to the default when it doesn't recognize the 'enctype' value. One example I used enctype="text/plain;charset=utf8". The browser converted the submitted 'enctype' to application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
So I feel we can just leave it as a list of accepted content-types and not use a regex.
JSONRPC is different in that the content-type is specified in the HTTP header which allows for adding charset values.

My mistake. The patch was meant for 4.2 and I did not specify in my description. I will upload the appropriate patch for trunk and the other branches.

Interestingly, 3.4 is not affected by this as far as I can tell from my testing. Reason is that XMLRPC.pm uses XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::CGI even when running under mod\_perl. So text/plain is rejected automatically by SOAP::Lite.
This is the diff of 3.4 XMLRPC.pm to trunk XMLRPC.pm:
-our @ISA = qw(XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::CGI Bugzilla::WebService::Server);
+if ($ENV{MOD\_PERL}) {
+ our @ISA = qw(XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::Apache Bugzilla::WebService::Server);

Does it mean that 3.4 is not affected \*at all\* by this issue, i.e. even when setting enctype to something else? Your answer is important because this would mean that we wouldn't need to release 3.4.15.

The problem does come from the use of XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::Apache which subclasses SOAP::Transport::HTTP::Apache. The latter uses Apache2::RequestUtil->request for obtaining the HTTP request headers. From what I can tell the request object does not have content\_type proper let which causes the SOAP code to bypass it's internal test and allows the operation to continue. If Bugzilla uses XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::CGI, it uses a standard HTTP::Request object and the content-type value is set properly. The SOAP code then sees the content-type and generates a fault response since it is not one of it's allowed content-types.
So given that, only Bugzilla releases that use XMLRPC::Transport::HTTP::Apache are affected which is currently 4.0.2 and up.
This narrows the release size a bit.

For info, here's a blog post describing this technique:

<http://www.techtrick.in>
