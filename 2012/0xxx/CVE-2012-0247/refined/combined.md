## Synopsis

Moderate: ImageMagick security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0545)

## Topic

Updated ImageMagick packages that fix three security issues and one bug are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

ImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
System that can read and write multiple image formats.

A flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed images with malformed
Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted image file that, when opened by a victim, would cause
ImageMagick to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-0247)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed images
with malformed Exif metadata. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
image file that, when opened by a victim, could cause ImageMagick to enter
an infinite loop. (CVE-2012-0248)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick decoded certain
JPEG images. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image with
specially-crafted sequences of RST0 up to RST7 restart markers (used to
indicate the input stream to be corrupted), which once processed by
ImageMagick, would cause it to consume excessive amounts of memory and CPU
time. (CVE-2012-0260)

Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting CVE-2012-0260. CERT-FI
acknowledges Aleksis Kauppinen, Joonas Kuorilehto, Tuomas Parttimaa and
Lasse Ylivainio of Codenomicon's CROSS project as the original reporters.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for Red Hat Bugzilla bug 694922, provided by the RHSA-2012:0301

ImageMagick update, introduced a regression. Attempting to use the
"convert" utility to convert a PostScript document could fail with a
"/undefinedfilename" error. With this update, conversion works as expected.
(BZ#804546)

Users of ImageMagick are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
instances of ImageMagick must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=789443#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-10 18:58:54 UTC  ``` Two input validation and denial of service flaws were reported [1],[2] in ImageMagick:  [[CVE-2012-0247](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0247)] When parsing a maliciously crafted image with incorrect offset and count in the ResolutionUnit tag in EXIF IFD0, ImageMagick copies two bytes into an invalid address. [[CVE-2012-0248](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0248)] When parsing a maliciously crafted image with an IFD whose all IOP tags' value offsets point to the beginning of the IFD itself. As a result, ImageMagick parses the IFD structure indefinitely, causing a denial of service.  The patch (noted in the upstream report) fixes the flaw in magick/property.c, which exists in Fedora's versions of ImageMagick (6.6.5 and 6.7.0) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (6.5.4), however it does not exist in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier versions of ImageMagick (6.2.8).

Package        : imagemagick
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0247 CVE-2012-0248

Two security vulnerabilities related to EXIF processing were
discovered in ImageMagick, a suite of programs to manipulate images:

CVE-2012-0247
	When parsing a maliciously crafted image with incorrect offset
	and count in the ResolutionUnit tag in EXIF IFD0, ImageMagick
	writes two bytes to an invalid address.

CVE-2012-0248
	Parsing a maliciously crafted image with an IFD whose all IOP
	tags value offsets point to the beginning of the IFD itself
	results in an endless loop and a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 8:6.6.0.4-3+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 8:6.6.9.7-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

## Description

ImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window
System that can read and write multiple image formats.

A flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed images with malformed
Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted image file that, when opened by a victim, would cause
ImageMagick to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-0247)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed images
with malformed Exif metadata. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
image file that, when opened by a victim, could cause ImageMagick to enter
an infinite loop. (CVE-2012-0248)

It was found that ImageMagick utilities tried to load ImageMagick
configuration files from the current working directory. If a user ran an
ImageMagick utility in an attacker-controlled directory containing a
specially-crafted ImageMagick configuration file, it could cause the
utility to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-4167)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way ImageMagick processed
certain Exif tags with a large components count. An attacker could create
a specially-crafted image file that, when opened by a victim, could cause
ImageMagick to access invalid memory and crash. (CVE-2012-0259)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick decoded certain
JPEG images. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image with
specially-crafted sequences of RST0 up to RST7 restart markers (used to
indicate the input stream to be corrupted), which once processed by
ImageMagick, would cause it to consume excessive amounts of memory and CPU
time. (CVE-2012-0260)

An out-of-bounds buffer read flaw was found in the way ImageMagick
processed certain TIFF image files. A remote attacker could provide a TIFF
image with a specially-crafted Exif IFD value (the set of tags for
recording Exif-specific attribute information), which once opened by
ImageMagick, would cause it to crash. (CVE-2012-1798)

Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting CVE-2012-0259,
CVE-2012-0260, and CVE-2012-1798. CERT-FI acknowledges Aleksis Kauppinen,

# ImageMagick: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201203-09**

Vulnerabilities found in ImageMagick might allow remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/imagemagick** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.7.5.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.7.5.3** |

### Background

ImageMagick is a collection of tools and libraries for manipulating
various image formats.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been found in ImageMagick:

* Incorrect offset and count values in the ResolutionUnit tag in EXIF
  IFD could cause memory corruption (CVE-2012-0247).
* IOP tag offsets pointing to the beginning of an IFD could cause an
  infinite loop of ImageMagick parsing the IFD structure (CVE-2012-0248).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image,
possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service
condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.7.5.3"

```

## Details

Joonas Kuorilehto and Aleksis Kauppinen discovered that ImageMagick

incorrectly handled certain ResolutionUnit tags. If a user or automated

system using ImageMagick were tricked into opening a specially crafted

image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or

possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=807994#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-29 10:05:53 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way ImageMagick, an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window System, decoded certain JPEG images. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image with specially-crafted values / sequences of RST0 up to RST7 restart markers (used to indicate the input stream to be corrupted), which once processed by some ImageMagick tool would lead that tool to consume excessive amount of CPU time (denial of service).  Upstream patch:  [1] <http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20629>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=807994#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:04:36 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Concerning ImageMagick 6.7.5-7 and earlier:

* [CVE-2012-0247] When parsing a maliciously crafted image with incorrect offset and count in the ResolutionUnit tag in EXIF IFD0, ImageMagick copies two bytes into an invalid address.
* [CVE-2012-0248] When parsing a maliciously crafted image with an IFD whose all IOP tags' value offsets point to the beginning of the IFD itself. As a result, ImageMagick parses the IFD structure indefinitely, causing a denial of service.

Thanks goes to the Mr Joonas Kuorilehto & Mr Aleksis Kauppinen from Codenomicon CROSS project for discovering the vulnerabilities and providing a test case file. Also to the Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority (CERT-FI) for alerting us to these vulnerabilities/

Thanks goes to security @ redhat.com for alerting us that SyncImageProfiles() is vulnerable to CVE-2012-0248.

Here are patches that repairs these vulnerabilities:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c0)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-29 10:02:49 UTC  ``` An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way ImageMagick, an image display and manipulation tool for the X Window System, retrieved Exchangeable image file format (Exif) header tag information from certain JPEG files. A remote attacker could provide a JPEG image file, with EXIF header containing specially-crafted tag values, which once opened in some ImageMagick tool would lead to the crash of that tool (denial of service).  Upstream patch: [1] <http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20629>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:03:30 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank CERT-FI for reporting this issue. CERT-FI acknowledges Aleksis Kauppinen, Joonas Kuorilehto, Tuomas Parttimaa and Lasse Ylivainio of Codenomicon's CROSS project as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:29:28 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the ImageMagick package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:41:18 UTC  ``` Public now via: [2] <http://www.cert.fi/en/reports/2012/vulnerability635606.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-29 17:43:20 UTC  ``` Created ImageMagick tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 808159](show_bug.cgi?id=808159 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-0259 CVE-2012-0260 CVE-2012-1798 ImageMagick various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c5)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-03-30 11:58:23 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the ImageMagick package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c6)  Olivier Fourdan    2012-04-02 15:23:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 574539](attachment.cgi?id=574539&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=574539&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  Updated patch, this one also adds a test to avoid an overflow of the "number_bytes" value when the "components" field is too large.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c7)  Olivier Fourdan    2012-04-03 09:57:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 574809](attachment.cgi?id=574809&action=diff "Updated (clean up) patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=574809&action=edit "Updated (clean up) patch") Updated (clean up) patch  Same proposed patch, without the traces.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c8)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-04-10 14:53:09 UTC  ``` The original patch for [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259) is insufficient. Upstream was notified and a new patch was published on [1]. As announced in [2], [CVE-2012-1610](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1610) has been assigned to the insufficient fix of [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259).  [1] <http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=20629#p82865> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/04/6>   Statement CVE-2012-1610:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of ImageMagick as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 as it did not backport the insufficient patch for [CVE-2012-0259](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0259).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c9)  Pavel Alexeev    2012-04-11 13:28:58 UTC  ``` Rawhide build which should fix it <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=3977291>.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:51:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0544 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0544.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=807993#c11)  Fedora Update System    2012-06-22 08:36:08 UTC  ``` ImageMagick-6.7.0.10-5.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
