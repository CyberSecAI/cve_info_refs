{
  "CVE-2012-0247": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw in the way ImageMagick processed images with malformed Exchangeable image file format (Exif) metadata.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of image metadata",
        "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could create a specially-crafted image file that, when opened by a victim, would cause ImageMagick to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code. A crafted image with an incorrect offset and count in the ResolutionUnit tag in EXIF IFD0 could cause ImageMagick to write two bytes into an invalid address.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A specially crafted image file"
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to create a malformed image file and entice a user to open it using ImageMagick."
