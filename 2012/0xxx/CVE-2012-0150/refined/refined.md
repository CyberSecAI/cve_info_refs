Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-0150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the `msvcrt.dll` library. Specifically, the DLL incorrectly calculates the size of a buffer in memory when handling certain data, which leads to a buffer overflow. This allows data to be copied into memory that has not been properly allocated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is a buffer overflow vulnerability, where a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user is logged in with administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system.
- **Malicious Activities:** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges if they exploit a vulnerability within an application context with different permission levels.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker could send a specially crafted media file to a user via email, and if the user opens this file, the exploit could be triggered.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker could host a website containing a specially crafted media file, or compromise legitimate websites to host the malicious content. If a user visits the site, the vulnerability could be exploited.
- **Third-Party Applications:** Any application using the vulnerable `msvcrt.dll` could be exploited by providing a specially crafted media file to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the system and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs the user to open a specially crafted file or visit a malicious webpage. This is the main hurdle in successful exploitation as the attacker cannot force this interaction. The attacker has to convince the user to interact with the malicious content.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Software:** Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2
- **Mitigation:** Users with limited user rights will be less impacted than administrative users.
- **Workarounds:** Microsoft stated that no workarounds are available for this vulnerability.
- **Patch:** The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how `msvcrt.dll` calculates the size of data structures in memory.
- **MAPP:** Microsoft provided vulnerability information to major security software providers in advance to facilitate the rapid deployment of protections by those vendors.
