Based on the provided content, here's information regarding CVE-2012-0811:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Affected Component:** PostfixAdmin versions 2.3.4 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:**
    *   SQL injection in `pacrypt()` when `$CONF[encrypt] == 'mysql_encrypt'`. The `$pw` variable was not escaped. This is used in the login form, making it available to unauthenticated users.
    *   SQL injection in `backup.php`. Database dumps were not properly escaped using `mysql_escape()`. This allowed users to inject SQL code (e.g., in the vacation message) that would be executed when the database dump was restored. Database dumps created with `backup.php` from version 2.3.4 or older may contain malicious SQL.
    *   SQL injection in `create-domain` which is only exploitable by superadmins.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   For the `pacrypt()` vulnerability, an attacker could inject SQL code via the login form.
    *   For the `backup.php` vulnerability, an attacker could inject SQL code into the database (e.g., via a vacation message) and then create a backup. When the backup is restored, the injected SQL code would be executed.
    *   For the `create-domain` vulnerability, a superadmin could inject SQL code when creating a domain.
*   **Impact:**
    *   The SQL injection in `pacrypt()` could allow unauthenticated attackers to compromise the system.
    *   The SQL injection in `backup.php` could allow attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code that would be executed when the backup is restored, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized access.
    *   The SQL injection in `create-domain` could allow superadmins to compromise the system.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to PostfixAdmin version 2.3.5 or later.
*   **Credits:** Filippo Cavallarin found most of the vulnerabilities. Matthias Bethke found the `create-domain` SQL injection.
