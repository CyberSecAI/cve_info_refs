## Safari 6.0

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A cross-site scripting issue existed in the handling of feed:// URLs. This update removes handling of feed:// URLs.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-0678 : Masato Kinugawa

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may cause files from the user's system to be sent to a remote server

  Description: An access control issue existed in the handling of feed:// URLs. This update removes handling of feed:// URLs.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-0679 : Aaron Sigel of vtty.com

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Passwords may autocomplete even when the site specifies that autocomplete should be disabled

  Description: Password input elements with the autocomplete attribute set to "off" were being autocompleted. This update addresses the issue by improved handling of the autocomplete attribute.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-0680 : Dan Poltawski of Moodle

* **Safari Downloads**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Opening maliciously crafted files on certain websites may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: An issue existed in Safari's support for the 'attachment' value for the HTTP Content-Disposition header. This header is used by many websites to serve files that were uploaded to the site by a third-party, such as attachments in web-based e-mail applications. Any script in files served with this header value would run as if the file had been served inline, with full access to other resources on the origin server. This issue is addressed by downloading resources served with this header, rather than displaying them inline.
