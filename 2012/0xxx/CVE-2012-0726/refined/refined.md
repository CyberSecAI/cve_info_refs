- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) enables NULL-MD5 and NULL-SHA ciphers in the default Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of NULL-MD5 or NULL-SHA ciphers. These ciphers provide no encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unencrypted communications, leading to potential exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the network.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, where an attacker can intercept and read the unencrypted communication between the client and the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable IBM TDS server.
