Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-0393:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary issue stems from the way Apache Struts 2 handles parameters, specifically how OGNL (Object-Graph Navigation Language) expressions are processed.
*   The `ParameterInterceptor` and `CookieInterceptor` do not properly filter or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious OGNL expressions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Remote Command Execution via `ExceptionDelegator` (Struts <= 2.2.3):**
    *   When an exception occurs during parameter assignment (e.g., assigning a string to an integer property), the input value is treated as an OGNL expression.
    *   This allows attackers to execute arbitrary Java code, including system commands.
2.  **Remote Command Execution via `CookieInterceptor` (Struts <= 2.3.1):**
    *   The `CookieInterceptor` does not apply the same parameter name whitelist as the `ParameterInterceptor`.
    *   Attackers can set the `allowStaticMethodAccess` flag to `true` via cookies and execute arbitrary system commands.
3.  **Arbitrary File Overwrite via `ParameterInterceptor` (Struts <= 2.3.1):**
    *   Although direct access to `allowStaticMethodAccess` is blocked, attackers can access public constructors that accept a String and setters that accept a string.
    *   This allows the creation of arbitrary Java objects and manipulate them, such as `FileWriter` objects, and overwrite files.
4.  **Remote Command Execution via `DebuggingInterceptor` (Struts <= 2.3.17):**
    *   The `DebuggingInterceptor`, when enabled in developer mode, allows the execution of arbitrary OGNL expressions specified via a "debug" parameter.
    *   This can be abused to achieve remote command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary system commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Attackers can create and overwrite files on the server, which can be used for various malicious purposes (e.g., web shell deployment).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST Parameters:** Malicious OGNL expressions can be injected via URL parameters or form data.
*   **HTTP Cookies:** Specifically, the `CookieInterceptor` vulnerability uses HTTP cookie names to execute code.
*   **Debugging Interface:** When developer mode is enabled, the `DebuggingInterceptor` can be exploited through the `debug` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the vulnerable Struts application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers need to be aware of the vulnerability and how to craft malicious OGNL expressions.
*   **No Authentication Required:** These vulnerabilities can typically be exploited without authentication, making them highly dangerous.
