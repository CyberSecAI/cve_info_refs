Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox and other Mozilla products construct the `Origin` header in HTTP requests when dealing with IPv6 addresses. Specifically, when an IPv6 address contained two or more consecutive 16-bit fields of zeroes, the browser would compress the address, which could lead to an ambiguous representation when a non-standard port was used. This ambiguity would then lead to a bypass of origin access controls on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Ambiguous Origin Header:** The browser generated an `Origin` header that did not uniquely identify the source when an IPv6 address with consecutive zero fields was used in conjunction with a non-standard port. This was because the browser did not enclose the IPv6 address within square brackets in the Origin header.
- **Bypass of Access Controls:** This could be used to bypass server-side access control lists (ACLs) that relied on exact matching of IPv6 literals.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially bypass origin access controls on a server if the server's ACLs used IPv6 literals and if the server was listening on a non-standard port.
- The attacker could potentially perform unauthorized cross-site requests if the target server relied on the faulty `Origin` header to implement access controls.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack requires an attacker to make cross-site HTTP requests from a page where the server is accessed with an IPv6 address containing at least 2 consecutive 16-bit fields of zeroes and a non-standard port.
- The attacker relies on the target server to have an ACL based on the malformed `Origin` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have a web server listening on a non-standard port.
- The attacker needs to control the code initiating the HTTP request (e.g., using Javascript running in the victim's browser).
- The target server needs to be using IPv6 literals in its access control lists.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Simone Fabiano.
- The fix involved ensuring that IPv6 literals in `Origin` headers are enclosed in square brackets.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 12, SeaMonkey 2.9, and Thunderbird 12.
- The severity of the vulnerability was rated as moderate ("sg:moderate").
- The fix was implemented by moving the host/port concatenation logic to `nsNetUtils` and ensuring both `nsContentUtils` and `nsHttpHandler` used this method.
- The issue was that `nsStandardURL::GetHost` stripped out the square brackets, which were required for IPv6 literals in the `Origin` header as per the specifications.
- The vulnerability was related to how Firefox constructed `Origin` headers for cross-site XHR or WebSocket requests.
- The fix also addressed a similar issue with `Sec-WebSocket-Origin` headers.
