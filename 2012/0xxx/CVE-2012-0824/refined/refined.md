  "CVE-2012-0824": {
    "description": "gnusound 0.7.5 has format string issue",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `gui_yes_no` and `gui_alert` functions in `src/gtk2/gui_dialogs.c` use a format string vulnerability. The `message` variable, which can contain arbitrary content including file names, is passed directly as the format string to `gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons`. This allows an attacker to control the format string used, leading to potential issues.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Format String Vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit the format string vulnerability to achieve various impacts, including: denial of service (DoS), arbitrary code execution, or information disclosure, depending on the specific formatting characters provided within the filename.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious file with a specially crafted file name that includes format string specifiers. When a victim opens the sound file, the filename is passed to the vulnerable functions within the application, triggering the format string vulnerability.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to entice a victim into opening a specially crafted sound file using the vulnerable gnusound application."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
      "gnusound version 0.7.5"
    ],
    "patch_details": {
      "solution": "The vulnerability was fixed by adding '%s' as a format string specifier before the message string within the gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons function.",
       "patch_commit": "The provided patch introduces the '%s' format string specifier before passing the message to gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons in the gui_yes_no and gui_alert functions. This prevents format string specifiers from being interpreted.",
       "fixed_version": "gnusound version 0.7.5-3+squeeze1"
    },
