The provided content relates to CVE-2012-0355.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the implementation of Cisco ASA syslog message 305006. Specifically, the Cisco ASA reloads when this specific syslog message is generated. This syslog message is generated when the ASA is unable to create a network address translation for a new connection.

**Weakness:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Cisco ASA handles the generation of syslog message ID 305006. When this specific message is triggered, the device reloads due to a flaw in the software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit can cause a denial of service by triggering a device reload. This disrupts network connectivity and could lead to downtime.

**Attack Vector:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this by sending a sequence of packets that trigger the generation of syslog message 305006. The vulnerability can be exploited using IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall modes, in single and multi-context configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the Cisco ASA device to trigger the generation of syslog message 305006. The attacker does not need any form of authentication. They only need to send traffic that triggers the generation of the vulnerable log message by the ASA.
