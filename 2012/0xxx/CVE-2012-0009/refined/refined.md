Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0009:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improperly registered and implemented Windows Object Packager within affected versions of Microsoft Windows. Specifically, it involves how Windows registers and uses the Object Packager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Executable Launching:** The Windows Object Packager is vulnerable to launching arbitrary executables from an untrusted source due to the incorrect way it is registered. This allows an attacker to potentially execute malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Complete Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Share/UNC/WebDAV:** An attacker can place a legitimate file with an embedded packaged object alongside a malicious executable in a network share, UNC path, or WebDAV location.
- **User Interaction Required:** The user must be tricked into opening the legitimate file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Position:** The attacker does not need to be on the local machine; they can exploit the vulnerability remotely via a network share, UNC path, or WebDAV share.
- **Ability to Place Files:** The attacker must be able to place a specially crafted executable and a legitimate file with an embedded malicious object in a location accessible to the target user.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Mitigation:** Disabling the WebClient service and blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall are recommended workarounds. Registering packager.exe with a full path in the registry is also advised.
*   **Affected Systems:** Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are affected. Windows Vista, Windows 7, and later are not affected.
*   **Patch:** Microsoft released a security update to address this vulnerability by correcting a registry key associated with the Windows Object Packager.
