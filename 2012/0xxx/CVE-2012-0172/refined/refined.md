Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-0172:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, specifically when accessing a deleted object related to VML (Vector Markup Language) styles. This improper handling leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free:** The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability. Internet Explorer attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed with Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites, including those that accept user-provided content or advertisements, to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Email-Based Attack:** Although less direct, attackers could embed a malicious ActiveX control (marked as "safe for initialization") in an application or Microsoft Office document, if the application or document hosts the IE rendering engine, to trigger the vulnerability. Users would need to open the document or application.
- **Social Engineering:** In all scenarios, the attacker has to convince the user to visit the attacker's website or open a malicious document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to host a website with specially crafted content.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious website or opening a malicious document.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attack can be carried out remotely, without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8, across various Windows versions, with varying severity levels (Critical on client OSes and Moderate on Server OSes).  Internet Explorer 9 is only affected by other vulnerabilities fixed in the same update, not this one.
- The vulnerability is mitigated by Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers, but only for sites not added to the Trusted Sites Zone.
- Workarounds are available, including setting security zones to "High" or disabling Active Scripting, but these measures may impact website functionality.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or actively exploited before the release of the security update.
- Microsoft has credited an anonymous researcher from TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this vulnerability.
