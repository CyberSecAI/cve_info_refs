{
  "CVE-2012-0815": {
    "description": "Multiple flaws were found in the way RPM parsed package file headers. An attacker could create a specially-crafted RPM package that, when its package header was accessed, or during package signature verification, could cause an application using the RPM library (such as the rpm command line tool, or the yum and up2date package managers) to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of negated offsets in the headerVerifyInfo() function within the RPM library, where a numeric range comparison was done without checking for minimum values, allowing an attacker to bypass bounds.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Integer overflow",
          "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could create a specially crafted RPM package that, when read, could cause RPM to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code prior to the verification of the digital signature.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves a malicious or specially-crafted RPM package file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and deliver a malicious RPM file to a system using the affected RPM library."
