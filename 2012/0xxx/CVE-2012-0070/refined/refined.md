Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the TLS implementation within `spamdyke` not properly clearing transport layer buffers when transitioning from plaintext to ciphertext after receiving the `STARTTLS` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper buffer handling during the STARTTLS handshake.
- Failure to clear plaintext data from the buffer before initiating TLS encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Command Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary plaintext data, such as SMTP commands, within the same packet as the `STARTTLS` command.
- **Execution of Injected Commands:** These injected commands are then executed by the server after the TLS connection is established, bypassing the intended security measures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending malicious crafted network packets to a vulnerable `spamdyke` server.
- The attack occurs during the initial plaintext phase of a connection using STARTTLS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable `spamdyke` server.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to craft network packets, specifically those containing a `STARTTLS` command and additional plaintext data.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of `spamdyke` prior to 4.2.1.
- The fix involves discarding buffered input after TLS is started.
- The issue was reported by Eric Shubert.
- The Gentoo bug tracker entry provides a good summary.
