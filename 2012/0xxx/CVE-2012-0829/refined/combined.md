Subject: Re: XSS hiding CSRF (was: Re: Mibew messenger multiple XSS)

I agree with you, this issues should have been categorized as CSRF. I had this doubt when reporting them and i decide to consider them XSS for one main reason: even with a CSRF protection an operator is still able to inject javascript into visitor's browser (ie an operator sets chat title to XSS and it gets executed when new visitor opens a chat). But propably you are rignt, there is no gain for an admin to exploit this and, for sure you are right, a password reset has a bigger impact.

Regards,
Filippo Cavallarin

It's standard operating procedure - and has been for many years - to particularly pay attention to these "XSS hiding CSRF" cases. For that reason you'll often see discrepancies in the original report and the released Secunia advisories.

However, via the CSRF vector it can be exploited by non-admins. This is why the Secunia advisory is rated as CSRF (like the OSVDB advisory) and just mentions XSS as a follow-up impact (along with alternatively just changing the administrator's password and gain full access that way).
>
> I would definitely join Steve in encouraging researchers to keep this trend in mind by considering a) if a discovered issue actually provides a gain compared to legitimately accessible functionality and b) relies on another vulnerability in order to be an issue. We encounter these "XSS hiding CSRF" cases on a weekly basis.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
