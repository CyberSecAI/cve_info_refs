Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0829:

**Summary:**

The content discusses a vulnerability in Mibew messenger, initially reported as an XSS issue, but later reclassified as a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability with XSS as a resultant impact. The core issue is that administrative functionalities, such as banning a user or changing settings, could be triggered by an attacker using CSRF. While the application might be vulnerable to XSS within administrative panels, this XSS is not directly exploitable without a CSRF attack first, meaning that the main vulnerability is CSRF.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of CSRF protection on administrative functions within Mibew messenger.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **CSRF:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper CSRF tokens or checks on administrative endpoints, allowing an attacker to make requests on behalf of a logged-in administrator.
    *   **XSS (Resultant):** While not the core issue, XSS vulnerabilities exist in the administrative panel, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript. However, these XSS issues are generally not exploitable without first leveraging a CSRF vulnerability to make the admin perform actions that inject the javascript. An admin could inject JavaScript using their legitimate administrative privileges.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker could force an administrator to perform actions without their knowledge. This could include changing settings, banning users, or other administrative tasks.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the visitor's browser when a new visitor opens a chat or when the administrator views the chat logs.
    *   **Password Reset:** The impact of the CSRF vulnerability could include an attacker resetting the administrator's password, gaining full access to the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., a crafted POST form) and tricks a logged-in administrator into submitting it. This can be achieved through social engineering tactics like sending a link via email or embedding it into a malicious website.
    *   **XSS:**  Once CSRF is used to trick an admin into performing an action like changing the chat title, malicious javascript can be injected. This javascript will then be executed when visitors view the altered title.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted request (e.g., through a malicious link or website). They do not need any valid credentials for the Mibew application to perform this.
    *   **XSS:** This is a resultant issue that requires the successful exploitation of the CSRF vulnerability. Once a CSRF attack is successful, the attacker may inject malicious javascript.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The discussion highlights a trend where researchers report XSS vulnerabilities in admin modules, without accounting for the fact that the XSS is only exploitable via CSRF.
*   The Secunia advisory correctly identifies the issue as a CSRF vulnerability, with XSS being a secondary impact.
*   The content includes the initial report from Filippo Cavallarin, as well as discussion from security researchers such as Carsten Eiram and Steven M. Christey on the classification of the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2012-0829 is primarily a CSRF vulnerability in Mibew messenger which could be leveraged to perform administrative actions, and in some instances inject malicious Javascript.
