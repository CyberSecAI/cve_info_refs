```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `uname()` system call with the `UNAME26` personality set, did not correctly handle the buffer size when copying the kernel release string to user space, leading to a kernel stack information leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper bounds checking when copying data from kernel space to user space."
    ],
    "impact": "A local unprivileged user can read kernel stack memory, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access: By calling the `uname()` syscall with the `UNAME26` personality set."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires local access and the ability to make system calls.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `override_release` function within `kernel/sys.c`. The fix involves initializing the stack buffer, calculating the correct length for the copy operation, and ensuring that the len argument is treated as an unsigned size_t."
