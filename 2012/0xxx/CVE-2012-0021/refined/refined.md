{
  "CVE-2012-0021": {
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod_log_config module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP request with a malformed Cookie header.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The mod_log_config module does not properly handle a '%{cookiename}C' log format string when a cookie lacks both a name and value, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the httpd child process.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a malformed Cookie header when the '%{cookiename}C' log format string is in use.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the server. They do not need to be authenticated. The server needs to have cookie logging enabled in its configuration."
