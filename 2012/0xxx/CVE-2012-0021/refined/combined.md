RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the Apache HTTP Server component for JBoss Enterprise Web
Server 1.0.2 that fixes multiple security issues and one bug is now
available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to

".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### important: ap\_find\_token() Buffer Overread ([CVE-2017-7668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7668))

The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap\_find\_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap\_find\_token() to return an incorrect value.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Dominic Scheirlinck and Scott Geary of Vend for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### moderate: mod\_dav crash ([CVE-2013-6438](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-6438))

XML parsing code in mod\_dav incorrectly calculates the end of the string when removing leading spaces and places a NUL character outside the buffer, causing random crashes. This XML parsing code is only used with DAV provider modules that support DeltaV, of which the only publicly released provider is mod\_dav\_svn.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: APR apr\_palloc heap overflow ([CVE-2009-2412](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2412))

A flaw in apr\_palloc() in the bundled copy of APR could cause heap overflows in programs that try to apr\_palloc() a user controlled size. The Apache HTTP Server itself does not pass unsanitized user-provided sizes to this function, so it could only be triggered through some other application which uses apr\_palloc() in a vulnerable way.

### moderate: mod\_proxy crash ([CVE-2007-3847](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3847))

A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod\_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:05:13 UTC  ``` A flaw [1] was found in mod_log_config.  If an administrator configured the "%{cookiename}C" log format string to be used, a remote attacker could send a specific cookie which would cause a crash.  This crash would only be a denial of service if using a threaded MPM (such as event or worker).  Note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora use the prefork MPM by default.  This will be fixed upstream [2] in 2.2.22 and affects versions 2.2.17 up to and including 2.2.21.

This issue did not affect the versions of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:07:02 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 785067](show_bug.cgi?id=785067 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2012-0021 httpd: crash in mod_log_config [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-28 06:13:13 UTC  ``` ====================================================== Name: [CVE-2012-0021](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0021)  The log_cookie function in mod_log_config.c in the mod_log_config module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.17 through 2.2.21, when a threaded MPM is used, does not properly handle a %{}C format string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a cookie that lacks both a name and a value.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-29 17:32:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c0)) > This will be fixed upstream [2] in 2.2.22 and affects versions 2.2.17 up to and > including 2.2.21.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2012

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2012

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 87 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle’s use of CVRF is available at: </security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF>.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or proof of concept code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1455387.1](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=70267263072071&id=1455387.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=70335995559268&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1455387.1](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=70267263072071&id=1455387.1 ) for further details regarding the On Request patches.

### Appendix - Oracle Database Server

#### Oracle Database Server Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for the Oracle Database Server divided as follows:

* 4 new security fixes for the Oracle Database Server.  3 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Database Server installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle-Database-Server).
* 1 new security fix for Oracle Application Express Listener.  This vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle Application Express Listener).
* 2 new security fixes for Oracle Secure Backup.  Both of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle Secure Backup).

Please note that on April 30, 2012, Oracle released [Security Alert CVE-2012-1675](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2012-1675.html). This Security Alert provides mitigation instructions against the publicly disclosed "TNS Listener Poison Attack." Because of the nature of this issue (amount of code change required, potential for significant regression issues, and inability to automate the application of a fix), Oracle does not plan to backport a permanent fix for this vulnerability in any upcoming Critical Patch Update. Customers are therefore strongly advised to implement the recommendations set forth in the [Security Alert](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2012-1675.html).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A1329)

## Topic

Updated httpd and httpd22 packages that fix one security issue are now
available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4, 5, and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

A flaw was found in the way the Apache HTTP Server handled Range HTTP
headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the Apache HTTP
Server to use an excessive amount of memory and CPU time via HTTP requests
with a specially-crafted Range header. (CVE-2011-3192)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 should upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
After installing the updated packages, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users
must restart the httpd22 service, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
users must restart the httpd service, for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:27:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the default error response for status code 400.  This could be used by an attacker to expose "httpOnly" cookies, when no custom ErrorDocument was specified.  This affects all versions of Apache from 2.2.0 up to and including 2.2.21.  It will be fixed upstream in 2.2.22 (via r1235454 [1]).  [1] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1235454>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:33:29 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 785070](show_bug.cgi?id=785070 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2012-0053 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0021 CVE-2011-3607 httpd: multiple vulnerabilities [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-28 06:13:41 UTC  ``` ====================================================== Name: [CVE-2012-0053](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0053)  protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-29 14:52:53 UTC  ``` Upstream fix (linked in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)) changes the amount of information sent back to an HTTP client when httpd detects one of the following problems:  1) HTTP request header line is longer than configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds the line (actually, a prefix of it read before reaching the limit) to its default 400 error page.  2) HTTP request header line is continuation of the previous line and both lines combined together exceed configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds previous line to its default 400 error page.  Note: previous line here may refer to a concatenation of more than one line, if previous lines were continuations too.  3) HTTP request header line does not contain : , which is a separator between the header name and its value.  Case 1) is the one that can be used by malicious javascript to gain access to httpOnly cookies.  A script can set additional cookies to make Cookie: request header line length exceed LimitRequestFieldSize and read values of a httpOnly protected cookies from the httpd's error page.  This may allow a script injected via some XSS flaw to gain access to cookies it can not access directly.  Upstream fix ensures that error page only contains header name, or 80 character prefix of the header name, if the name exceeds that limit.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-02-01 08:20:33 UTC  ``` Write up of the issue for the original reporter:   <http://fd.the-wildcat.de/apache_e36a9cf46c.php>  It confirms the analysis above ([comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c10)  Denis    2012-02-20 14:29:13 UTC  ``` Is httpd-2.2.3-53  impacted by the issue httpd-2.2.3-53 ?

Hi Blair,   We are working towards addressing of this issue in various versions of JBoss Enterprise Web Server too. But unfortunately as of right now we are unable to provide exact release date, when the updates can be expected (as the final date is subject of change depending on couple of internal conditions).  Hope the above being sufficient and helpful. Apologize, but can't provide more exact information.  Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2012-03-09 15:28:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects httpd packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, which are now in the Extended Life Phase of their life cycle. Therefore this issue is not planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c24)  Mark J. Cox    2012-04-05 08:45:37 UTC  ``` Note that this issue does affect Apache 2.0 despite the Mitre CVE description.

It should also be noted that this is not an issue by itself.  This can only be exploited via some other cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw found in a web application running on the server and may allow injected JavaScript to gain access to HttpOnly cookies, if the application uses this protection for its cookies.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:27:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the default error response for status code 400.  This could be used by an attacker to expose "httpOnly" cookies, when no custom ErrorDocument was specified.  This affects all versions of Apache from 2.2.0 up to and including 2.2.21.  It will be fixed upstream in 2.2.22 (via r1235454 [1]).  [1] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1235454>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:33:29 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 785070](show_bug.cgi?id=785070 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2012-0053 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0021 CVE-2011-3607 httpd: multiple vulnerabilities [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-28 06:13:41 UTC  ``` ====================================================== Name: [CVE-2012-0053](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0053)  protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-29 14:52:53 UTC  ``` Upstream fix (linked in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)) changes the amount of information sent back to an HTTP client when httpd detects one of the following problems:  1) HTTP request header line is longer than configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds the line (actually, a prefix of it read before reaching the limit) to its default 400 error page.  2) HTTP request header line is continuation of the previous line and both lines combined together exceed configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds previous line to its default 400 error page.  Note: previous line here may refer to a concatenation of more than one line, if previous lines were continuations too.  3) HTTP request header line does not contain : , which is a separator between the header name and its value.  Case 1) is the one that can be used by malicious javascript to gain access to httpOnly cookies.  A script can set additional cookies to make Cookie: request header line length exceed LimitRequestFieldSize and read values of a httpOnly protected cookies from the httpd's error page.  This may allow a script injected via some XSS flaw to gain access to cookies it can not access directly.  Upstream fix ensures that error page only contains header name, or 80 character prefix of the header name, if the name exceeds that limit.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-02-01 08:20:33 UTC  ``` Write up of the issue for the original reporter:   <http://fd.the-wildcat.de/apache_e36a9cf46c.php>  It confirms the analysis above ([comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c10)  Denis    2012-02-20 14:29:13 UTC  ``` Is httpd-2.2.3-53  impacted by the issue httpd-2.2.3-53 ?

John, it has been resolved now via RHSA-2012:0323.  Previously it was vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c15)  bmorriso    2012-02-27 16:34:48 UTC  ``` Hi,  Any information on that status of the EWS fixes for this CVE?   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c17)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-07 15:50:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c15)) > Hi, >  > Any information on that status of the EWS fixes for this CVE?  Hi Blair,   We are working towards addressing of this issue in various versions of JBoss Enterprise Web Server too. But unfortunately as of right now we are unable to provide exact release date, when the updates can be expected (as the final date is subject of change depending on couple of internal conditions).  Hope the above being sufficient and helpful. Apologize, but can't provide more exact information.  Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2012-03-09 15:28:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects httpd packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, which are now in the Extended Life Phase of their life cycle. Therefore this issue is not planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c24)  Mark J. Cox    2012-04-05 08:45:37 UTC  ``` Note that this issue does affect Apache 2.0 despite the Mitre CVE description.  Verification: <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.0.x/STATUS?view=diff&r1=1237164&r2=1237165&pathrev=1237165>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c27)  Coty Sutherland    2012-05-01 16:43:10 UTC  ``` Are we making any kind of progress on this for EWS 1.0.2 (tomcat 6.0.32)?   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c28)  Coty Sutherland    2012-05-01 16:47:20 UTC  ``` Sorry, this isn't a tomcat issue, I meant to inquire about EWS 1.0.2's Apache (2.2.17)...   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:51:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:0543 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0543.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 19:17:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0542.html>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c32)  Tomas Hoger    2012-07-27 07:15:59 UTC  ``` Mitigation instructions:  As noted in the original reporter's advisory (see [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c5)), this issue can be mitigated by using a custom ErrorDocument setting, such as:    ErrorDocument 400 "Bad Request"    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#errordocument>  It should be noted that ErrorDocument setting using path or external URL does not mitigate this issue.   It should also be noted that this is not an issue by itself.  This can only be exploited via some other cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw found in a web application running on the server and may allow injected JavaScript to gain access to HttpOnly cookies, if the application uses this protection for its cookies.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785065#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:05:13 UTC  ``` A flaw [1] was found in mod_log_config.  If an administrator configured the "%{cookiename}C" log format string to be used, a remote attacker could send a specific cookie which would cause a crash.  This crash would only be a denial of service if using a threaded MPM (such as event or worker).  Note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora use the prefork MPM by default.  This will be fixed upstream [2] in 2.2.22 and affects versions 2.2.17 up to and including 2.2.21.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=52256#c0)  Rainer Canavan    2011-11-28 15:16:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 27993](attachment.cgi?id=27993&action=diff "Patch (check NULLness of name before use)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=27993&action=edit "Patch (check NULLness of name before use)") Patch (check NULLness of name before use)  Last Friday, a SAMSUNG-GT-S5230 stumbled across one of our servers and sent the following Cookie Header (truncated):  Cookie: =; facdd=1; facdp=240#947; facdo=portrait  Since we do log one cookies on this specific server via a LogFormat with NAME=\"%{COOKIENAME}C\", this caused a segfault in apr_collapse_spaces, called from log_cookie. In log_cookie(), name is set to NULL for the nameless and valueless cookie, which causes just about everything in the following block to segfault.  (Line numbers don't align with stock httpd 2.2.21 due an unrelated custom patch in log_env_var()).  #0  apr_collapse_spaces (dest=0x0, src=0x0) at strings/apr_cpystrn.c:220 220	    while (*src) { (gdb) bt #0  apr_collapse_spaces (dest=0x0, src=0x0) at strings/apr_cpystrn.c:220 #1  0x000000000046b4a4 in log_cookie (r=0xcac1790, a=0xaf048d0 "COOKIENAME") at mod_log_config.c:561 #2  0x000000000046ab94 in process_item (r=<value optimized out>, cls=0x9ffdde8, default_format=<value optimized out>) at mod_log_config.c:976 #3  config_log_transaction (r=<value optimized out>, cls=0x9ffdde8, default_format=<value optimized out>) at mod_log_config.c:1039 #4  0x000000000046acb3 in multi_log_transaction (r=0x0) at mod_log_config.c:1070 #5  0x00000000004363ea in ap_run_log_transaction (r=0xcac1790) at protocol.c:1696 #6  0x00000000004a9e5c in ap_process_request (r=0xcac1790) at http_request.c:308 #7  0x00000000004a69e0 in ap_process_http_connection (c=0xb45c1b0) at http_core.c:190 #8  0x000000000044e21a in ap_run_process_connection (c=0xb45c1b0) at connection.c:43 #9  0x00000000004e1330 in child_main (child_num_arg=<value optimized out>) at prefork.c:667 #10 0x00000000004e1741 in make_child (s=0x86e4710, slot=38) at prefork.c:771 #11 0x00000000004e1fb8 in ap_mpm_run (_pconf=<value optimized out>, plog=<value optimized out>, s=<value optimized out>) at prefork.c:906 #12 0x000000000042fae6 in main (argc=3, argv=0x7fff3072ecc8) at main.c:739 (gdb) up #1  0x000000000046b4a4 in log_cookie (r=0xcac1790, a=0xaf048d0 "COOKIENAME") at mod_log_config.c:561 561	            apr_collapse_spaces(name, name); ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=52256#c1)  Mina Galić    2011-11-28 15:33:09 UTC  ``` Doesn't that mean that if the name is now empty you don't escape the value either? - Or am I misreading this? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=52256#c2)  Rainer Canavan    2011-11-28 16:31:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=52256#c1)) > Doesn't that mean that if the name is now empty you don't escape the value > either? - Or am I misreading this?  I assume you are misreading the patch. If the name is empty, nothing will be returned for this cookie, the return ap_escape_logitem() is never called. Instead, the while loop simply proceeds with the next cookie. If no other cookie matches, NULL is returned at the exit of the function. Cookies with empty names are illegal according to rfc2109, so there's no need to consider the case that someone might want to log such things with %{}C. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=52256#c3)  Stefan Fritsch    2011-12-28 23:18:40 UTC  ``` trunk: [r1225380](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1225380) 2.4: [r1225385](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1225385) ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=52256#c4)  Takashi Sato    2012-01-26 13:54:48 UTC  ``` backported to 2.2: [r1227292](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1227292)  And Assigned as CVE-2012-0021 ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=52256#c5)  Stefan Fritsch    2012-02-04 20:52:15 UTC  ``` 2.2.22 is released ``` |  |

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0542)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
now available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1329 update

introduced a regression in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects this regression. (BZ#749071)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 should upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
After installing the updated packages, users must restart the httpd
service for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A1329)

## Topic

Updated httpd and httpd22 packages that fix one security issue are now
available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4, 5, and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

A flaw was found in the way the Apache HTTP Server handled Range HTTP
headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the Apache HTTP
Server to use an excessive amount of memory and CPU time via HTTP requests
with a specially-crafted Range header. (CVE-2011-3192)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 should upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.
After installing the updated packages, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 users
must restart the httpd22 service, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6
users must restart the httpd service, for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
