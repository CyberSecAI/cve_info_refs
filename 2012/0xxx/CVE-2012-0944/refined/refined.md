Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-0944:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an error in `aptdaemon.core.TransactionQueue.put()`. This error causes transactions to be queued and applied before they are simulated. `Aptdaemon` only checks for unauthenticated packages during the simulation of a transaction. Normally `aptdaemon` should simulate every transaction before it is queued, even if the client hasn't explicitly called the Simulate method of the transaction before (e.g. update-manager and software-center don't simulate the transactions).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Transaction Handling:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly simulate transactions before they are processed, specifically related to the handling of unauthenticated packages.
- **Missing Security Checks:** A crucial security check (verification of package authenticity) is bypassed when transactions are not simulated, because the check is only performed during the simulation phase.
- **Unauthenticated Package Installation:** This allows for the installation of altered/malicious packages without the expected authentication checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Installation of altered packages:** An attacker could potentially trick Aptdaemon into installing altered packages.
- **Compromised System:** By installing malicious software, an attacker could gain control over the system, steal sensitive information, or cause other forms of damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-middle:** An attacker could potentially intercept and modify packages during download.
- **Compromised Repository:** An attacker could also compromise a software repository and inject malicious packages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need the ability to intercept or modify network traffic (man-in-the-middle) or otherwise control or influence the source of the packages being installed.
- **Knowledge of Exploitable Package Managers:** The attacker would need to target systems using `aptdaemon` and understand the vulnerability's mechanics.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability affects `aptdaemon` versions in Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty), 11.10 (Oneiric) and Precise.
- The fix involves two key actions:
  1.  Re-checking for unauthenticated packages directly before applying changes.
  2.  Fixing the automatic simulation of transactions.
- Patches were released to address the vulnerability in affected Ubuntu releases, specifically for `python-aptdaemon` packages.
- The provided patches modify the `aptdaemon/worker.py` file to properly handle unauthenticated packages and ensure the simulation occurs before the actual installation.
