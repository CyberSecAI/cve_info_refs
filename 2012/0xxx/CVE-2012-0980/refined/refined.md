Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `download.php` script of the phux Download Manager application. The vulnerability exists because user-supplied input to the `file` parameter in the `download.php` URL is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is Blind SQL injection. This type of SQL injection is where the attacker is unable to see the result of their query directly, instead relying on timing or other side-channels to infer information.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to database information, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and the underlying system if database credentials are exposed. Sensitive data stored in the database could be stolen.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `download.php`. The attacker includes malicious SQL code within the `file` parameter of the URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges or prior access is necessary.
