Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0155:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, specifically when accessing a deleted object related to Vector Markup Language (VML). This improper handling leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper object handling in memory.
- Accessing a deleted object leading to memory corruption.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the logged-on user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control over the system, including installing software, modifying data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised or user-content hosting websites.
- **ActiveX controls:** Attackers could embed malicious ActiveX controls marked as "safe for initialization" within an application or Microsoft Office document that uses the IE rendering engine.
- **Email/IM:** Attackers could use phishing or malicious links in emails or instant messages to lure users to visit a malicious site or open a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host or inject malicious code into a website or application that a user will access using Internet Explorer.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website or open the document.
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability through web-based attack or by embedding malicious content in documents.
