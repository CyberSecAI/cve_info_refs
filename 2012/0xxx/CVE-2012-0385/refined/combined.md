How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  **Access Vector**  ---   Local (L) A vulnerability exploitable with only local access requires the attacker to have either physical access to the vulnerable system or a local (shell) account. Examples of locally exploitable vulnerabilities are peripheral attacks such as Firewire/USB DMA attacks, and local privilege escalations (e.g., sudo). Adjacent Network (A) A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. Examples of local networks include local IP subnet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, and local Ethernet segment.  Network (N) A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". An example of a network attack is an RPC buffer overflow.  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  **Access Complexity**  ---   High (H)  Specialized access conditions exist. For example: In most configurations, the attacking party must already have elevated privileges or spoof additional systems in addition to the attacking system (e.g., DNS hijacking). The attack depends on social engineering methods that would be easily detected by knowledgeable people. For example, the victim must perform several suspicious or atypical actions. The vulnerable configuration is seen very rarely in practice. If a race condition exists, the window is very narrow. Medium (M)  The access conditions are somewhat specialized; the following are examples: The attacking party is limited to a group of systems or users at some level of authorization, possibly untrusted. Some information must be gathered before a successful attack can be launched. The affected configuration is non-default, and is not commonly configured (e.g., a vulnerability present when a server performs user account authentication via a specific scheme, but not present for another authentication scheme). The attack requires a small amount of social engineering that might occasionally fool cautious users (e.g., phishing attacks that modify a web browser?s status bar to show a false link, having to be on someone?s ?buddy? list before sending an IM exploit).  Low (L)  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. The following are examples: The affected product typically requires access to a wide range of systems and users, possibly anonymous and untrusted (e.g., Internet-facing web or mail server). The affected configuration is default or ubiquitous. The attack can be performed manually and requires little skill or additional information gathering. The ?race condition? is a lazy one (i.e., it is technically a race but easily winnable).  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  **Authentication**  ---   Multiple (M) Exploiting the vulnerability requires that the attacker authenticate two or more times, even if the same credentials are used each time. An example is an attacker authenticating to an operating system in addition to providing credentials to access an application hosted on that system. Single (S) The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop session or web interface).  None (N) Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  **Confidentiality Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. Partial (P) There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. An example is a vulnerability that divulges only certain tables in a database.  Complete (C) There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed. The attacker is able to read all of the system's data (memory, files, etc.)  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  **Integrity Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the integrity of the system. Partial (P) Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. For example, system or application files may be overwritten or modified, but either the attacker has no control over which files are affected or the attacker can modify files within only a limited context or scope.  Complete (C) There is a total compromise of system integrity. There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire system being compromised. The attacker is able to modify any files on the target system.  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete  **Availability Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the availability of the system. Partial (P)There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. An example is a network-based flood attack that permits a limited number of successful connections to an Internet service.  Complete (C) There is a total shutdown of the affected resource. The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable.    Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.

The vulnerability is triggered when an affected device processes a malformed Smart Install message on TCP port 4786.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround may be available in some versions of Cisco IOS Software if the Smart Install feature is not needed.  This advisory is available at the following link: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120328-smartinstall>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsDevices configured as a Smart Install client or director are affected by this vulnerability. To display Smart Install information, use the **show vstack config** privileged EXEC command on the Smart Install director or client. The outputs of **show** commands are different when entered on the director or on the client. The following is the output of **show vstack config** in a Cisco Catalyst Switch configured as a Smart Install client: ```   switch#show vstack config Role: Client Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.163      ```  The following is the output of **show vstack config** in a Cisco Catalyst Switch configured as a Smart Install director:  ```   Director# show vstack configRole: Director Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.163 Vstack Mode: Basic Vstack default management vlan: 1 Vstack management Vlans: none Vstack Config file: tftp://10.1.1.100/default-config.txt Vstack Image file: tftp://10.1.1.100/c3750e-universalk9-tar.122- Join Window Details:         Window: Open (default)         Operation Mode: auto (default) Vstack Backup Details:         Mode: On (default)         Repository: flash:/vstack (default)   ```  A device that has the Smart Install feature enabled, either as a director or as a client, has TCP port 4786 in the open state. The command **show tcp brief all | include 4786** can be used to determine if TCP port 4786 is open (and therefore, to determine if Smart Install is enabled). The following example shows the output from **show tcp brief all | include 4786** on a device that has the Smart Install feature enabled:  ```   router# show tcp brief all | include 4786   47DFD528  0.0.0.0.4786                *.*                         LISTEN      ```    The Smart Install feature is enabled by default on devices that can be configured to act as Smart Install directors or Smart Install clients. These devices are LAN switches (Cisco Catalyst Switches), and the default configuration is to enable Smart Install with a client role. The Smart Install feature is disabled by default on devices that can act only as Smart Install directors. These devices are typically routers and the feature is disabled by default because it requires additional configuration that is not necessary in the case of Smart Install clients.  To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.  No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Smart Install is a plug-and-play configuration and image-management feature that provides zero-touch deployment for new LAN Ethernet switches. This feature allows, for example, new LAN switches to be deployed at new locations without any configuration. A vulnerability exists in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device. Smart Install uses a Cisco proprietary protocol that runs over TCP port 4786. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to establish a TCP session on port 4786 of an affected device that has the Smart Install feature enabled, and then send a malformed Smart Install message. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtt16051](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtt16051) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only), and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-0385.  Workarounds  * In some versions of Cisco IOS Software, the Smart Install feature can be disabled with the global configuration command **no vstack**. In versions of Cisco IOS Software where this command is available, the vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the Smart Install feature if it is not needed.  **Note**: The **no vstack** global configuration command to disable Smart Install was introduced with the fix for Cisco bug [CSCtj75729](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729) ("Ability to shut Smart Install default service on TCP port 4786"). If a Cisco IOS Software release supports the Smart Install feature but the **no vstack** command does not exist, the release does not contain the fix for Cisco bug [CSCtj75729](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729).  In versions of Cisco IOS Software that support only the Smart Install director functionality, Smart Install can be disabled with the **no vstack basic** global configuration command. This command also mitigates the vulnerability in cases where disabling Smart Install is operationally feasible.  If the Smart Install feature cannot be disabled because of operational constraints or because the **no vstack** command is not available, there are no workarounds. In this case, the only mitigation is to prevent TCP connections from untrusted sources to port 4786 on affected devices. Administrators can use the following mitigations on affected devices:    + Interface access control lists (ACLs)   + Control Plane Policing (CoPP; not available on all Cisco IOS Software releases) Administrators can use the following mitigations on other devices in the network:    + Infrastructure access control lists (iACLs)   + VLAN access control lists (VACLs) For information about additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in the network, including iACLs and VACLs, refer to the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) companion document for this advisory, which is available at the following location: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20120328-smartinstall>.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, also consult <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.   In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance.    Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2012 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release, where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.
