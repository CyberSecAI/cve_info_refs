  "CVE-2012-0787": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the current 0.10.0 version and most previous versions of Augeas. It requires that the directory containing the file to be edited is writable by another user, so this needs the user to explicitly open a file in another location or for a file in a default location to be in a group/world writable directory. This attack hinges on behaviour to support writing to a bind mount when the rename fails with EBUSY or EXDEV. Augeas instead opens the file and writes straight into it, see transform.c in clone_file when copy_if_rename_fails is set from transform_save.",
    "Root cause": "Augeas did not properly handle bind mounts during file saving operations, leading to a vulnerability when the rename operation failed. It would proceed to open and write to the file at the target location instead of ensuring it's a regular file and not a mountpoint.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of bind mounts.",
      "Failure to verify if the target file is a regular file and not a mount point during save operations.",
      "Insecure file handling when rename operations fail."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with write access to a directory containing a file managed by Augeas could perform a mount point attack, potentially overwriting arbitrary files or leaking information by mounting a file at the target location.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to a directory containing files managed by Augeas.",
        "Manipulating bind mounts or file system mounts"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to create bind mounts or file system mounts",
      "Write access to the directory containing files managed by Augeas."
      ]
  }
