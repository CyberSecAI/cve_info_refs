# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# **[CVE-2012-0037](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2012-0037)**

### Vulnerabilità di sottrazione di dati in OpenOffice.org

#### PericolositÃ : Significativa

#### Fornitore: The Apache Software Foundation

#### Versioni affette dal problema:

* OpenOffice.org 3.3 e 3.4 Beta, su tutte le piattaforme.
* PuÃ² interessare anche versioni precedenti.

#### Descrizione:

Descrizione: Ã possibile un attacco di tipo entità esterna XML (XXE) alle
sopracitate versioni di OpenOffice.org. Questa vulnerabilità sfrutta
il modo in cui vengono processate delle entità esterne in alcuni componenti
XML nei documenti ODF. Utilizzando una entità esterna che fa riferimento
ad altre risorse del file system, un attaccante sarebbe in grado di inserire i
contenuti di altri files accessibili localmente in un documento ODF, senza che
l'utilizzatore ne sia a conoscenza o abbia autorizzato questa operazione.
In questo modo quando quel documento viene inoltrato ad altri, i dati potrebbero
essere rubati.

#### Soluzione

Gli utilizzatori di OpenOffice.org 3.3.0 e 3.4 beta possono aggiornare la loro
installazione con le seguenti patch. Effettuare il download, estrarre i file e
seguire le istruzioni indicate nel file readme.pdf incluso (in inglese) o nella
sua [traduzione italiana](CVE-2012-0037.pdf).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This allows Turtle to read and parse files much larger than the system memory; it splits the inputs after the end of a turtle "sentence" that ends in a `.`. Includes memory usage minimizing with AVLTree pruning during serializing and addition of turtle serializer flush implementation.

It added utility functions for re-entrant sorting of objects and sequences and a few other useful methods.  Issues Fixed:   * [0000574](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=574): Language tags with underscore * [0000575](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=575): Wrong API or wrong API documentation * [0000576](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=576): Wrong assert for a counted string being nul terminated * [0000577](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=577): iri parsing does not conform to REC-n-quads-20140225 * [0000579](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=579): raptor\_world\_generate\_bnodeid accepts world not parser * [0000581](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=581): My patch for parser and serializers count * [0000584](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=584): raptor fails to parse trig files with dos line endings  Parser changes Fixed `raptor_grddl_filter_triples()` check for three URIs which has been broken since 2007 but just did more work. Found via gcc5 warning.  The TRiG parser now accepts \r newlines between the graph name and the following '{'. Fixes [Issue #0000584](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=584)  Turtle, TRiG, N-Triples and N-Quads parsers now check escapes correctly for URI strings. \t \b \n \r \f are forbidden. Check that raw ' ' or \u0020, \u003C or \u003E are also not accepted. Fixes [Issue #0000577](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=577)  N-Triples / N-Quads parsers nwo accept '\_' as an alias for '-' in lang strings. '\_' is not legal. Fixes [Issue #0000574](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=574)  Updated RDFa parser (librdfa) to support full URLs for `typeof` from upstream. Re-checked several tests which have been passing for some time but the expected output was not a correct conversion from the testsuite sparql. Serializer changes Turtle serializer now writes `()` instead of `rdf:nil` via [Pull Request #16](https://github.com/dajobe/raptor/pull/16) from Richard H. McCullough. Thanks! I/O-stream class changes `raptor_iostream_decimal_write()` and `raptor_iostream_hexadecimal_write` now return non-0 if they do not succeed in writing successfully. Fixes [Issue #0000575](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=575) Term class changes `raptor_new_term_from_blank()` now also accepts "" as the same as a NULL blank node ID argument. URI class changes Fixed `raptor_uri_counted_filename_to_uri_string()` to use the passed in len, not look for end NUL char and count lengths. Fixes [Issue #0000576](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=576).  `raptor_new_uri_from_counted_string()` no longer assumes a NUL terminated string. Remove a debug assert and use `fwrite()` to emit the counted URI string to the debug file handler.  Fixed `raptor_uri_normalize_path()` to check the size of output buffer is big enough. Writer class changes Fixed `raptor_turtle_writer_quoted_counted_string()` to use the passed in length, drop the `strlen()` call and use the length internally. Fixes [Issue #0000576](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=576). World class changes Added `raptor_world_get_parsers_count()` and `raptor_world_get_serializers_count()` with patch from Victor Porton. Thanks! Fixes [Issue #0000581](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=581). Other Changes Made raptor work with Travis CI again; have to download and install Bison 3.  Added `raptor_sort_r()` and `raptor_sequence_sort_r()` re-entrant sort utility methods based on the public domain [sort\_r](https://github.com/noporpoise/sort_r) code by Isaac Turner.  Ensure `raptor_locator_format()` always adds a NUL to terminate the output string.  Fix a -99 <= var <= 99 timezone interval check. Thanks to Richard Trieu for the report.  Improve configure warning check using AC\_LANG\_WERROR  Use C99 `__FUNCTION__` replacing `__func__` from C90.  Improve build-time flex and bison output to be more silent.  Added Intel C compiler (icc) support from Sebastian Freundt (hroptatyr on GitHub) - Thanks. Raptor2 2.0.14 changes Many code quality fixes from clang and coverity primarily in error path cleanups (out of memory cases) and dead code. Parser changes Turtle 1.1 parser: fixes about triple quoting alignment with SPARQL from the www-rdf-comments list post REC [report of problem](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-comments/2014Feb/0018.html) and [expected answer](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-comments/2014Feb/0021.html). Other changes Fixed RDFa 1.0 and RDFa 1.1 test suites to properly report failures.  Updated the fix-flex and fix-bison scripts to remove dead code that clang and coverity complain about. Raptor2 2.0.13 changes Issues Fixed:   * [0000562](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=562): N-Quads parsing of URIs with ' fails  Parser changes The N-Triples / N-Quads parser was updated to allow ' in URIs. Fixes [Issue #0000562](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=562). Configuration changes Use the discovery of the `xml2-config(1)` / `curl-config(1)` programs as test for presence of the libraries. This fixes the issue where that after configuring, curl was present but was not used for WWW fetching. This is seen when the output of `curl-config --cflags` is empty / whitespace.  Updated to use the `AC_CHECK_PROGS` macro to find jing since `AC_CHECK_PROG` doesn't default to setting it as found when present! Internal changes The Turtle and parsedate parsers and the turtle lexer were updated to use and require Bison 3.0.0.  The JSON and turtle writers were updated to save several expensive `strlen()` calls. Raptor2 2.0.12 changesParser changes The N-Triples / N-Quads parser was updated to pass all the two test suites for the updated specifications:   * [RDF 1.1 N-Triples - A line-based syntax for an RDF graph](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-n-triples-20131105/), W3C Candidate Recommendation, 05 November 2013 (aka N-Triples 2013) * [RDF 1.1 N-Quads - A line-based syntax for an RDF datasets](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-n-quads-20131105/), W3C Candidate Recommendation, 05 November 2013   The main fixes were:   * allow `\b` and `\f` escapes (from Turtle, SPARQL) * fix the allowed blank node identifier characters * require all URIs to be absolute * handle a single short document with no end of line * support NULs inside literals * handle unescaped newlines inside literals  Term class changes Added `raptor_new_term_from_counted_string()` to create a term from a Turtle or N-Triples string syntax. This is the opposite of `raptor_term_to_turtle_counted_string()` and `raptor_term_to_turtle_string()` and also reads the strings created by `raptor_term_to_counted_string()` and `raptor_term_to_string()`. Raptor2 2.0.11 changes Issues Fixed:   * [0000556](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=556): Problem with relative URI in rdf:about, rdf:resource etc. * [0000554](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=554): RDF/XML serializer does not canonicalize attribute order in XMLLiterals  Parser changes N-Triples parser was updated to support all of [RDF 1.1 N-Triples - A line-based syntax for an RDF graph](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-n-triples-20131105/) (aka N-Triples 2013) It now supports `# comments` after the end of lines, checks for illegal unicode escapes, checks for bad URIs and checks language tags. Also removed support for legacy N-Triples `"foo"-LANGTOKEN`. Many internal changes were also made.  RDF/XML parser fixed the XML Canonicalization so that it writes the XML attributes in sorted order. Fixes [Issue #0000554](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=554). URI class changes Added `raptor_uri_uri_string_is_absolute()` to check if a URI is absolute. QName class changes Added `raptor_qname_format_as_xml()` to turn a qname into an XML declaration. Configuration and build changes Restructured code to build an internal librdfa convenience library (never installed) so that newer automake will stop moaning about subdir-objects.  `configure` now checks for clang to correctly find supported warnings.  Various portability and build fixes (Daniel Richard G)  Build fixes: `make check` will now work if jing is not installed (for feed XML generation validation). Other changes Fixed a few issues found with LLVM 3.4 (SVN) run with address sanitizing. Raptor2 2.0.10 changes Issues Fixed:   * [0000532](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=532): configure.ac: required file `src/raptor\_config.h.in' not found * [0000535](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=535): configure accepts bogus values for --with-xml2-config * [0000545](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=545): Reopen issue 503 * [0000548](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=548): xml:lang inside rdf:parseType="Literal" are removed in parsed output  Parser changes Turtle parser was updated to handle [Turtle Terse RDF Triple Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-turtle-20130219/) W3C Candidate Recommendation 19 February 2013 (Turtle 2013) The main changes were to align with SPARQL-style blank node names, prefixes and local names.  N-Triples parser was updated to handle [N-Triples - A line-based syntax for an RDF graph](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-n-triples-20130409/) W3C Working Group Note 09 April 2013 (N-Triples 2013) The main changes were to allow \b \f, UTF-8 in strings and URIs and the SPARQL-style blank node names.  RDF/XML parser updated to understand the new RDF 1.1 datatypes: rdf:HTML and rdf:langString Serializer changes Updated N-Triples and Turtle serializers (via writers) for 2013 versions based on SPARQL 1.1 definitions. These new formats have incompatible changes.  Added functions for writing escaped Turtle / N-Triples terms:  ```  int raptor_string_escaped_write(const unsigned char *string,   size_t len, const char delim, unsigned int flags, raptor_iostream *iostr);  int raptor_term_escaped_write(const raptor_term *term, unsigned int flags,   raptor_iostream* iostr);  int raptor_uri_escaped_write(raptor_uri* uri, raptor_uri* base_uri,   unsigned int flags, raptor_iostream *iostr);  ```  These uses the new new `raptor_escaped_write_bitflags` enum bitflag values for the `flags` argument.  Deprecated `raptor_string_python_write()` for `raptor_string_escaped_write()` with flags. Configuration and build changes `configure` now recommends flex 2.5.36  `configure` was updated to switch configuring libxml and libcurl to use the `PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG` and `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` macros. The preference remains to prefer looking for the xml2-config and curl-config programs before trying pkg-config unless `--with-curl-config=no` `--with-xml2-config=no` are used.  `configure` now dies if xml2-config or xslt-config point at non executable files. Patch from Michael Stahl - thanks. Fixes [Issue #0000534](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=535)  `configure` now adds curl or libxml pkg-config requires only if they were found via pkg-config; this prevents unnecessary dependency on pkg-config files if they are not needed.  Updated autogen.sh and code to handle variations of header macro. Fixes [Issue #0000532](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=532) Raptor2 2.0.9 changes Issues Fixed:   * [0000499](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=499): Turtle parser fails to correctly parse valid syntax * [0000508](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=508): Raptor objects to possibly valid Turtle syntax * [0000520](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=520): compilation failure * [0000521](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=521): Python RDF 1.0.14.1 segfault when one tries to parse xhtml+rdf using the RDFa parser * [0000526](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=526): Document how to find gtkdocize in INSTALL.html  Parser Changes RDFa parser: Handle non-namespaced elements without crash in RDFa. Fixes [Issue #0000521](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=521)  Turtle Parser: Added full support for [Turtle Terse RDF Triple Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-turtle-20130219/) W3C Candidate Recommendation 19 February 2013  This includes accepting new keywords from SPARQL (`BASE` and `PREFIX`), triples forms and details of the characters allowed in URIs, Literals, Prefix Names, Local Names and Blank Node identifiers. Some existing documents that used `\`-escapes in URIs to encode characters not allowed in URIs, are now forbidden. For example ASCII 32 (0x20) - space, which should be written as `%20`. Serializer changes Turtle Serializer: Added full support for [Turtle Terse RDF Triple Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-turtle-20130219/) W3C Candidate Recommendation 19 February 2013 which particular effects the encoding of URIs in the serializer. Configuration and build changes Added CMake build framework for building Raptor on Microsoft Windows. Removed the old `win32/` area and `win32_raptor_config.h` references. Contributed by Daniel Richard G. for Teragram Inc.  Ensure that a small system BUFSIZ does not affect parser guessing Patch from Daniel Richard G for Teragram Inc.  Added a compile-time check for `raptor_world_guess_parser_name()` to ensure that `RAPTOR_READ_BUFFER_SIZE` is at least as large as `FIRSTN`, because otherwise the guesser sees fewer than `FIRSTN` bytes from the document. Patch from Daniel Richard G for Teragram Inc.  Update `configure` to allow xml2-config and curl-config to work for libxml and libcurl. It now report on the source of xml, curl libraries in the configuration status.  `autogen.sh` updates to abort the run if a configuring program fails, Generate NEWS with old timestamp if missing so automake can run.  Handle the libxml2 `ret->checked` field not being present in older libxml2 versions. The entities checked field was added 2006-10-10 in [libxml2 GIT commit a37a6ad91a61d168ecc4b29263def3363fff4da6and](http://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=a37a6ad91a61d168ecc4b29263def3363fff4da6and) released in libxml2 2.6.27 on 2006-10-25. Fixes [Issue #0000520](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=520) Other changes `raptor_www_set_ssl_verify_options()` now supports the Curl 7.28.1 removal of `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST` with a value of 2. Now `verify_host` non-0 means to verify CN, 0 means to not verify.  Remove `-m MODE` from the `rapper(1)` help message which was removed in commit f94fa561db05b21132b14a2b72f05b77e666c252 on Wed Apr 28 21:31:54 2010 -0700 as part of the Raptor V2 work. Raptor2 2.0.8 changes Issues Fixed:   * [0000381](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=381): Raptor incorrectly serializes turtle lists when list nodes are URIs. * [0000487](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=487): Does raptor\_world\_guess\_parser\_name [librdf\_parser\_guess\_name2] ever return NULL? * [0000505](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=505): Parsing certain escaped unicode strings in Turtle cases an error * [0000507](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=507): Turtle parse error causes fatal error  Parser class changes Guessing a parser with `raptor_world_guess_parser_name()` now returns NULL failure when the guess is very poor, rather just return the first bad result. Fixes [Issue #0000487](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=487) which was reported in [Redland librdf](https://librdf.org/) but is implemented here.  Guess parser: now returns error file and line location information from the guessed parser.  RDFa parser: Updated [librdfa](https://github.com/rdfa/librdfa) to the latest GIT supporting [RDFa 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-rdfa-core-20120607/) with 30 tests still not passing - mostly issues in the core librdfa. Made several resilience and crash fixes. Updated the RDFa 1.0 test suite to latest tests and made fixes. The RDFa parser now accepts aliases 'rdfa10', 'rdfa11' and the default 'rdfa' is RDFa 1.1  RSS tag soup parser: Use `time()` when `gettimeofday()` is not available. Fix several reference leaks.  RDF/XML parser: The range of RDF/XML entity recognizing heuristic was broadened to allow recognition of documents produced by Stanford's Protege software (and possibly others). Fixed some parser memory leaks / double frees.  Turtle parser: Do not report multiple errors for Turtle string decoding problems. When a Turtle qname cannot be found, a fatal error is no longer generated but a regular error message giving information on the qname that failed (usually due to unknown prefix). Fixes [Issue #0000507](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=507) SAX2 API changes `raptor_sax2_inscope_xml_language()` will now return "" for explicit no language (`xml:lang=""`) as well as NULL for undefined language (no `xml:lang` present). Serializer class changes Turtle: Do not emit a Turtle `(...)` collection if the list item is a URI. This fixes [Issue #0000381](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=381). Term class changes Added `raptor_term_to_turtle_counted_string()` counted string form of `raptor_term_to_turtle_string`. Unicode class changes `raptor_unicode_utf8_string_put_char()` and `raptor_unicode_utf8_string_get_char()` now allow reading / writing U+D800 to U+DFFF (UTF-16 surrogates). rather than returning failure. BOMs remain forbidden - definitely not UTF-8. Fixes [Issue #0000505](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=505) URI class changes Fixed URI resolving with reference (relative) URIs that are bare queries like '?y' with no path. Now matches the specification RFC3986 section 5.4.1 Normal Examples.  Added `raptor_new_uri_relative_to_base_counted()` to construct URI relative to current base.  Added `raptor_uri_to_turtle_counted_string()` counted string form of `raptor_uri_to_turtle_string`. WWW class changes The Curl WWW implementation now interprets `Content-Location`code> header as absolute or relative URI. Configuration and build changes All configure --with-foo options now handle --without-foo (and --with-foo=no) to disable attempting to find the value in the PATH. This can be used with --with-xml2-config, --with-xslt-config, --with-curl-config, --with-icu-config and --with-libwww-config where the value 'no' or --without-foo can be used to disable it and prevent automatic searches for the config script in the PATH.  The `-DRAPTOR_DEBUG` and `-DMAINTAINER_MODE` flags are now written to the config header instead of added to CPPFLAGS.  The `-g` flag is no longer added to CFLAGS or CPPFLAGS with `--enable-debug`.  The existing `--disable-release` (default) now correctly removes -O options in flag variables for the maintainer.  `autogen.sh` now looks for the environment variable `NOCONFIGURE` to prevent it running configure at the end of the auto generation run.  The `configure` vsnprintf() check was made more comprehensive. Other changes Multiple portability improvements to vsnprintf code and macros. Also fixed uninitialized variable problems in non-c99 variant of raptor\_vsnprintf2(). Thanks to John Emmas for reporting.  Multiple portability fixes for building out of the source tree. Out of source tree 'make check' and 'make dist' should both work. Thanks to Daniel Richard G. for the patches.  Multiple portability fixes for building on old Solaris versions. Thanks to Daniel Richard G. for the patches.  Multiple portability fixes for building on Windows including strcasecmp(), windows headers, configuration fixes, parsedate code, URI test builds, vsnprintf building. Thanks to Daniel Richard G. for the patches.  Updated the example `rdfguess` to accept a file called or no arguments to read from stdin. Raptor2 2.0.7 changes CVE-2012-0037 fixed  Issues Fixed:   * [0000448](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=448): Turtle parser does not return error status from turtle\_parse\_chunk() * [0000469](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=469): Allow rapper to bypass server SSL certs checks in libcurl   Removed Expat support since expat has not had a release in years and libxml2 works well. This allows some code simplification. Updated `configure` so that if Raptor is configured with no parser that requires an XML parser, libxml2 will not be required.  Removed internal Unicode NFC checking code used for checking RDF/XML literals conformance which was expensive to check and a large of compiled-in static dataset that was rather out of date. Replaced with optional compiled use of [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org"). If ICU is not explicitly configured, no literal checking is done. Options changes Added new options:  `RAPTOR_OPTION_NO_FILE` Deny file requests during parsing. Enabled by default. `RAPTOR_OPTION_LOAD_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES` Allow loading of XML external entity loading. Disabled by default. `RAPTOR_OPTION_WWW_SSL_VERIFY_PEER` Controls verifying an SSL peer during parsing / WWW. Takes an integer value: non-0 to verify peer SSL certificate (default 1). `RAPTOR_OPTION_WWW_SSL_VERIFY_HOST` Controls verifying an SSL host during parsing / WWW. Takes an integer value: 0 none, 1 CN match, 2 host match (default). Other values are ignored. Parser class changes The RDF/XML, RSS Tag Soup and RDFa parsers now pass on network, file and entity loading parser options to the internal SAX2 to enable enforcing of network, file and entity loading policy.  RDF/JSON parser handles an API change between YAJL V1 and V2.  Turtle parser now returns parser errors to `raptor_parse_chunk()`. Fixes [Issue #0000488](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=488) SAX2 class changes Added `raptor_sax2_set_uri_filter()` to set a URI filter for any SAX2 calls that do internal lookups of URIs.  Control file and network loading inside SAX2. Option `RAPTOR_OPTION_LOAD_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES` now enforces loading external XML entities and is by default enabled. If enabled, `RAPTOR_OPTION_NO_FILE` and `RAPTOR_OPTION_NO_NET` are also checked. All URIs loaded are also passed through any URI filter, if set by `raptor_sax2_set_uri_filter()`. URI class changes Added new URI constructor `raptor_new_uri_from_uri_or_file_string()` to build a URI from a URI string or a filename string, normalizing the result to a `file:` URI.  Added `raptor_uri_uri_string_to_counted_filename_fragment()` to turn a URI string to a filename and URI fragment along with string output string counts.  Added utility methods for checking if a file: URI or filename is a file that exists: `raptor_uri_file_exists()` and `raptor_uri_filename_exists()` WWW class changes Added `raptor_www_set_ssl_verify_options()` to set SSL verify options. Fixes [Issue# 0000469](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=469).  The `raptor_www_fetch()` call now returns the status from any URI filter that returns a non-0 response. Build changes Added `--with-icu-config=`*PATH* option to enable use of ICU for NFC checking.  Requires automake 1.11.2+ for `-Wextra-portability`  `configure` uses `AM_PROG_AR` to make automake `-Wextra-portability` happy. Raptor2 2.0.6 changes Fixed expat support which was broken in 2.0.5  Handle libCurl SSL options before 7.16.4 (that's 2007) since old libcurl is still around on Enterprise (that means old) linux systems. Sequence Changes Added utility functions to swap elements, reverse the sequence and generate permuations:  ```      int raptor_sequence_swap(raptor_sequence* seq,       int i, int j);      int raptor_sequence_reverse(raptor_sequence* seq,       int start_index, int length);      int raptor_sequence_next_permutation(raptor_sequence *seq,       raptor_data_compare_handler compare);  ``` Raptor2 2.0.5 changes Issues Fixed:   * [0000465](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=465): c99 snprintf usage * [0000476](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=476): Add Format URIs to raptor\_syntax\_descriptions * [0000479](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=479): raptor 2.0.4 : -i nquads fails to treat the context term as optional bugs.librdf.org * [0000481](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=481): Invalid unicode characters cause raptor to emit infinite output while converting n-quads to n-triples  Parser class changes Updated all parser URIs to use the [W3C Format URIs](https://www.w3.org/ns/formats/) as the primary URIs. Existing URIs become aliases. (Nicholas J Humfrey)  GRDDL parser: Correctly set the base\_uri when resolving the sheet URI.  N-Quads parser: Make context optional. (Lauri Aalto) Fixes [Issue #0000479](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=479).  When guessing formats, make N-Quads always beat N-Triples since since now all ntriples parse fine with the nquads parser. (Lauri Aalto)  RDFA parser: fix when building with 64-bit systems to prevent value truncation.  Turtle parser: now uses the official *text/turtle* mime type in the syntax recognizing code. Serializer class changes Updated all serializer URIs to use the [W3C Format URIs](https://www.w3.org/ns/formats/) as the primary URIs. Existing URIs become aliases. (Nicholas J Humfrey)  Turtle serializer now uses the official *text/turtle* mime type in the syntax recognizing code. Do not generate infinite output when the input Unicode UTF-8 encoding is bad. Fixes [Issue #000481](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=481). Unicode class changes Added new utility functions for calculating number of Unicode characters in a UTF-8 string `raptor_unicode_utf8_strlen()` and getting a subset of a UTF-8 string `raptor_unicode_utf8_substr()`:  ```      int raptor_unicode_utf8_strlen(const unsigned char *string,         size_t length);      size_t raptor_unicode_utf8_substr(         unsigned char* dest, size_t* dest_length_p,         const unsigned char* src, size_t src_length,         int startingLoc, int length);  ``` URI class changes `raptor_uri_string_to_relative_uri_string()` now compares URI paths not files. (Joe Presbrey) Fixes [Issue #0000472](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=472) Build changes The library no longer needs `trunc()`, `lround()`, `round()` or anything else from libm. Removed the checks for these functions from `configure`.  `configure` no longer enables debug messages by default for `--enable-maintainer-mode` but now requires the `--enable-debug` option to be given. Other changes Records GIT version in the version string when building from GIT sources with `--enable-maintainer-mode`. This makes it clearer when an non-released version is being used.  Added internal `raptor_format_integer()` which enabled the removal of all internal use of `snprintf()`.  Added `raptor_vsnprintf2()` deprecating `raptor_vsnprintf()` which does not actually have the vsnprintf() calling contention. Added `raptor_snprintf()` with snprintf() calling convention. Added `raptor_vasprintf()` with vasprintf() (GNU) calling convention.  ```      int raptor_vsnprintf2(char *buffer, size_t size,  			  const char *format, va_list arguments);     int raptor_snprintf(char *buffer, size_t size, const char *format, ...);      int raptor_vasprintf(char **ret, const char *format, va_list arguments);  ```  `raptor_locator_format()` now picks a large enough buffer size if `snprintf()` is likely not portable, when HAVE\_C99\_VSNPRINTF is not defined. Fixes [Issue #0000465](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=465)  Internal code style changes for how allocation is done and casting with new macros.  RAPTOR\_GOOD\_CAST: code checks or logic ensures cast will not truncate  RAPTOR\_BAD\_CAST: value may be truncated; may require API change/break. Might be unrealistic e.g. a >4G error message, qname prefix.  Some good uses:   * narrowing a known, checked unicode char to a U16   Some 'bad' uses:   * only handing error messages, literal language, qname prefixes of   a max len constrained by int * passing in data to libxml constrained by int max len * locator column field constrained to int size   Some bad uses:   * iostream read\_bytes and write-bytes methods return int but could   easily return a lot more in the size\_t range (compare to fread).   API change needed. * locator byte field constrained to int size. should be size\_t * raptor\_nfc\_check returns int offset into a buffer that could   be larger * raptor\_ntriples\_parser\_context changed line\_length and offset   to size\_t * raptor\_turtle\_parser changed buffer\_length to size\_t  Updated code to use `size_t` for sizes such as those from `strlen()` and `ptrdiff_t` for pointer differences so that on 64-bit architectures, values are not potentially truncated to size of int. Raptor2 2.0.4 changes Issues Fixed:   * [0000308](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=308): undefined reference to round and trunc while cross compiling for mipsel * [0000449](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=449): ntriples serializer and parser inconsistent w.r.t. \_ in name tokens * [0000451](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=451): Incorrect qname definition in TRiG parser * [0000455](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=455): Incorrect AVL tree operations. [ with fix ] * [0000456](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=456): raptor-2.0.3 fails to build against yajl-2.0.2 API * [0000457](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=457): raptor-2.0.3 fails to build with curl-7.21.7  Parser class changes The `raptor_option` enumeration gains values for setting SSL client side certificates: `RAPTOR_OPTION_WWW_CERT_FILENAME` for the certificate filename, `RAPTOR_OPTION_WWW_CERT_TYPE` for the certificate type and `RAPTOR_OPTION_WWW_CERT_PASSPHRASE` for the certificate passphrase.  `raptor_parser_parse_uri_with_connection()` (which is called by `raptor_parse_uri()`) now uses `raptor_www_set_ssl_cert_options()` to turn the parser options above into settings on the WWW object.  RDF/JSON parser: Gains support for building with [YAJL](http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/) V2. Note that YAJL V1 and V2 both install the same library name 'libyajl' even though they have different ABI and APIs.  TRiG parser: Fixed to support the legal *uri* `: {` ... `}` syntax naming a graph where the '`:`' is optional.  Turtle parser: Modified to not include the internal `input()` function in the lexer which is never needed. Serializer class changes N-Triples and Turtle serializers: Now use `raptor_bnodeid_ntriples_write()` to always write legal blank node IDs. WWW class changes Added support for `raptor_www` to handle setting SSL client certificate options during WWW retrieval.  Added `raptor_www_set_ssl_cert_options()` method to set the SSL client certificates on a WWW object. Other changes Make Raptor build against Curl 7.21.7 which removed a header file that was made an empty file in the libcurl source code on April 26 2004 around version 7.12.0 which is now the minimum version Raptor supports..  Fixed an AVL Tree issue during deletion that messes up some pointers. Patch from 'v-for-vandal'. Thanks.  Added a utility function `raptor_bnodeid_ntriples_write()` to write a N-Triples blank node ID in legal form, replacing any letters not in the allowed set.  Expanded GCC warnings and corrected a few internal uses of `int` when `size_t` was meant. Others remain.  Reduced stack use of `raptor_www_file_handle_fetch()` and `raptor_parser_parse_iostream()` by moving I/O buffer to the www or parser objects respectively. Raptor2 2.0.3 changes The main change is to add the new main header file `raptor2.h`. The new header has been added to allow applications to be sure they have got the raptor V2 header (with `#include <raptor2.h>` and not the raptor V1 header file (`#include <raptor.h>`). The `raptor.h` header will NOT be removed until the next major raptor release (V3). Turtle / TRiG parser changes Alter the parser to not use a large token stack when parsing TRiG graphs, enabling the parser to handle much larger files. The parser still gathers all input into a single memory segment so the maximum amount of input is probably memory size/3.  TRiG parser now allows a QName for the graph name.  Attempted to make the parser handle streaming lexing and parsing but only partially successful; bison could be made to stream parse but flex could not be made to stream lex. This meant it could not be convinced to return a "need more input" response at the end of a chunk of data and continue lexing later.  Fix value ownership fix graph name. Fixes [Issue #0000437](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=437) Other Changes Raptor was ran through the LLVM [clang](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/) static code analyzer and several issues fixed, mostly in unused variables and in unlikely error recovery conditions. Some actual potential crash bugs were found:   1. The workaround for    ancient [libxml2](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/wikis/home) error handling    in `raptor_libxml_xmlStructuredError_handler_parsing()`    was broken for some time, so that probably means nobody uses old    libxml2. 2. [librdfa](https://github.com/msporny/librdfa/) URI    resolving in `rdfa_resolve_uri()` used unallocated    memory in some relative URI cases.   Bison 2.4 is required to build Raptor from GIT source with no pregenerated files. Raptor2 2.0.2 changes Fixed a too strict version checking bug in `raptor_new_world()` Raptor 2.0.1 Changes **DO NOT USE**. Use 2.0.2 which fixes a too strict version checking bug in `raptor_new_world()` Parser class changes The internal librdfa parser that uses Raptor internals now exports symbols prefixed with raptor\_librdfa so that Raptor can be linked with the standard librdfa in applications without symbol clashes. Fixes [Issue #0000416](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=416) Serializer class changes The N-Quads serializer was fixed to output the graph name in the fourth column, instead of repeating the object. Internal changes Replaced all internal fatal errors that went to an `abort()` with regular logged error. Raptor 2.0.0 Changes Raptor V2 final release. See the release notes for 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 for the major changes in Raptor V2. API changes since 1.9.1 beta Added `raptor_syntax_description_validate()` to public API to validate and compute counts for syntax descriptions. Primarily this is for use by Rasqal.  The `raptor_syntax_description` now has an array of URI strings instead of a single one, to allow URI aliasing. This is primarily for use by Rasqal.  Fixed guessing by URI in `raptor_world_guess_parser_name()` which was not working.  Fixed Issues:   * [0000405](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=405): RDFa parser does not handle base href with single quoted value  Raptor 1.9.1 Changes 1.9.1 is the second beta release of Raptor 2 and intended to be the last release before 2.0.0. Raptor V1 to V2 upgrading changes Improved the `upgrade-script.pl` raptor V1 to V2 upgrade script to handle changes to enums and macros as well as handle statement field renaming. Updated the generated documentation to also include enum and macro changes.  Added defensive code in each constructor to check the passed-in raptor world object is a valid Raptor V2 world rather than V1. It generates a warning once per run of the program.  The `raptor_new_world()` function is now a macro that calls an internal function `raptor_check_world_internal()` with a version macro argument to detect when Raptor V2 is invoked with an inconsistent header and library. AVLTree class changes Free the iterator at the end of debug method `raptor_avltree_print()`. I/O Stream class changes Fix major copying too much error in the internal `raptor_read_string_iostream_read_bytes()` memcpy that could cause crashes - the function always copied the maximum amount the user requested in the read method even if the string was smaller. Parser class changes JSON parser: Made relative URIs option work.  N-Quads parser: Added. The serializer already existed.  librdfa parser: Updated to latest librdfa GIT 1a1a08c790b7649a7f6c12fb9e40c0d3dbe70481 Serializer class changes Fix `raptor_serializer_start_to_iostream()` to prevent crash when this method is used more than once on the same serializer.  RSS/Atom serializer: Fix crashes with feeds containing entries with blank node items. Stringbuffer class changes Added utility methods `raptor_stringbuffer_append_uri_escaped_counted_string()` and `raptor_stringbuffer_append_hexadecimal()`. Term class changes Deleted `raptor_term_as_counted_string()` and `raptor_term_as_string()`. Since 1.9.0 was an unstable API, this is allowed.  Added `raptor_term_to_counted_string()` replacing deleted `raptor_term_as_counted_string()`.  Added `raptor_term_to_string()` replacing deleted `raptor_term_as_string()`. URI class changes Added convenience methods for constructing URI terms from strings: `raptor_new_term_from_counted_uri_string()` and `raptor_new_term_from_uri_string()`.  Use string lengths in equals and comparisons for faster checking. Use `memcmp()` instead of `strncmp()` when lengths are known and the same. WWW class changes The CURL WWW module now looks for and uses the HTTP response `Content-Location:` header to get the base URI for content retrievals. This allows these base URIs to be used in parsing content retrived from URIs. Fixes [Issue #0000402](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=402) Raptor 1.9.0 Changes 1.9.0 is the first beta release of Raptor 2. There may be changes and additional releases before version 2.0.0 with the final stable API.  This is a major update and cleanup to the Raptor API and ABI with additions, removals and changes. There are also major restructurings of the internal code and cleanups. There are also some new features in the form of additional APIs, new serializers and parsers.  The details of the additions, removals and changes of functions, structures, typedefs and enums are listed in the [Raptor 2 API reference manual](https://librdf.org/raptor/api/) section on [Changes between raptor 1.4.21 and 1.9.0](https://librdf.org/raptor/api/raptor-changes.html). The [upgrading document](UPGRADING.html) explains how to upgrade existing code that uses the V1 APIs to use the new APIs.  The major changes in this release are:   * Removed all deprecated functions and typedefs. * Renamed all functions to the standard `raptor_`*class*`_`*method* form. * All constructors take a `raptor_world` argument. * URIs are interned and there is no longer a swappable implementation. * Statement is now an array of 3-4 RDF Terms to support triples and quads. * World object owns logging, blank node ID generation and describing syntaxes. * Features are now called options and have typed values. * GRDDL parser now saves and restores shared libxslt state. * Added serializers for HTML 'html' and N-Quads 'nquads'. * Added parser 'json' for JSON-Resource centric and JSON-Triples. * Switched to GIT version control [hosted by GitHub](https://github.com/dajobe/raptor). * Added memory-based AVL-Tree to the public API.   Fixed Issues:   * [0000357](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=357): raptor\_term\_as\_string does not return N-Triples escaped string, although API says so * [0000361](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=361): HTML Table serializer * [0000369](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=369): Unescaped quotes in long literals (Turtle/N3) cause parser failure if at the end of the literal * [0000370](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=370): Odd behaviour regarding the parsing of Trig files * [0000373](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=373): Remove deprecated GTK symbols * [0000379](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=379): raptor libxslt security policy conflicts with apps that also use libxslt and set security policy  General changes Renamed the library name and package tarball name to a new separate names (libraptor2, raptor2-X.tar.gz) so they can be distinguished and installed into the same system as raptor 1 without file clashes. Note: This does not apply to the `rapper(1)` utility and it's manual page which are in both packages. Packagers should stop packaging the `rapper(1)` binary and the rapper manual page from raptor 1, in preference to the raptor 2 version.  Nicholas J Humfrey is a new committer.  A utility script `docs/upgrade-script.pl` is automatically generated from the changes data to aid migrating from Raptor 1 to Raptor 2 APIs. If it is not a simple rename, the script annotates the change as a comment near the code.  Raptor's Statement, Term and URI classes can fully replace librdf's `librdf_statement`, `librdf_node` and `librdf_uri` classes. This has been tested with GIT versions when both Rasqal and librdf are configured with `--with-raptor2`. When raptor 2 is stable, Rasqal and librdf will default to use these.. Documentation changes The API reference manual now includes an automatically generated reference section on the [functions and types that were added, removed and changed between raptor 1 and raptor 2 APIs](https://librdf.org/raptor/api/raptor-formats.html). It also includes an automatically generated section on the [parser and serializers with their names, mime types and Q values.](https://librdf.org/raptor/api/raptor-formats.html)  The tutorial examples were updated to the Raptor 2 APIs.  NOTE: At this time, the descriptive parts of the tutorial have NOT been updated to use the Raptor 2 API. World class changes A log handler function for receiving warnings and errors (fatal or other) are now all sent to a single log handler of type `raptor_log_handler` registered to the world class with `raptor_world_set_log_handler()`, rather than handlers set for each parser, sax2, serializer or www instance. Several constructors lose error handler and error data parameters consequently.  The enumerating approach for listing the known parsers and serializers and writing into variables passed in, was replaced with methods that return pointers to static `raptor_syntax_description` objects to allow more parameters to be returned. This allowed the removal of multiple older calls that kept having to gain new return arguments. The description also returns a list of (mime type, qname) pairs using a new typedef `raptor_type_q`. It includes a set of bitflags for some simple information such as `RAPTOR_SYNTAX_NEED_BASE_URI` to describe when a syntax requires a base URI passed in, otherwise is not needed or optional.  `raptor_world_set_libxml_flags()` is replaced with `raptor_world_set_flag()` which are simple flags that require no initialisation of the world since they are used before it is opened. This means that it cannot use the Options module for world flags. New flag `RAPTOR_WORLD_FLAGS_URI_INTERNING` allows disabling of the URI interning using an AVL-Tree which can use up memory.  `raptor_world_set_libxslt_security_preferences()` and `raptor_world_set_log_handler()` gains an int return value to report failure if world is already opened.  Moved the generation of blank node IDs from the parsers (many objects) to the world class (1 object). Cannot think of good reasons why the blank node ID generation policy needs to be different per-parser. Enumeration `raptor_genid_type` was deleted since only the blank node type was ever used. AVL Tree changes The internal memory-based AVL Tree implementation is exposed as a public API. Features changes Replaced with `raptor_options` Identifier class changes Replaced with Term class.  `raptor_identifier_type` enum was removed and replaced with enum `raptor_term_type` and a smaller set of 3 possible term types. The enum values match the int values used in `librdf_node_type`. I/O Stream class changes Constructors all gain a world argument.  Some methods now return an int error status such as `raptor_iostream_write_end()`  Many classes iostream writing methods and methods of the iostream class itself were changed to follow the standard `raptor_`*CLASS*`_write` naming convention and to put the iostream argument at the end.  Deprecated typedef `raptor_iostream_handler` was removed  Deprecated functions were removed: `raptor_new_iostream_from_handler()`, `raptor_iostream_get_bytes_written_count()` and `raptor_iostream_write_string_turtle()` Locator changes Renamed some methods to follow the `raptor_locator_`*method* standard. Namespaces and namespace stack classes changes Constructors all gain a world argument and lose error handler, error data arguments. Options A new name for what were called features in Raptor 1 and this was expanded to allow use of values types string, integer and boolean. Options can be set on multiple classes such as parser, serializer but are centrally described using the new `raptor_option_description` structure.  The option get / set operations were reduced from multiple methods per class for getting / setting an int, int / string to just one get and one set, with optional parameters. It can also handle adding new types later, which will be passed in as strings and converted internally.  The options code introduces a new enum `raptor_domain` which essentially is for describing a class such as parser. For example options listed for domain `RAPTOR_DOMAIN_PARSER` will be usable with the parser option get and set methods `raptor_parser_get_option(parser, ...)` and `raptor_parser_set_option(parser, ...)`. Parser class changes `raptor_parser_set_strict()` was removed and replaced with a new parser option `RAPTOR_OPTION_STRICT`.  Parser object methods to return information about the parser class were removed since they can be done instead via fields of the static object returned from `raptor_world_get_parser_description()`. Deleted functions include `raptor_parser_get_label()`, `raptor_parser_get_mime_type()`, and `raptor_parser_get_need_base_uri()`.  Parsing may generate start graph and end graph events for syntaxes that return graph names such as TRiG. These are returned by the handler of typedef `raptor_graph_mark_handler` set by new function `raptor_parser_set_graph_mark_handler()` which returns a start or end event of type enum `raptor_graph_mark_flags`.  `raptor_parser_get_accept_header()` fixed length of static string to ensure NUL is copied.  Many functions were renamed to match the `raptor_parser_`*method* naming standard. Some of these get a long longer, but are at least consistent. For example `raptor_parse_uri()` becomes `raptor_parser_parse_uri()`.  Deprecated typedef `raptor_ntriples_parser` was removed.  Deprecated functions were removed: `raptor_ntriples_term_as_string()`, and `raptor_ntriples_string_as_utf8_string()`  The librdfa parser was updated with the latest updates to the RDFa syntax (first, rel/rev, whitespace, xml:lang) and fixes issues with non-terminated strings.  The GRDDL parser now saves and restores the libxslt global state (handlers, security preferences) so that it does not affect other applications in the same memory space. Part of this can be overridden with `raptor_world_set_libxslt_security_preferences()` which allows user code to disable raptor touching the security preferences entirely. Fixes [Issue #0000379](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=379)  The RDF/XML parser never generated special names for bag IDs (bagidNNN), so all support for that has been removed.  The RDF/XML parser uses the new reference-counted URIs and raptor terms to prevent a lot of malloc/free for temporary uses.  Removed RDF/XML parser feature `RAPTOR_FEATURE_ASSUME_IS_RDF` since it did nothing since at least 2003, maybe earlier.  Added a JSON parser (name 'json') that can read both the resource-centric and triples JSON RDF formats. Requires the YAJL JSON parser library. Contributed by Nicholas J Humfrey.  Moved the generation of blank node IDs from the parsers (many objects) to the world class (1 object). Cannot think of good reasons why the blank node ID generation policy needs to be different per-parser. QName class changes Constructors all gain a world argument and lose error handler, error data arguments. Sequence changes Use new generic `raptor_data_free_handler`, `raptor_data_print_handler`, `raptor_data_context_free_handler`, `raptor_data_context_print_handler` data-focused handlers which are shared with the AVL Tree. Serializer class changes Added `raptor_serializer_flush()` for user code to indicate to a serializer to flush state since the application knows a block has been ended, or it needs to save memory. No serializer currently implements this, but it is expected the abbreviated serializers that use a lot of state - Turtle, RDF/XML-Abbrev - would benefit from this.  Added an HTML Table serializer with name 'table' contributed by Nicholas J Humfrey.  Removed the obsolete 'simple' serializer from the source code. N-Triples is an appropriate simple (and well-defined) replacement syntax. Statement class changes This was made a more regular class that can be created, copied and freed using reference counting. The structure changed to be an array of 4 raptor terms rather than a complex union focused on the allowed RDF Statements. This change allows representing non-RDF triples as well as triples with named graphs (also known as quads).  `raptor_statement_part_as_counted_string()` turns into a method of the new Term class, as a "statement part" is now represented as a Term. Term class changes This new class with an open structure replaces `raptor_identifier` and was created to represent an RDF Term: literal, URI or blank node and is reference counted and dynamic. It is a union of fields for three types.  This class can fully replace librdf's librdf\_node when both Rasqal and librdf are built with `--with-raptor2`. The semantics of comparison (ordering) and equality are the same. Unicode changes Several utility functions were renamed to match their functionality more accurately and be associated with the Unicode module set of functions. For example `raptor_utf8_check()` was renamed to `raptor_unicode_check_utf8_string()` URI class changes The whole concept of URI handlers was removed, there is no longer a way to replace the implementation of the URI class. The implementation built in now interns URIs string so that a single URIs for a string is only ever in memory once, but reference counted. This is what Redland librdf has done for many years, and librdf can fully use this.  Deprecated functions were removed: `raptor_uri_is_file_uri()`.  The `raptor_uri_resolve_uri_reference()` now returns the length of the URI written into the buffer. WWW class changes Rename several of the functions to the standard constructor, destructor and method naming format. XML Writer class changes Constructors all gain a world argument and lose error handler, error data arguments. Configuration changes Added configure argument `--with-yajl=DIR` (or 'no') to set the prefix where YAJL libraries and headers are installed.  Raptor headers are now installed in a sub-directory of *PREFIX*`/include`.  `raptor-config` was removed. Building against raptor 2 should be done only using `pkg-config` with either `--cflags` or `--libs` arguments like this:  ```    cc -o prog prog.c `pkg-config raptor2 --cflags`  `pkg-config raptor2 --libs`  ``` Internal changes Code style: lots of changes mostly adding lots more whitespace such as to show control change (if, while) or early function exit (return).  All `strcpy()` with known lengths and `strncpy()` were replaced with `memcpy()` which is quicker and compilers optimize better.  Code style: use `TYPE* var_name = RAPTOR_CALLOC(TYPE, 1, sizeof(*var_name))` rather than repeat the type name which can be error-prone.  Code style: put whitespace round assignment and operators i.e. use `c = a + b` rather than `c=a+b`.  Code style: removed some `strdup()`s.  Code style: try to remove un-necessary `strlen()` by tending to pass around a string with it's length, a counted string. This meant adding a few new constructors such as for the URI and Term classes.  Code style: methods called with a NULL object return failure and destructors called with a NULL object return silently rather than the former mix of crashing or `abort()`ing.  Code style: copy constructor is now called `raptor_`*class*`_copy()` rather than `raptor_new_`*class*`_from_`*class*`()` for brevity.  Code style: print methods return an int return status indicating success. rapper Utility changes Print out the option types next to the description in the `-f help` usage message.  Removed unused `-a` flag from code.  Did NOT rename `-f` option to match the renaming of features to options in the API. Not needed.  Removed long deprecated `-n` flag which was shortcut for selecting the N-Triples parser and can be done with `-i ntriples`  Removed `-s/--scan` flag since it is an option of a single parser (RDF/XML) which can be done with `-f/--feature scanForRDF`. Other changes Removed support for building raptor with dmalloc debugging (removing `--with-dmalloc` configure argument). Valgrind wins.  The example 'grapper' GNOME GUI utility for raptor was updated to the latest GTK APIs (2.5.0+ but still quite old) so that it builds with all the GTK 'disable deprecated' flags set. The UI is not quite correct though - the preferences menu is broken.  Switched to GIT version control, hosted by GitHub. The latest raptor 1 code is available on branch 'raptor1' as well as from the release tags for specific versions. Raptor 1.4.21 Changes This is a bug fix only release with no new features. New development has moved to raptor 2 where a planned ABI and API break is underway.  Fixed Issues:   * [0000318](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=318): Cannot end a Turtle literal with \\ inside triple-quotes * [0000319](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=319): ntriples parser does not register that it accepts ntriples mime type - text/plain * [0000326](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=326): Turtle parser allows '.' in qnames which is not-to-spec * [0000331](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=331): Turtle long literals with raw newlines do not count line numbers correctly * [0000332](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=332): RDFXML parser finds duplicates and misbehaves (when it shouldn't) * [0000337](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=337): raptor/turtle outputs invalid qnames which cause syntax errors on parsing  Parser changes N-Triples parser: Declare acceptance of text/plain mime type with q=0.1  RDFA parser (via librdfa): Updated to fix some buffer management problems when it was passed large blocks (4096 bytes or more), a few memory leaks and some other minor bugs.  RDF/XML parser: Properly reset the ID-checking set at the start of each parse.  Turtle parser: Allow \\ at the end of triple-quoted literals. Forbid '.'s in prefixes and qnames (follow specification). Properly count newlines inside the literals for error reporting. Serializer changes Turtle serializer: Forbid '.'s in prefixes and qnames (follow specification). Other Changes Updated `configure` and the build system to use silent rules for the maintainer (by default), or when `--enable-silent-rules` is passed to `configure`. This feature requires building with automake 1.11 which requires autoconf 2.62 or newer when building from GIT.  `autogen.sh` script was updated to enforce the autotools versions above. Raptor 1.4.20 Changes This is a bug fix only release with no new features. New development has moved to raptor 2 where a planned ABI and API break will happen. There may be preview releases of raptor 2 with 1.9.x numbering.  Fixed Issues:   * [0000306](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=306): rapper doesn't handle datatype=""and xml:lang="" properly with RDFa * [0000307](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=307): configure fails at vnsprintf test when cross compiling * [0000310](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=310): Raptor does not like single character namespaces with RDFa * [0000312](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=312): Ununitialized pointer in example rdfserialize.c causes crash  Parser Changes GRDDL parser: Fix XML parser context resource leak if `raptor_grddl_fetch_uri()` fails. Save and restore error handlers properly to prevent crashes when an error is reported during parsing.  RDFA parser (via librdfa): Update to latest librdfa GIT sources with head a438ce68a40e04b399ec2b2c613d0c867d9315c7  now moved to <https://github.com/msporny/librdfa> to fix handling single character namespaces ([Issue #0000310](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=310)), empty datatype attribute and empty xml:lang attributes ([Issue #0000306](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=306))  Added three unapproved RDFa tests 0172, 0173 and 0174 to cover the fixes above. Serializer Changes Turtle serializer: Applied scalability patch from Chris Cannam. This switches the serializer to use a `raptor_avltree` instead of a `raptor_sequence` for the subject and blanks used with `raptor_abbrev_node_lookup()`. This fixes a performance problem in the serializing and moves lookups from O(N) to O(log N) - from list to balanced tree. Other Changes If cross compiling, check for `vsnprintf()` C99 compatible at runtime by setting define `CHECK_VSNPRINTF_RUNTIME` during configuration. Fixes [Issue #0000307](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=307)  Use `calloc()` for allocating a `raptor_statement` in rdfserializer.c example code to properly initialise state. Fixes [Issue #0000312](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=312)  Use `AC_SYS_LARGEFILE` to get large file IO checks which allows 32-bit systems to read multi-gigabyte files.  `autogen.sh` script fix for if test when uname is not in standard OSX dir. Raptor 1.4.19 Changes **WARNING: FUTURE ABI and API CHANGES.** The next release of raptor 1.4.x will include bug fixes only and no new features. New development will move to raptor 2 where a planned ABI and API break will happen. There may be preview releases of raptor 2 with 1.9.x numbering.

[Issue #0000263](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=263) Fix broken collection abbreviation [Issue #0000277](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=277)  RSS serializer: Fixes for g++  [Issue #0000270](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=270 )  Added a new serializer feature `RAPTOR_FEATURE_PREFIX_ELEMENTS` (short name prefixElements) for atom and rss 1.0 serializers to decide whether core elements in the default namespace are declared with the prefix or without a prefix. Removed generation of deprecated predicate ordinals of type `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_ORDINAL` and replace with resource type URIs XML Support Changes Removed generic calls to `xmlSetStructuredErrorFunc()` and `xmlSetGenericErrorFunc()` which can be a problem when libxml is shared with other code in memory. They may be called optionally but will do a save/restore of the existing functions. This protection is enabled by the new API call `raptor_set_libxml_flags()` to set the flags from values in enum `raptor_libxml_flags`.  [Issue #0000299](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=299)  Use context-specific libslt security configuration to avoid calling generic call `xsltSetDefaultSecurityPrefs()` which can be a problem when libxslt is shared with other code in memory. Allow the user to set the policy for raptor globally with new API function `raptor_set_libxslt_security_preferences()`.  [Issue #0000296](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=296)  Make libxml SAX2 structured errors register parser-specific handler function `raptor_libxml_xmlStructuredErrorFunc()` instead of libxml global structured error handler. The libxml flag method above can still enable registerding the global error handlers.  In `raptor_sax2_parse_chunk()` fixed calls to `raptor_log_error_to_handlers()` when built with expat.  [Issue #0000287](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=287) Other Changes Win32 portability fixes from Lou Sakey:   * Handle absence of `gettimeofday()` * Call `xmlCleanupParser()` libxml call last to avoid an access   violation on windows. * Windows `vsnprintf()` portability patch * `raptor_sequence_set_at()` fixed to maintain the design   contract: provide "size" consecutive items in "sequence" starting from   "start" even when setting items more than +1 offset beyond the end of   sequence.    [Issue #0000276](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=276)   `rapper(1)` utility changes: if counting, do not use a serializer at all. Internal Changes More internal changes to be more resiliant after allocation failure (Lauri Aalto)  Reorganised tests in source tree to pull out specific directories for RDF/XML, Turtle, etc.  Use a DJ Bernstein hash to replace a linked list for storing a stack of namespaces. This makes turtle parsing with lots of namespaces (100s) much faster. Based on the initial patch in the bug.  [Issue #0000290](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=290)  Use new internal `raptor_memstr()` function to compare a string against a buffer that may not be NUL terminated.  [Issue #0000269](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=269)  `raptor_error_handlers`: API structure gains world field. BINARY COMPATIBILITY BREAK: sizeof(raptor\_error\_handlers) changed. Source compatibility not broken.  `raptor_identifier`: API structure gains world field. BINARY COMPATIBILITY BREAK: sizeof(raptor\_identifier) changed. Source compatibility not broken.  More fixes for compiling with C++  Move some more static data as constant to enable more efficient compilation - moves to data segment of object binary.  Use memmove for overlapping copy, not memcpy when doing relative URI resolving. Raptor V2 Preparation Changes Lots of internal changes were made by Lauri Aalto preparing for Raptor V2 to fully attach all static data and config to a new `raptor_world` object. A new static instance of this class is now used internally behind the existing V1 API and will be required to be constructed by the library user for the V2 API with a new constructor/destructor.  **NOTE:** The method names here are illustrative of the final V2 names but are not confirmed - **These functions are not supported in the 1.4.x series**. Some methods will still be altered for fields and (`raptor_world`) parameters. All constructors should have it as a parameter. All methods will not have them (so for example, all the URI methods named \_v2 will lose the world parameter and just have the URI parameter - but that is also because the URI handler/context part will go into raptor\_world in V2)  To use the **unsupported and experimental** V2 functions, define `-DRAPTOR_V2_EXPERIMENTAL=1` when building with raptor.  Added `raptor_world` typedef.  Added raptor world class constructor `raptor_world* raptor_new_world(void)` and initializer: `int raptor_world_open(raptor_world* world)`  Added world class destructor: `void raptor_free_world(raptor_world* world)`  Added new V2 methods:  ```    void raptor_world_set_libxslt_security_preferences(raptor_world *world,     void *security_preferences)    void raptor_world_set_libxml_flags(raptor_world *world,  int flags)    void raptor_error_handlers_init_v2(raptor_world* world,     raptor_error_handlers* error_handlers);

   int raptor_xml_writer_features_enumerate_v2(raptor_world* world,     const raptor_feature feature, const char **name, raptor_uri **uri,     const char **label);  ``` Raptor 1.4.18 Changes Fixed Issues:   * [0000186](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=186): Add RDFa support to Raptor * [0000255](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=255): rss-tag-soup serializer does not generate namespaces so re-serializing in rdf/xml looks wierd for atom  Parser Changes A new [RDFa](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/CR-rdfa-syntax-20080620/) parser was added (name `rdfa`) using [librdfa](http://rdfa.digitalbazaar.com/librdfa/) to implement it. librdfa is linked as part of Raptor and written by Manu Sporny of Digital Bazaar, licensed with the same license as Raptor.  The RDFa [test suite](https://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/RDFa/testsuite/xhtml1-testcases/) was added to the test and (via librdfa) Raptor passes all but 4 tests which fail due to different output xmlns attribute ordering (which does not matter to XML parsers). Serializer Changes Added new function `raptor_serialize_start_to_iostream()` to have the new semantics of not owning and destroying the passed-in iostream. This allows the caller to serialize to an existing iostream and then to continue to write to it. `raptor_serialize_start()` owns and then closes the iostream that is passed in.  A new Atom Syndication Format 1.0 ([RFC 4287](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt)) serializer was added (name `atom`) using the RSS 1.0 RDF triple model with mapping to atom terms and consideration of atom output format conditions.  RSS 1.0 serializer   * Allow setting output namespaces for the serializer * Allow writing extra RDF triples as RDF/XML attached to RSS items. * Recognize predicates with XML Literal and emit as   `parseType="Literal"` or when `content:encoded`,   as a CDATA block, by RSS 1.0 convention. * Removed code assumptions about triples appearing in a certain order. * Free namespaces and stack in correct order   Turtle serializer now respects the `writeBaseURI` feature to control generating the `@base` directive.  Abbreviated serializers (RDF/XML Abbrev and Turtle) now remove duplicate triples.  Added feature `RAPTOR_FEATURE_RSS_TRIPLES` to add RDF triples to RSS 1.0 or Atom serializer output with values 'rdfxml' or 'atom-triples'. Atom triples writes `at:map` sections for the `atom:entry` elements and at:feedmap and `at:entrymap` sections to the `atom:feed` elements. `at:contentType` is used to provide a `type` attribute value for an `atom:content` that has a URI value.  Added `RAPTOR_FEATURE_ATOM_ENTRY_URI` for the Atom serializer to set the URI of an atom entry. If the URI matches the URI of an entry item in the RDF mode of the channel, then an Atom Entry document is generated rather than an Atom Feed document. QName Class Changes Added `raptor_qname_to_counted_name()` to get a formatted qname for a name.  `raptor_new_qname_from_namespace_local_name()` will accept a NULL namespace to construct a namespace-less qname. Sequence Class Changes `raptor_sequence_set_at()` now handles setting an item at an index in the sequence beyond capacity+1 to automatically extend.  Added `raptor_sequence_delete_at()` to delete an item at a position in a sequence and return it. URI Class Changes `raptor_uri_to_relative_counted_uri_string()` now has support for a base URI with scheme and authority but no path, so the result can be a relative URI starting with '/'. XML Writer Class Changes XML Writer allows adding newlines via `raptor_xml_writer_newline()` which requires use of `raptor_xml_writer_flush()` to indicate when XML writer output is finished.  Added `raptor_xml_writer_get_depth()` to get the current XML writer element stack depth. Other Changes Many more resiliance checks were added.  Removed all calls to abort() in code on fatal errors. This requires using setjmp and longjmp inside parsers built with flex and bison.  The Turtle writer may optionally generate @base depending on flags. (This is used by Turtle serializer to handle the writeBaseURI feature)  Tidied error messages for `rapper(1)` when parsing stdin.  raptor\_init() and raptor\_finish() use a reference count to ensure initialising and terminating happen at most once each. Raptor 1.4.17 Changes The main changes to this release are:  Added two new JSON serializers: resource-centric 'json' (Talis [RDF/JSON](http://n2.talis.com/wiki/RDF_JSON_Specification)) and triple-centric 'json-triples'.  Made I/O Stream class `raptor_iostream` support reading as well as writing with new constructors and new methods.  Added a new public SAX2 API class `raptor_sax2` exposing the existing internal API which has been around since the first release of Raptor 8 years ago and runs on top of either expat or libxml2.  Added new public error handlers structure `raptor_error_handlers` containing a set of (function, data pointers) pairs called `raptor_handler_closure` for each error log level. Added `raptor_log_level` enum for the error log level. Added an initialization function for the structure, `raptor_error_handlers_init()`.  Several other API changes, fixes and improvements were made.  Fixed Issues:   * [0000252](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=252): Allow controlling of cache headers in Raptor * [0000245](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=245): Extra classes added to an OWL object  I/O Stream class changes Made I/O Stream class `raptor_iostream` support reading data in addition to writing. (Dave B):   * Deprecated `raptor_iostream_handler` structure for new   `raptor_iostream_handler2` structure which contains the   new factory functions for reading. * Added new read I/O stream factory handler typedefs   `raptor_iostream_read_bytes_func` and   `raptor_iostream_read_eof_func`. * Added new `raptor_new_iostream_from_handler2()` I/O   stream constructor to allow building of read and write iostreams   deprecating `raptor_new_iostream_from_handler()`. * Added new `raptor_iostream_tell()` deprecating   `raptor_iostream_get_bytes_written_count`. * Added new read I/O Stream constructors:   `raptor_new_iostream_from_sink`(),   `raptor_new_iostream_from_filename()`   `raptor_new_iostream_from_file_handle()` and   `raptor_new_iostream_from_string()` * Added new read I/O Stream methods   `raptor_iostream_read_bytes()` and   and `raptor_iostream_read_eof()`.   Added new write I/O Stream method `raptor_iostream_write_string_python()` to write an encoded string to an I/O stream using python / JSON / Turtle / N-Triples / SPARQL escaping rules. (Dave B) Serializer Class Changes Added two new JSON serializers (Dave B):   1. Resource-centric serializer named `json` based on    [Talis RDF/JSON Specification](http://n2.talis.com/wiki/RDF_JSON_Specification) 2. Triple-centric serializer named `json-triples` based on the SPARQL results in JSON format.   Added new serializer features for the JSON serializers (DaveB):   * `RAPTOR_FEATURE_JSON_CALLBACK` (name 'jsonCallback') to   set the top-level callback function name wrapper above the outer object. * `RAPTOR_FEATURE_JSON_EXTRA_DATA` (name 'jsonExtraData') to   add extra top-level JSON object data.   Example of using the resource-centric serializer while defining a callback:  ```  $ rapper -q -o json -f jsonCallback=foo https://librdf.org/raptor/raptor.rdf foo( {   "https://librdf.org/raptor/#raptor" : {     "http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#description" : [ { ...  ``` Statement Class Changes Added `raptor_statement_compare()` to provide an ordering between `raptor_statement` objects. (Dave B) Parser Class Changes Added new parser features to control HTTP headers in web requests (Dave B, based on a patch in the bug): Also never `Pragma:` header with libcurl ever. Fixes [Issue #0000252](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=252)   * `RAPTOR_FEATURE_WWW_HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL` to control   sending `Cache-Control` (default: none) * `RAPTOR_FEATURE_WWW_HTTP_USER_AGENT` to control   sending `User-Agent` (default: none)   Turtle parser:   * Added tests to forbid `'` and   `'''`-quoted strings and to forbid `()` in   triple predicate position following the updated Turtle spec. (Dave B) * Write ';' statement terminators with a leading   space for consistency with '.' terminator. (Dave R) * Remove canonicalisation of integer and double   to match Turtle latest spec. (Dave B)  QName Class Changes Added new methods `raptor_qname_get_local_name()`, `raptor_qname_get_value()` and `raptor_qname_get_counted_value()`. (Dave B) SAX2 Class Changes Added new public SAX2 API class `raptor_sax2` exposind th existing internal one which has been around since the first release of Raptor 8 years ago and runs on top of either expat or libxml2.

(Dave B)  Turtle/N3 parsers and serializers, RDF/XML\_Abbrev serializer: many low memory fixes and better out of memory errors. (Lauri) Other Changes Rewrote internal error log functions to use new error handlers structures and simplify the calls. (Dave B)  Expanded internal `raptor_avltree` datatype support to add a cursor, allowing it to be used for creating large ordered sequences that need to be walked. (Dave B)  Updated `rdfdiff` utility to handle duplicate triples in inputs. (Dave B)  `raptor_sequence_shift()` and `raptor_sequence_unshift()` are now as efficient as the sequence push and pop operations: O(1). (Lauri)  `autogen.sh` was updated.  `rapper` utility can now accept multiple `-f` / `--feature` options; previously only one parser and one serializer feature was possible. Raptor 1.4.16 Changes The main changes to this release are:  Provide 100% support for the [GRDDL W3C Recommendation of 2007-09-11](https://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-grddl-20070911/).  The [Turtle](https://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/) parser and serializer were updated to support `@base` for specifying a base URI, following Turtle of 2007-09-11.  The Turtle and RDF/XML serializers had performance improvements for large graphs.  Added a TRiG Parser based on Turtle with named graph support.  Several other API changes, fixes and improvements were made.  Fixed Issues:   * [0000188](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000188): Wrong RAPTOR\_API definition for mingw * [0000192](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000192): raptor\_uri\_filename\_to\_uri\_string() - getcwd() loop error * [0000194](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000194): parser and serializer don't recognize the same mime types * [0000195](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000195): Compile error in raptor\_serialize.c debug code * [0000207](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000207): RDF file can be parsed, but not then serialised. * [0000210](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000210): RAPTOR\_FEATURE\_WRITER\_XML\_DECLARATION broken in Ruby * [0000214](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000214): Empty rdf:about, plus base-uri, produces incorrect turtle output * [0000216](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000216): flickrdf segfaults at raptor\_serialize\_end! * [0000217](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000217): flickrdf segfaults at raptor\_serialize\_end! * [0000232](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000232): libraptor does not correctly free up libxml error handler, causing crashes in subsequent calls to libxml error handlers * [0000237](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000237): raptor\_sequence robustness: item ownership on insert error * [0000238](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000238): GRDDL parser in SVN overwrites blank nodes when merging graphs * [0000239](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000239): GRDDL parser in SVN returns 60 less triples with https://www.w3.org/  Namespaces Class Changes `raptor_namespaces_init()` now returns an integer status. Parser Class Changes Added `raptor_graph_handler` typedef and `raptor_set_graph_handler()` to return named graph identifiers during parsing, initially for the TRiG parser.  These were added the GRDDL parser:   * `RAPTOR_FEATURE_MICROFORMATS` (microformats) to enable   hCard and hCal microformats * `RAPTOR_FEATURE_HTML_TAG_SOUP` (htmlTagSoup) to use   the HTML tag soup parser if the XML parsing fails * `RAPTOR_FEATURE_HTML_LINK` (htmlLink) to enable html   <link> * `RAPTOR_FEATURE_WWW_TIMEOUT` (wwwTimeout) for setting   URI retrieval timeouts during processing  XML Element Class Changes Added `raptor_new_xml_element_from_namespace_local_name()` constructor to make an XML element from a local name relative to a `raptor_namespace`. Unicode Class Changes Defined a new `raptor_unichar` typedef for a Unicode codepoint defined as `unsigned long` which was the previous type used. Altered the Unicode function to take it as a parameter. `raptor_unicode_char_to_utf8()`, `raptor_utf8_to_unicode_char()`, `raptor_unicode_is_xml11_namestartchar()`, `raptor_unicode_is_xml10_namestartchar()`, `raptor_unicode_is_xml11_namechar()` and `raptor_unicode_is_xml10_namechar()`. URI Class Changes Added `raptor_uri_compare()` and `raptor_uri_compare_func` function pointer for implementing it in the `raptor_uri_handler`. The handler now has a version field `initialised` to trigger the new factory method for uri compare when the version is 2 or more. WWW Class Changes Added `raptor_www_set_connection_timeout()` to set the WWW retrieval connection timeout in seconds.  Added `raptor_www_final_uri_handler` typedef and `raptor_www_set_final_uri_handler()` to return the final URI seen *during* WWW retrieval such as after redirects.  Added `raptor_www_get_final_uri()` to return the final URI *after* a WWW retrieval which might include redirects. Parser Changes The GRDDL parser/processor was substantially updated and now supports 100% of the [Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages (GRDDL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-grddl-20070911/) syntax, W3C Recommendation of 2007-09-11:   * Transforming XML with XSLT 1.0 * Processing XML namespaces. * Transforming XHTML with XSLT 1.0 * Processing HTML profiles. * Handling of base URIs and URI redirects. * XInclude processing. * Parsing as RDF/XML when it is recognised after a transform.   it also:   * Handles hCard and hCal microformats when feature   `RAPTOR_FEATURE_MICROFORMATS` is enabled (default   enabled). * Handles <link type="application/rdf+xml" href="URI" /> to   RDF/XML content when feature `RAPTOR_FEATURE_HTML_LINK` is   enabled (default enabled). * Attempts parsing with libxml's HTML parser if XML parsing fails,   when feature `RAPTOR_FEATURE_HTML_TAG_SOUP` is enabled   (default enabled). * Discards errors during recursive processing such as 404s,   failure to parse, failure of XSLT processing. * Uses XSLT security - denies reading, writing to files,   directories or writing to network. * Accepts the `RAPTOR_FEATURE_NO_NET` feature to prevent   all networking. * Allows fine-grained URI filtering with   `raptor_parser_set_uri_filter()`.   RDF/XML parser recognising was updated to just the start of the document for guessing if it should handle content and to try to avoid html URLs.  RSS Tag soup parser recognising was updated to accept with the string 'feed' in the identifier.  TRiG Parser was added based on the Turtle parser, adding named graphs. It returns name graph URis via a callback set with new API call `raptor_set_graph_handler()`  Turtle parser added `@base` support, fixed turtle escapes to URIs. Recognising was updated to look for `@prefix` early in the document. Serializer Changes Turtle serialiser changes:   * Generate `@base` when an output base URI is given. * Properly format Turtle XSD doubles using new snprintf code. * Fix unwanted blank line at end of Turtle list abbreviation. * Use AVL Tree rather than sequence for significant performance   improvement for large serialisations.   RDF/XML serialiser was changed to emit a legal empty RDF/XML document when no triples are serialised and to skip emitting statements with bad predicate uris rather than returning an error.  RDF/XML Abbrev serialiser was changed to use an AVL tree rather than sequence for significant performance improvement for large serialisations. `rapper` Utility Changes Added an `--show-graphs` option to print named graph URIs as seen (such as with TRiG).  Added `-I` / `--input-uri` and `-O` / `--output-uri` options to set the input / parsing and output / serializing base URIs separately. Defaults remain the same - the serializer base URI defaults to the input base URI, however it was set. Portability Changes Fixes for when building from Subversion on cygwin (EOL issues, Makefiles).  Remove unused semicolons for prevention of compiler warnings.  Fix some uninitialized variables that some compilers complain about.  Allow `RAPTOR_ASSERT_DIE` to be externally defined.  Allow `RAPTOR_WWW_BUFFER_SIZE` to be externally defined. Other Changes `autogen.sh` was updated to handle program versions better using an inline perl helper.  Start to add resiliance to memory allocation failures and errors inside the library.  Added AVL Tree code to make much faster key:value lookups. This is used for RDF/XML parser XML ID checks and in the 'abbrev' serializers - Turtle and RDF/XML-Abbrev for looking up nodes.  Better libxml error messages are now returned, mentioning some of the names and values that caused the error. Raptor 1.4.15 ChangesGeneral Changes GRDDL parser now passes the (unapproved) test suite for the [GRDDL W3C Working Draft 2 March 2007](https://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-grddl-20070302/) except for two tests that have been reported as having errors.  When using libcurl as the WWW retrieval library, errors in resolving a URI such as not found (404) are now reported as proper errors and cause parsing to fail rather than just return no triples.  Some improvments where made to guessing for a parser to match some content. Firstly, any mime type with Q <10 is added to the score, don't lose the influence of the mime type entirely. The consequence of this is that Turtle can pretend to be a partial N3 parser. Secondly, the XHTML mime type is now correctly recognised by the GRDDL parser rather than the RSS Tag Soup parser.  Fixed Issues:   * [#0000174](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000174): Serializing to rdfxml\* with a base\_uri doesn't set the `xml:base` attribute, but does truncate `rdf:about` and `rdf:resource` values * [#0000177](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000177): Some URI references mis-resolved * [#0000178](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000178): No errors from accessing 404 URIs * [#0000180](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000180): messages garble output to stdout  Parser and Serializer Changes Added better error reporting for XML errors using the libxml structured error reporing api.

Changed the RSS Tag Soup parser and RSS 1.0 serializer to stop sharing use of the declared namespaces so that when using both at the same time, there is no double-free of the same objects.  Correct the content: namespace URI in the RSS parser and serializers. Other Changes `rapper` gains a `-t/--trace` option to show URIs traversed. Handy for GRDDL.  `raptor_uri_resolve_uri_reference()` no longer goes past the end of buffer when the relative URI is `,/`  Added an internal API for capturing parsed data as it is seen. Use by GRDDL parser but with no public API.  Added an internal API for structured error reporting. Updates made throughout the library but with no public API.  Internal API `raptor_new_sax2()` signature changed to just have an `error_handlers` pointer argument rather than multiple function / user\_data pairs. Raptor 1.4.14 ChangesGeneral Changes Added a [Turtle Terse RDF Triple Language](https://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/) serialiser by [Dave Robillard](http://codeson.net/) based on the existing RDF/XML-Abbrev serialiser.  Added a GraphViz [DOT format](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) serialiser by Evan Nemerson.  The GRDDL parser now does namespace and profile URI recursion and has other improvements and fixes.  Fixed Issues:   * [#0000032](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=32): GRDDL indirection feature request * [#0000141](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=141): Crash when GRDDL parser is used with a used-generated blank node ID prefix. * [#0000143](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=143): Crash when GRDDL parser fails to retrieve URI. * [#0000148](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=148): A public function to generate a blank ID would be nice though. * [#0000155](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=155): entity processing in literal property elements (with libxml) * [#0000157](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=157): Crash when RDF/XML Abbrev serializer sees a `rdf:type` predicate with a literal object.  Configuration Changes `raptor-config` gains a `--private-libs` for the internal libraries used in building raptor, with the public ones only emitted with `--libs`.  `raptor.pc` now uses `Libs.private` for internal dynamically linked libraries.  The libxml minimum version is now 2.6.8 since 2.6.7 crashes on PPC64 Linux. 2.6.8 was released March 2004 so this should be no burden.  Do not use `PATH_MAX` so raptor can build on Hurd. Parser Changes RDF/XML parser now looks for the RDF/XML root element and namespace declaration in the initial bytes of content when guessing. This allows content that is in other mime types such as `application/xml` to be more likely guessed as RDF/XML.  When guessing a parser to use, if an an exact match is found for the mime type (q=10), then that parser is used.  The GRDDL parser has several changes:   * Recurses through the root element's namespace URI and the profile   URIs. It excludes several common namespace URIs from processing   (XHTML, RDF/XML, XML Schema) and does not traverse the GRDDL profile   URI itself. * Tries to guess which of the RDF/XML or Turtle parser is wanted   from an XSLT result. Guessing is performed because not all the XSLT   sheets used in the demonstrations set the mime type to match Turtle's   unregistered type, or because the return no mime type, or return an   XML one, when it was expected RDF/XML would be received. * Watches the processed URIs and never visits the same URI more   than once in a session. * Passes on general XSLT errors to raptor rather than letting the   default (printing to stderr) work. * Declares XSLT 'base' and 'Base' parameters to allow some XSLT   sheets to work - pragmatism.  Serializer Changes Added a new [Turtle Terse RDF Triple Language](https://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/) serializer and two new internal APIs based on the existing RDF/XML-Abbrev serialiser, written by [Dave Robillard](http://codeson.net/):   * `turtle_writer` for serializing triples to Turtle This   may be moved to the public API in a future release. * `raptor_abbrev` for the common 'abbreviated   serializer' core that is shared between the RDF/XML-Abbrev and Turtle   serializer.   Added a new GraphViz [DOT format](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) serialiser writen by Evan Nemerson.  Note that testing the turtle serializing (`make test`) requires the `rdfdiff -u` and a few of the tests take some time to run. Other Changes Added `raptor_home_url_string` and `raptor_license_string` exported strings.  Added `raptor_parser_generate_id()` as a public function to generate an identifier for a parser.  `rdfdiff` gains the -u/--base-uri option to specify the from file base URI so that if the from file is a local file or relative URI, it can be given an absolute base.  Failures to retrieve content from a URI using the `raptor_www` class implementations now return a failure as well as setting the HTTP status code to 403 or 404 as appropriate. Previously success may have been returned with no bytes. Raptor 1.4.13 ChangesGeneral Changes Prevent losing memory for a `raptor_xml_writer` when a serializer is reused several times.  Fixed issues reported on the [Redland Issue Tracker](https://bugs.librdf.org/):   * [Issue #0000134](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=134): Check for equal scheme and authority during construction of relative URIs from two absolute URIs.  Configuration Changes In maintainer mode, add all the supported compiler `-W` warning flags to the CFLAGS.  Allow `LEX` to be set to things that aren't exactly 'flex'. Documentation Changes Added single triple serializing example to the tutorial to demonstrate serializing without parsing and building a `raptor_statement`. Other Changes Declare several raptor functions with GCC printf-formatting attributes when using a new enough GCC.  RDF/XML parser now creates literals with `raptor_stringbuffer` so that it does a lot less copying when constructing longer literals.  Added single `raptor_statement` serializing example to demonstrate serializing alone without parsing. Raptor 1.4.12 Changes Restored the order of serialized syntaxes back to the same as in Raptor 1.4.10 which Redland was relying on - asking to serialize to mime type 'application/rdf+xml' without specifying a parser name in Redland with Raptor 1.4.11 wrote it in XMP instead of RDF/XML as it used to. This happened more often with language bindings. That problem will be fixed in a future release of Redland but for now, this stops wierd things like that happening. Raptor 1.4.11 ChangesGeneral Changes Added `raptor_get_feature_count()` to return the count of features, in preference to using the macro value `RAPTOR_FEATURE_LAST`.  Added `raptor_www_set_uri_filter()` method of the WWW class (`raptor_www`) objects to have an optional URI filter function that checks if the URL given is allowed to be retrieved, or denied entirely.  Fixed issues reported on the [Redland Issue Tracker](https://bugs.librdf.org/):   * [#0000112](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000112): raptor\_namespaces\_qname\_from\_uri not public API? * [#0000110](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000110): strcasecmp problem under windows (raptor\_rss.c does not compile) * [#0000091](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000091): guess parser should guess the syntax each time it is run, not be fixed * [#0000089](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000089): Add a NONET feature to prevent network fetches * [#0000041](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000041): Allow multiple transformation URLs in data-view:transformation property * [#0000014](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=0000014): bNode content written twice in rdfxml-abbrev output mode  Documentation Changes The [Raptor Reference Manual](https://librdf.org/raptor/api/) now includes descriptions of all the parsers and serializers and the tutorial has a new section describing how to filter URIs and deny network requests. Parser Changes Added functionality to prevent network requests either via setting a new feature `RAPTOR_FEATURE_NO_NET` that denies network requests during a parser operation or with a URI filter function `raptor_parser_set_uri_filter()`. This function uses `raptor_www_set_uri_filter()` internally.  Added `raptor_get_need_base_uri()` to tell if a parser requires a base URI argument. Presently the *N-Triples* parser is the only parser that does not require a base URI. `raptor_start_parse()` will now throw an error if no base URI is given and it is needed.  The *GRDDL parser* was changed to handle a list of URIs in the profile so it now can support `dataview:transformation` in XML taking a list of transformations as defined in [The GRDDL profile for XHTML](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec#grddl-xhtml) part of the GRDDL specification. It now also recognises [Embedded RDF](http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki/Main/RdfInHtml) and [HCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) using well known XPaths and transforms them to RDF triples using well known XSLT sheet URIs.  The *Guess parser* now resets after each parse and does a fresh guess on the syntax based on the incoming information. Fixes [Issue #0000091](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=91)  The *Turtle parser*  (and experimental N3 parser) were changed to now require base URIs as they always should have. The error messages when reporting problems with grammar tokens now return better responses. Added better memory cleanup during parser error recovery. Serializer Changes The *RSS 1.0 Serializer* now works again.  Updated the *RDF/XML Abbreviated* serializer to do proper reference counting on the blank/resource nodes used as subjects and objects to prevent dual-triple generation. Fixes the reported [Issue #0000014](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=14) Other Changes The internal SAX2 API can also prevent network fetches with the feature `RAPTOR_FEATURE_NO_NET`.  Fixed a SAX2 problem that caused parsers that use it to leak memory for 1 URI, affected RDF/XML and RSS Tag Soup.  `rapper` help and verbose message formats were tidied. Raptor 1.4.10 ChangesGeneral Changes No parser will now generate a triple with an identifier type `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_ORDINAL`. Only identifier type resource, anonymous (blank node) and literal will be generated. All serializers will convert any `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_ORDINAL` type on input to type resource. Configuration Changes No longer adds LDFLAGS to pkgconfig file `raptor.pc` and `raptor-config` fixing [Issue #0000097](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=97). Parser Changes All parsers no longer generate a triple with an identifier type `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_ORDINAL`, as deprecated in 1.4.8. The replacement type generated is `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_RESOURCE`.  The RSS Tag Soup (`rss-tag-soup`) parser now makes the triples appear before parser destruction. This caused odd symptoms like parsing in python returning no triples and the parser then crashing during object destruction.  The RDF/XML (`rdfxml`) parser no longer crashes if a comment is seen outside an element, such as before or after the root element. Serializer Changes The RDF/XML (`rdfxml`) serializer no longer crashes if the serializer is used more than once. Raptor 1.4.9 ChangesConfiguration and Build Changes Now using [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) for version control and the [Raptor installation instructions](INSTALL.html) explain how to get Raptor from Subversion.  configure now allows `--enable-parsers=node` and `--enable-serializers=none`. Using both is possible!  No longer require libxml2 for the RSS Tag Soup parser  Various Win32 fixes and VC build files updates from John Barstow. Documentation Changes A new [Raptor Tutorial](https://librdf.org/raptor/api/tutorial.html) was written covering using all parsing and serializing functions along with example code.  The [Raptor Reference Manual](https://librdf.org/raptor/api/reference-manual.html) now covers 100% of all functions, structs and defines with gtkdoc generated documentation. `rapper` utility Changes `rapper` now uses namespaces found in parsing to give hints to the serializer as to how to format the output. The result of this is that `rapper` can be used as an RDF pretty-printer and is especially good at such things as turning flat N-Triples to RDF/XML or RDF/XML-Abbrev. such as:  ```  rapper -q -i ntriples -o rdfxml-abbrev example.nt  ``` Parser Changes All parsers no longer generate `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_PREDICATE` as the statement predicate type, as deprecated in 1.4.8. The replacement type generated is `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_RESOURCE`.  The Turtle parser now has `true` and `false` boolean literals, which were accidently omiited from the parser in the 1.4.8 update.  Parsers can register capabilities for handling multiple mime types with Q values. These are then used in WWW requests for content in the `Accept:` header for HTTP. Added `raptor_parser_factory_add_mime_type` for registering, `raptor_parser_get_accept_header` to get the accept header values for the types supported by one parser.  From the previous change, the RSS parser now accepts several unregistered RSS mime types as well as the registered Atom one; the RDF/XML parser accepts unregistered mime type `text/rdf` seen occasionally; the Turtle parser accepts several experimental mime types. All unregistered or experimental types are accepted with lower Q than any registered type.  The RSS Tag Soup parser for RSS\* and Atom no longer requires libxml2 (for it's XML Reader API). Internal changes mean that it will fully work on top of expat. Serializer Changes The RSS/Atom serializer now uses input namespace declarations to choose namespaces on output.  Added `raptor_serialize_set_namespace_from_namespace` to set a namespace for serializing from an existing `raptor_namespace`.  Serializing to RDF/XML (or RDF/XML Abbrev) now does not double-free URI strings. Fixes [Issue #0000065](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=65)  RSS serializer no longer writes the XML header twice. IOStream Class Changes Added `raptor_iostream_write_uri` to directly write a URI to an iostream without the need to go via a string.  Fixed bug in `raptor_iostream_write_xml_any_escaped_string` failing to write ';' after escaping U+0009 and U+000A Namespaces Class Changes Added `raptor_namespaces_qname_from_uri` to do URI splitting into qname prefering to use the current in-scope namespaces before having to search.  `raptor_namespaces_format` now NULL-terminates the namespace string. Fixes [Issue #0000062](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=62)  Added `raptor_namespace_get_counted_prefix` to return a namespace prefix and it's length. QName Class Changes Added `raptor_qname_get_namespace` to get the namespace associated with a QName. StringBuffer Class Changes `raptor_stringbuffer_append_counted_string` and `raptor_stringbuffer_append_string` now Do nothing on appending a NULL string or a string of length 0. Fixes [Issue #0000073](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=73) Unicode Class Changes `raptor_utf8_to_unicode_char` now also checks for overlong UTF-8 sequences, illegal code positions or out of range codes. URI Class Changes Deprecated `raptor_uri_is_file_uri` which takes a URI string argument for new function `raptor_uri_string_is_file_uri` which more clearly says that.  Changed all URI string calloc/mallocs to add enough room for a full pointer at the string end to stop valgrind moaning on 64bit systems when looking for the end of string NUL.  `raptor_uri_set_handler` and `raptor_new_iostream_from_handler` now take const *handler* arguments. WWW Class Changes Get the curl success status into a long, not an int which causes failure on 64 bit. Fixes [Issue #0000075](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=75)  WWW requests for content to parse now always send an appropriate `Accept:` header with Q values for the parser, or for the `guess` parser, all supported mime types. Internal Changes Added XML element methods `raptor_xml_element_get_attributes` and `raptor_xml_element_get_attributes_count`, `raptor_xml_element_is_empty` to the SAX2 API.  Many internal changes were made to the SAX2 API to finally separate XML and RDF/XML parts. The SAX2 API is now fully usable on either libxml2 or expat. That last sentence implies a lot of work, by the way. Raptor 1.4.8 ChangesGeneral Changes A large source re-arrangement was performed. All C sources and headers that build the library are now in the src dir, general documentation in the doc dir and utilities in the utils dir. This both tidied up the mixture of files at the top level and also enabled better use with gtk-doc.  Future API change: From the next release of Raptor, `raptor_statement` predicates will return identifiers of type `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_RESOURCE` instead of `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_PREDICATE`. Identifiers of type `RAPTOR_IDENTIFIER_TYPE_ORDINAL` may no longer be returned in any statement position (to be confirmed).  Version Control change: Raptor will be switching to use [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) for version control after the 1.4.8 release. Please check the [Redland Subversion site](http://svn.librdf.org/) for the latest status or the online [Raptor installation notes](https://librdf.org/raptor/INSTALL.html) for the raptor specific subversion installation information. Configuration Changes The autogen.sh script for building from CVS was revamped to be more modular.  `configure` now takes an `--enable-gtk-doc` option to enable building of the documentation using the `gtk-doc` utility. It is by default enabled only if the utility is available.  Added a new configure option `--enable-serializers` (in 1.4.7) to allow the selection of the required RDF serializers from any of those supported.  `raptor-config` now has a `--options` argument to list the configured or discovered options of the library such as parsers, serializers and other choices. Documentation Changes The GNOME `gtk-doc` program is now used to automatically extract documentation from source comments into reference documentation. This is then merged with templates and additional documentation to provide a reference manual for raptor as XML document which is turned into HTML along with GNOME devhelp support.  This new documentation intended to replace the libraptor manual page/web page as easier to read document with scope for better expanding with more detail of raptor including examples and tutorial information. The manual page will continue to contain the summary information for the present. Portability Changes Fixed a long-standing URI resolution bug on win32 - only remove leading / if there is one present (patch from John C. Barstow) `rapper` utility Changes Altered the `-g` argument to invoke the guessing parser rather than guess on file/URI name alone. This is now equivalent to choosing an input syntax of *guess* with `-i guess`.  Added a `--show-namespaces` long option (no short version) to show namespaces that are declared in the parsed content. Parser Changes A new guessing parser was added, picking the actual parser to use at run-time based on protocol or other information.  Allow a content type returned by a protocol (such as HTTP) to enable choosing of parser at run-time. Added a new optional parser factory method `content_type_handler` to return this.  Allow parsers to handle several syntaxes rather than only 1 or 2.  Parsers can now return namespace prefix/URI declarations as they are given in the content by the means of a new handler type `raptor_namespace_handler` and parser method `raptor_set_namespace_handler`. Duplicate namespace prefix/URIs can be returned. GRDDL Parser Changes Bug fix when the entire content is in one chunk (RenÃ© Puls). Guessing Parser Changes A new parser that guesses the actual parser to use at run-time based on a combination of MIME Content-Type, file or URI name and in future, iniital bytes of the content. If the Content-Type is an exact match to a known parser, it is always chosen before trying heuristics. RDF/XML Parser Changes When emitting literals, handle a datatyped empty literal. This is a post-REC errata for the revised RDF/XML recommendation. See [archived example](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2005Jul/0017.html) for further information. RSS Tag Soup Parser Changes Added atom 1.0 support including use of the new namespace. Atom 0.3 namespace terms are turned into new properties. Replace atom copies of Dublin Core or RSS properties with the original terms:   | Atom 1.0 term | Original term | | --- | --- | | `atom:content` | `rss:description` | | `atom:id` | `rss:link` | | `atom:published` | `dc:date` | | `atom:rights` | `dc:rights` | | `atom:title` | `rss:title` |   Apply the in-scope base URI (such as from `xml:base`) to atom 1.0 fields that take URI values: `atom:id`, `atom:icon` and `atom:logo`.  Added optional date parsing code to turn XML RSS date fields into ISO format ones, suitable for Atom and XML schema datatypes format. Will use library parsedate code from curl or INN if available.  XML RSS field `pubDate` is now turned into Dublin Core `dc:date` field in the ISO format.  XML RSS field `content` is turned into `content:encoded` in RDF triples on output with escaping. Turtle Parser Changes Updated to support Turtle version 2006-01-02 ([announcement](https://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/)).  Switch qname, blank node and prefix definitions to SPARQL ones.  Check for illegal not-hexadecimal \u and \U escape values.  Fix greedy matching of long literals ("""....""") that ended on the last """ found rather than the first.  Added double and decimal constants.  Added optional +- sign to all numeric constants.  Allow \" escape inside long strings.  Take care to reset the generated `raptor_statement` language and datatype fields when not used. Serializer Changes Added a new Atom 1.0 serializer (name *atom*) by parameterising the RSS 1.0 serializer.  Added a new Adobe XMP compatible serializer (name *rdfxml-xmp*) by parameterising the RDF/XML Abbreviated serializer. Patch provided by Sid Steward.  All serializers can be chosen at `configure` time from those available using configure option `--enable-serializers`.  The RSS parser and serializer can now be independently enabled or disabled. The RSS serializer no longer requires an XML parser. RDF/XML Serializer / XML Writer Changes A new XML Writer feature `RAPTOR_FEATURE_WRITER_XML_VERSION` was added to allow chosing XML 1.0 (value 10) or XML 1.1 output (value 11). This feature is also accepted by serializers as an option and used by the RDF/XML and RDF/XML-Abbrev serializers.  A new XML Writer feature `RAPTOR_FEATURE_WRITER_XML_DECLARATION` was added to allow omitting the XML declaration (default true).  Added functions `raptor_xml_any_escape_string()` and `raptor_iostream_write_xml_any_escaped_string()` which take an XML version. The XML 1.0 functions give errors when attempting to write #x1-#x1f (excluding #x9, #xA, #xD) or #x7F. Atom 1.0 Serializer Changes Added a new serializer using the Atom 1.0 format and namespace. This reads RDF triples in the RSS 1.0 model, along with any additional atom 1.0 properties and serializes an Atom 1.0 feed file. Adobe XMP Serializer Changes Added a new serializer writing RDF/XML in the profile used by Adobe XMP. Note that this does require RDF triples to be used in a certain style; for example all triple subjects are the "current documment" giving `rdf:about=""`. URI Class Changes Fix a bug when adding a default path of / to a URI in functions `raptor_new_uri_for_xmlbase()` and `raptor_new_uri_for_retrieval()`. (Bug #[0000045](https://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=45))  *raptor\_uri\_equals* was altered to accept NULL pointers, which do not compare equal to a non-NULL URI. NULL does equal NULL. Internal Changes The internal SAX2 class was extensively changed so that remaining interdependencies with the RDF/XML parser were removed and it can now be re-used for other syntaxes cleanly. Several functions were modified or added.  Removed old and hardly-tested internal support for XML entity resolution (libxml only).  Various fixes for GCC 4 warnings. Raptor 1.4.7 Changes Fix a couple of crashes in the RSS tag soup parser / serializer (Dave Beckett, Suzan Foster).  `configure` now looks for the `libxslt/xslt.h` header as well as the `libxslt` library and disables XSLT and GRDDL support it if is missing. This catches systems with the libraries without headers as has happened on some OSX versions.  In serializers rdfxml and rdfxml-abbrev, report failure to serialize to RDF/XML if the predicate URI is not absolute. Raptor 1.4.6 Changes Added `--with-xslt-config` configure option  Added a new parser for [Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages (GRDDL)](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec) which allows reading XHTML and XML as RDF triples by using profiles in the document that declare XSLT transforms from the XHTML/XML content into RDF/XML which is the RDF content. It does not support all the GRDDL styles, for example `dataview:namespaceTransformation`, or perform recursive transformations.  The turtle parser now accepts """long literals"""  XML writer feature support were added in 1.4.5 and not documented. The new functions are: `raptor_xml_writer_features_enumerate`, `raptor_xml_writer_set_feature`, `raptor_xml_writer_set_feature_string`, `raptor_xml_writer_get_feature` and `raptor_xml_writer_get_feature_string`. The three XML writer features added are \fBRAPTOR\_FEATURE\_WRITER\_AUTO\_INDENT\fR with boolean value (default true) to auto-indent the XML, \fBRAPTOR\_FEATURE\_WRITER\_AUTO\_EMPTY\fR with boolean value (default true) to automatically generate empty elements if a start/end element sequence has no content and \fBRAPTOR\_FEATURE\_WRITER\_INDENT\_WIDTH\fR with an integer value (default 2) to set the indenting level for the XML.  New build configuration and portability fixes for win32 (John Barstow)  Portability fixes for win32 - added `SIZEOF_UNSIGNED_SHORT` (Dave Viner, others)  Added a signing memory debugging system to aid checking when raptor-allocated memory is freed in another library or vice-versa enabled by `--with-memory-signing` configure option (defaults to on in maintainer mode).  Fixed a few internal malloc/frees to use RAPTOR\_MALLOC / RAPTOR\_FREE so that the above signed memory system worked.  RDF/XML serializer: Use the maximal name when splitting a predicate. Turn datatyped literals that are rdf:XMLLiteral into inline XML with `rdf:parseType="Literal"` rather than XML-escaped.  RDF/XML abbreviated serializer: Fix a crash when there is a NULL base URI. Use the maximal name when splitting a predicate. Turn datatyped literals that are rdf:XMLLiteral into inline XML with `rdf:parseType="Literal"` rather than XML-escaped.  RSS tag soup parser: Fix crash with unexpected use of `alternate` attribute. Update from Suzan Foster to reflect the latest status of the enclosure vocabulary and allow multiple common items and fields.  RSS 1.0 serializer: Added RSS enclosures serializing.  `grapper` example GTK program now stores the window width and height using gconf2. Raptor 1.4.5 Changes Added a new *RDF/XML with abbreviations* serializer `rdfxml-abbrev` written by Steve Shepard which handles several of the abbreviations specified by the [RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised)](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/) W3C Recommendation. It is suitable for writing small documents as there are known scaling issues.  The RSS tag soup parser was updated to work better when there is no base URI given. It also now supports reading the [RSS 1.1](http://inamidst.com/rss1.1/) format and turning it into RSS 1.0 model triples.  Deprecated `raptor_ntriples_string_as_utf8_string` as rather too internal to be useful, since it only works with a parser.  More fixes to work around the broken libxml2 on Apple OSX 10.3.x with inconsistent shared libraries / headers.  Experimental and incomplete Notation 3 parser - updated to match changes to Turtle. CVS changes only, not enabled in standard builds. Raptor 1.4.4 Changes Make the RSS tag soup parser handle RSS 0.9 namespace elements by turning them into RSS 1.0.  Fix a couple of crashes in the RSS 1.0 serialiser when no base URI is used.  Make `raptor_uri_to_relative_counted_uri_string` work when the base or reference URI have no paths such as like *http://example.org*  Added portability fixes for Win32 to get Raptor 1.4.3 building with MS Visual Studio using expat and libcurl. The RAPTOR\_INTERNAL define was moved to the build configuration and defines added for integral type sizes. Patch from Dave Viner (dviner at apache dot org). Raptor 1.4.3 Changes A release with the major new feature of an XML writer API. This is now used along with a new supporting XML element class to improve the existing RDF/XML serializer and to provide a new [RSS 1.0](http://purl.org/rss/1.0/spec) serializer.  This API it is also used by the next release of [Rasqal](https://librdf.org/rasqal/) to provide serializing of query results to XML.  The new `raptor_xml_writer` class functions added are: `raptor_new_xml_writer` (constructor), `raptor_free_xml_writer` (destructor), `raptor_xml_writer_empty_element`, `raptor_xml_writer_start_element`, `raptor_xml_writer_end_element`, `raptor_xml_writer_cdata`, `raptor_xml_writer_cdata_counted`, `raptor_xml_writer_raw`, `raptor_xml_writer_raw_counted`, `raptor_xml_writer_comment` and `raptor_xml_writer_comment_counted`.  The new `raptor_xml_element` class functions added are: `raptor_new_xml_element` (constructor), `raptor_free_xml_element` (destructor), `raptor_xml_element_get_name`, `raptor_xml_element_set_attributes`, `raptor_xml_element_declare_namespace` and `raptor_iostream_write_xml_element`. Parser Changes RSS tag soup parser now works with older libxml2s (2.5.10+), including the one shipped with some Apple OSX versions that has an inconsistent header file and library.  RSS tag soup parser recognises/scores more common XML RSS file names.  RSS tag soup parser turns XML RSS `<guid isPermaLink="true">val</guid>` into RDF/XML form `<guid rdf:resource="val"/>`, leaving the non isPermaLink form to be a literal value.  A bug was found in libxml2 that causes double expanding of XML entities in RDF/XML. This has been reported but cannot be worked around from raptor. The expat XML parser can be used as an alternative, as it does not have this problem. A test was added for this bug but it will not cause the test suite ('make check') to fail.  Added additional [Turtle](https://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/) parser tests that cover Notation 3 syntax that is not part of the Turtle language.  Added `raptor_parser_set_feature_string` and `raptor_parser_get_feature_string` methods to set/get string feature values. Serializer Changes Added feature `relative_uris` for serializers. This is used by the RDF/XML serializer and enabled by default.  Added feature `start_uri` for serializers with a string value to set the start URI for serializing. Not used at present.  Added new methods `raptor_serializer_features_enumerate` to list serializer features and functions to set/get serializer feature integer or strings values: `raptor_serializer_set_feature`, `raptor_serializer_get_feature`, `raptor_serializer_set_feature_string` and `raptor_serializer_get_feature_string`.  Added `raptor_serialize_set_namespace` to allow user declaration of prefix/URI namespaces pairs as serializing hints.  the RDF/XML serializer was improved using the new XML Writer class so it now uses any user-declared namespace hints in it's output and emits relative URIs whenever possible. The latter was provided by a patch from RenÃ© Puls.  A new [RSS 1.0](http://purl.org/rss/1.0/spec) serializer was added, using the new XML Writer class and using the same structures, classes and properties as the RSS tag soup parser. URI class changes Added relative URI generating code from a patch written by RenÃ© Puls and provide this with two new methods `raptor_uri_to_relative_uri_string` and `raptor_uri_to_relative_counted_uri_string`.  Added `raptor_uri_print` to print a URI to a file handle.  Added methods `raptor_uri_to_string` and `raptor_uri_to_counted_string` to return a URI as newly allocated strings. I/O Stream Changes Many classes gained methods to write to iostreams, supporting the new XML Writer class functionality. The added methods are: `raptor_iostream_write_namespace`, `raptor_iostream_write_ntriples_string`, `raptor_iostream_write_qname`, `raptor_iostream_write_statement_ntriples`, `raptor_iostream_write_stringbuffer`, `raptor_iostream_write_xml_element` and `raptor_iostream_write_xml_escaped_string`. Namespace Class Changes Added `raptor_namespace_copy` copy constructor and `raptor_new_namespace_from_uri` constructor to build a namespace from a raptor\_uri object.  Added utility function `raptor_new_namespace_parts_from_string` to decode syntax of the form `xmlns:`*prefix*`="`*uri*`"` into *prefix* and *uri* string pairs.  Added `raptor_namespaces_find_namespace_by_uri` method for namespace stack to find a declared namespace by URI. This complements `raptor_namespaces_find_namespace` which already provides searching by prefix. Unicode and UTF-8 Changes Added several methods for checking characters forming parts of XML 1.0 or XML 1.1 names: `raptor_unicode_is_xml10_namestartchar`, `raptor_unicode_is_xml11_namestartchar`, `raptor_unicode_is_xml10_namechar` and `raptor_unicode_is_xml11_namechar`.  Added a function `raptor_utf8_check` to check that a string is legal UTF-8 and all the encoded Unicode characters are in the range U+0 <= character <= U+10FFFF  Added a function `raptor_xml_name_check` to check that a string is a legal XML name (1.0 or 1.1) as well as legal UTF-8. Other Changes Feature support: Added `raptor_feature_value_type` to determine value of a feature - either integer (most) or string.  XML QName class: Added `raptor_qname_copy` copy constructor.  Sequence class: Added `raptor_sequence_join` to join two sequences of items, leaving one empty.  Statement class: Added `raptor_statement_copy` copy constructor and `raptor_free_statement` destructor. Previously these were internal to raptor.  The `rapper` utility was modified to add a feature form: `-f xmlns:`*PREFIX*`="`*URI*`"` allowing the setting of output serializer namespaces.  The namespace URI string constants exported by raptor are now of type unsigned char\*. Raptor 1.4.2 Changes Make `raptor_xml_escape_string` fail correctly when given bad UTF-8 to escape. Raptor 1.4.1 Changes Fixed a buffer overrun in decoding a URI scheme in `raptor_uri` constructors such as `raptor_new_uri`.  Fixed a crash in RSS enclosures crash when the `url` attribute seen on a non-`<enclosure>` element  `raptor_xml_escape_string` return value has changed to be an int, returning <0 on failure. This allows the empty string encoding an empty string case to work and be distinguished from an error. Raptor 1.4.0 Changes A release with the major new feature of providing serializing of RDF triples to syntaxes. It also added a new support class for I/O streams and had other minor fixes.  Added a Raptor Serializer class (`raptor_serializer`) with similar style to Parser (`raptor_parser`). Two serializers are provided, for RDF/XML and N-Triples. The serializing can be done to files, C `FILE*` or to strings. The raptor\_iostream class that provides this also allows writing to any other form by creating a custom iostream.  The new raptor\_serializer class functions added are: `raptor_serializers_enumerate`, `raptor_serializer_syntax_name_check`, `raptor_new_serializer`, `raptor_free_serializer`, `raptor_serialize_start`, `raptor_serialize_start_to_filename`, `raptor_serialize_start_to_string`, `raptor_serialize_start_to_file_handle`, `raptor_serialize_statement`, `raptor_serialize_end`, `raptor_serializer_get_iostream`, `raptor_serializer_set_error_handler`, `raptor_serializer_set_warning_handler` and `raptor_serializer_get_locator`  Added a Raptor I/O stream abstraction in `raptor_iostream` class to support serializing of RDF to multiple output streams such as to filenames, to C standard I/O `FILE*` handles and to strings especially for cross-language use. A `raptor_iostream_handler` can be used to construct a user-defined iostream.  The new raptor\_iostream class functions added are: `raptor_new_iostream_from_handler`, `raptor_new_iostream_to_sink`, `raptor_new_iostream_to_filename`, `raptor_new_iostream_to_file_handle`, `raptor_new_iostream_to_string`, `raptor_free_iostream`, `raptor_iostream_write_bytes`, `raptor_iostream_write_byte`, `raptor_iostream_write_end`, `raptor_iostream_write_string`, `raptor_iostream_write_counted_string`, `raptor_iostream_get_bytes_written_count`, `raptor_iostream_write_decimal` and `raptor_iostream_format_hexadecimal`.  The `rapper` utility was modified to use serializer class so that the output formats supported are now N-Triples (`-o ntriples`) - the default, and RDF/XML (`-o rdfxml`).  Raptor now exports more static namespace URI strings for general application use: `raptor_xml_namespace_uri`, `raptor_rdf_namespace_uri`, `raptor_rdf_schema_namespace_uri`, `raptor_xmlschema_datatypes_namespace_uri`, `raptor_owl_namespace_uri`, and the length `raptor_rdf_namespace_uri_len`.  The raptor\_stringbuffer class gained a new method `raptor_stringbuffer_copy_to_string` which allows efficient copy-out of a constructed string.  The raptor\_www class gained a new method `raptor_www_fetch_to_string` to allow retrieving of web content as a single string.  RSS tag soup parser gained support for generating triples for enclosures, after a patch from Suzan Foster. Changes made include correcting the enclosures namespace and tidying some memory leaks. Raptor 1.3.3 Changes A release with major improvements along with several minor fixes.  Raptor's License was changed from LGPL 2.1/MPL 1.1 to LGPL 2.1/Apache 2  Thanks to Chris Pointon for several patches to make Raptor easier to build under Win32 which were applied, with some slight modifications.  Increased WWW content retrieval buffer size from 256 bytes to 4K since this was causing problems for even moderate size documents.  After testing raptor on a very large RDF/XML file with many `rdf:ID` values, the check for duplicate values was found to be inefficient in memory and slow. The implementation was improved to be more memory efficient and a new parser feature `check_rdf_id` was added to disable checking (default is enabled).  Added a new Unicode NFC checker to replace the functionality formally available by calling the GNOME glib function g\_utf8\_normalize. This new checker is done via several tables and adds approximately 50K to the object size of the library when compiled on x86. This code and tables can be disabled with configure option `--disable-nfc-check` causing all checks to succeed.  Fix the exporting of `raptor_xml_literal_datatype_uri_string` and `raptor_xml_literal_datatype_uri_string_len` as constants for use by applications. Previously raptor.h wasn't doing this correctly.  Added `raptor_calloc_memory` for allocating zeroed memory inside raptor, for use by applications passing memory in/out of raptor.  Added a new configure option `--enable-parsers` to allow the selection of the required RDF parsers from any of those supported (RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples, RSS tag soup).  Reorganised the sources to split parsing support from RDF/XML to support compiling without this parser.  Updated the RSS Tag Soup parser to start to handle the Atom 0.3 currently being standardised by the [IETF Atom Publishing Format and Protocol](http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html) working group.  Altered the Turtle parser to work with large source documents that exceeded bison limits. Thanks to Geoff Chappell for providing a fix for this.  Rewrote the URI parsing to create an internal structure and improved the relative URI resolving in preparation for future work such as potentially supporting URI canonicalisation such as proposed to be used by Atom. Raptor 1.3.2 Changes A release with some minor fixes.  Added a new configure option `--with-expat-source=`*DIR* to allow the use of external expat source trees in either the old or newer directory structure style. (Patch from Mark Smith).  Added `raptor_alloc_memory` for handlers that need to allocate memory in the same heap as raptor uses for `raptor_free_memory`. This is mostly useful for allocating memory that is freed by raptor in error, ID and statement handlers on win32 which has separate heaps for different DLLs.  A bug was fixed where errors which happened when fetching WWW content were always printed to stderr. They are now passed to the main error routines which allows applications to retrieve them.  Accessor functions were added for parts of the public `raptor_locator` structure which makes it possible to get structured error information from language bindings via Redland (Patch from Edd Dumbill). The new functions are:   * `int raptor_locator_line(raptor_locator *locator);` * `int raptor_locator_column(raptor_locator *locator);` * `int raptor_locator_byte(raptor_locator *locator);` * `const char * raptor_locator_file(raptor_locator *locator);` * `const char * raptor_locator_uri(raptor_locator *locator);`   The Unicode Normal Form C (NFC) checking via the GNOME glib library function `g_utf8_normalize` is broken, comparing the data it says is failed against other NFC checkers. It is also slower than need be since it is doing full normalizing rather than just checking for NFC, and adds a rather large dependency for just one function. A new portable checker will be added in a later release. Raptor 1.3.1 Changes A release primarily to fix some win32 and portability issues.  raptor.h now includes stdarg.h  Corrected the `raptor_print_statement` declaration in raptor.h for the argument statement to have one less 'const' which matches the actual code.  Made several portability fixes for compiling natively on win32 which doesn't quite do POSIX or C99.  Changed the support for file: URIs and converting to and from filenames. It now %-escapes spaces and % characters on conversion to and from filenames with `raptor_uri_uri_string_to_filename`, `raptor_uri_uri_string_to_filename_fragment` and `raptor_uri_filename_to_uri_string`. For Win32, more tests were added and the format of URIs supported corrected to use the `file:///c:` form rather than `file://c|/`  URIs that resolve to directories now return an error when lstat is available to check. Parser Changes The [Turtle](https://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/) parser was updated to only allow language with non-datatyped literals, allow a '\_' immediately after a ':' in qnames and to make a bare ':' qname work correctly.  The Turtle parser was fixed to re-initialise correctly when performing multiple parsings. The other parsers already did this correctly.  Added a warning to the RDF/XML parser for unknown `rdf:parseType` values, when parsing in lax mode - which is the default. It now tells the user when the parsing is working as 'Literal' mode by finding an unknown value. This is controlled by a new parser feature warn\_other\_parsetypes which is default set true in lax mode. Parser modes are controlled by the `raptor_set_parser_strict` method. Raptor 1.3.0 Changes A release primarily to provide support for the new [Rasqal](https://librdf.org/rasqal/) RDF query library but with some new features and fixes. Parser Changes Added a new constructor `raptor_new_parser_for_content` to guess the parser to use from hints in URIs or content, using a new utility function `raptor_guess_parser_name`.  Additional checks were added to the RDF/XML parser for RDF-namespaced names in element and attributes and if they are forbidden giving an error otherwise if unknown, giving a warning.  The [Turtle](https://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/) parser was updated to correct the collections syntax, allow '-' in names and QNames and to add integer literals. This parser now correctly uses `raptor_generate_id` when a blank identifier name is needed.  Completed parser feature support by adding `raptor_get_feature`, `raptor_feature_from_uri`, and `raptor_features_enumerate` to get values and enable discovery of supported features at run time. `raptor_set_feature` was changed to give return a success value  Added a new method `raptor_get_mime_type` to get the MIME type of the syntax for a parser  `raptor_parse_uri_with_connection` (which is called by `raptor_parse_uri`) now sets the HTTP `Accept:` header to the MIME type of the parser in WWW requests using the new `raptor_www_set_http_accept()`. `rapper` changes Added options `-f`/`--feature` for setting features and `-g`/`--guess` for guessing syntax from some content or identifiers. See [rapper(1)](rapper.html) for all rapper options. Utility function changes Added `raptor_syntax_name_check` to check for valid syntax language names.  Added `raptor_free_memory` to free memory returned by raptor functions.  Added Unicode utility functions `raptor_unicode_char_to_utf8` and `raptor_utf8_to_unicode_char`.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-02-16 16:46:58 UTC  ``` A XML External Entity (XXE) flaw was found in the way raptor, an Resource Description Framework (RDF) parser toolkit, processed certain RDF/XML format based input files. If an attacker provided a specially-crafted RDF file, and tricked the local user into parsing it, it could lead to local file inclusion, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user parsing the file (privileges of the "rapper" executable or privileges of an application, linked against the librdf library).  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Timothy D. Morgan of VSR for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-02-16 19:24:01 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of the openoffice.org package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  --  This issue affects the version of the raptor package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the raptor package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5.  --  This issue affects the versions of the raptor package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16.  --  This issue affects the version of the raptor2 package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c11)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-14 16:27:18 UTC  ``` Preliminary embargo date for public disclosure of this issue has been set up to Thursday, March 22, 2012 at 12:00 UTC time.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c15)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-22 14:09:25 UTC  ``` Public now via: <http://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2012-0037.html> <http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2012/03/22/tdf-announces-libreoffice-3-4-6/> <http://www.libreoffice.org/advisories/CVE-2012-0037/>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c16)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-22 14:13:57 UTC  ``` Created raptor tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 805938](show_bug.cgi?id=805938 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-0037 raptor: XML External Entity (XXE) attack by processing certain RDF files [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c17)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-22 14:15:32 UTC  ``` Created raptor tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 805941](show_bug.cgi?id=805941 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-0037 raptor: XML External Entity (XXE) attack by processing certain RDF files [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c18)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-22 14:16:33 UTC  ``` Created raptor2 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-16 [[bug 805944](show_bug.cgi?id=805944 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-0037 raptor: XML External Entity (XXE) attack by processing certain RDF files [fedora-16]")]   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-03-22 17:28:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0410 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0410.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-03-22 18:43:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0411 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0411.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=791296#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2012-03-26 08:13:00 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://vsecurity.com/resources/advisory/20120324-1/> <http://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2012-0037.html> <http://www.libreoffice.org/advisories/CVE-2012-0037/>   ``` |  |

# LibreOffice: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in LibreOffice, allowing
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/libreoffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.5.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.5.5.3** |

| Package | **app-office/libreoffice-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.5.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.5.5.3** |

### Background

LibreOffice is a full office productivity suite.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in LibreOffice:

* The Microsoft Word Document parser contains an out-of-bounds read
  error (CVE-2011-2713).
* The Raptor RDF parser contains an XML External Entity expansion error
  (CVE-2012-0037).
* The graphic loading parser contains an integer overflow error which
  could cause a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2012-1149).
* Multiple errors in the XML manifest handling code could cause a
  heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2665).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document file using LibreOffice, possibly resulting in execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service
condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LibreOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-3.5.5.3"

```

All users of the LibreOffice binary package should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-3.5.5.3"

```

\*\* This privacy policy is currently being adopted and may not yet be fully implemented at all websites \*\*

This Privacy Policy clarifies the nature, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data
(hereinafter referred to as âDataâ) within our online offering and the related websites, features
and content, as well as external online presence, e.g. our social media profiles on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites
(collectively referred to as âonline presenceâ).
With regard to the terminology we use, e.g. âProcessingâ or âResponsibleâ,
we refer to the definitions in Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. Name and contact details of the controller and the company data protection officer

This privacy policy applies to data processing by:

Responsible:

## 2. Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use

### a) When visiting the website

#### Log files

When you visit our websites ([full list of domains](/policies/asf-domains.html)) or one of our subdomains,
the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website.
This information is temporarily stored in a log file.
The following information is being collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:

* The IP address of the requesting computer
* The date and time of access
* The name and URL of the retrieved file
* The website from which access is made (referrer URL)
* Geo information of the location from which access is made
* The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer and the name of your access provider

The data mentioned are processed by us for the following purposes:

* Ensuring connectivity of our website
* Ensuring a use of our website, of which we think is comfortable for you
* Evaluation of system security and stability
* Other administrative purposes

The retention time for this data is 90 days.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above.
In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you.
In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when you visit our website.
Further details can be found under no. 4 and 5 of this privacy policy.

#### Matomo

In addition to log files, some of our websites use Matomo to understand what parts of the
website are important to our users, what features are most frequently accessed,
where users get lost in the documentation, etc.
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website,
and the docs and where to focus improvements next.

The collected information consists of the following:

* The IP address from which you access the website
* The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site
* The date and time you access our site
* The pages you visit
* If you click on any of the file download links on our website
* The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site
* The addresses of pages you go to from our site
* The search terms you use on the website

This information is gathered and stored using the open source software Matomo. We donât
use any cookies to collect this information. An IP address is anonymized by removing
the last two octets from the IP address. That means that if your IP is 192.168.100.50,
we store it as 192.168.0.0.

Matomo is self-hosted on a virtual machine provided by the Apache Software Foundation.
It can only be accessed by members of the Apache Privacy committee. The data can be
viewed by anyone by visiting https://analytics.apache.org/.

Matomo respects any Do Not Track setting in your browser. You can also opt-out
from all Matomo tracking below.

### b) When registering for our newsletter and mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented,
we use your e-mail address to periodically send you our newsletter.
For the receipt of the newsletter the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

We inform our visitors at regular intervals through newsletters about news and offers from The Apache Software Foundation.

The newsletter of our Foundation can only be received if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person before the first time of sending the newsletter, using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address is the person who authorized the receipt of the newsletter.

When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for the newsletter is used exclusively to send our newsletter.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter/mailing list or technical changes.

There will be no transfer to third parties of the personal data collected as part of the newsletter service.

Subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
Consent to the storage of personal data that the person has given us for the newsletter dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of each newsletter email.

### c) When registering for our mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented, we use your e-mail address to send you messages arriving at our mailing lists.
For the receipt of the mailing list message the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

Visitors may communicate with us through our mailing lists.

The mailing list messages of our organisation can only be received if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the mailing list.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person for the first time using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address authorized the receipt of the mailing list messages.

When you subscribe to a mailing list, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.
When a mailing list is archived, the log file will be deleted.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for a mailing list will be used exclusively to send messages arriving at that mailing list.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the mailing list service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the mailing list or other technical changes.

We will not actively transfer to third parties any personal data as part of the mailing list service.
However, almost all of our mailing lists are of a public nature.

This means, your name and email may be exposed to the public.
Also, all information you send to a mailing list will be exposed to the public.
Third parties may collect this information and process it separately.
The sender of messages is responsible if they expose their personal data to the public.

All content sent to mailing lists is archived indefinitely.
By using our mailing list service, you agree that any content is archived in that way.

Subscription to our mailing lists may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
The consent to the storage of personal data that a person has given us for the mailing list dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of every email.

## 3. Disclosure of data

Transfer of your personal data to third parties for purposes other than those listed below does not take place.
We only share your personal information with third parties if:

* You, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR, have given express consent to this.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR is required to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have a predominantly legitimate interest in not disclosing your data.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR is a legal obligation.
* As permitted by law and according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, disclosure is required for the settlement of contractual relationships with you.

## 4. External service providers

The Apache Software Foundation uses the following external service providers who help to optimize its services.
Insofar as these service providers process data on behalf of The Apache Software Foundation, agreements have been concluded with them which set the European data protection standards as binding and, in particular, prohibit the use of the data for other purposes.
If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called âcontract processing contractâ, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.

## 5. Social Media Plug-ins

We rely on our website on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR social plug-ins from the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to make our company better known.
The underlying commercial purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR.
Responsibility for operation compliant with data protection is to be guaranteed by the respective providers.
The integration of these plug-ins by us is done by means of the so-called two-click method to protect visitors to our website in the best possible way.

### a) YouTube

On our website we have integrated components from YouTube.
YouTube is an internet video portal that allows video publishers to freely watch video clips provided by other users for free viewing, rating and commenting.
YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, so that both complete film and television broadcasts, music videos, trailers and user-made videos uploaded via the YouTube internet portal are available.

YouTubeâs operating company is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Each visit to one of the pages of this site operated by the controller and incorporating a YouTube component (YouTube video) will automatically cause the Internet browser on the subjectâs information technology system to download an illustration of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube.
More information about YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/.
As part of this technical process, YouTube and Google are aware of the specific location of our site visited by the person concerned.
If the person visiting our site is logged in to YouTube at the same time, YouTube calls a sub-page containing a YouTube video for the person visiting our site.
This information is collected by YouTube and Google and associated with the individual YouTube account.

YouTube and Google will always receive information through the YouTube component that a person has visited our website if the person is logged into YouTube at the time of access to our website; this happens regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not.
If such transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not wanted by the person visiting our site, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their YouTube account before visiting our website.

YouTubeâs privacy policy, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/, identifies the collection, processing, and use of personally identifiable information by YouTube and Google.

## 9. Data security

We use the popular SSL (Secure Socket Layer) method during your site visit, in conjunction with the highest level of encryption supported by your browser.
In general, this is a 256-bit encryption.
If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3 technology instead.
Whether a single page of our website is encrypted is shown by the closed representation of the key or lock icon in the lower status bar of your browser.

We also take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or total loss, destruction or unauthorized access by third parties.
Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.

## 10. Updating and changing this privacy policy

## Topic

Updated raptor packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

Raptor provides parsers for Resource Description Framework (RDF) files.

An XML External Entity expansion flaw was found in the way Raptor processed
RDF files. If an application linked against Raptor were to open a
specially-crafted RDF file, it could possibly allow a remote attacker to
obtain a copy of an arbitrary local file that the user running the
application had access to. A bug in the way Raptor handled external

Posted in [Announcements](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/category/announcements/) By [Italo Vignoli](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/author/italovignoli/ "Posts by Italo Vignoli") On March 22, 2012

Berlin, March 22, 2012 – The Document Foundation (TDF) announces LibreOffice 3.4.6, solving a potential security problem and a number of bugs of the program.

LibreOffice 3.4.6 is available for immediate download from the following link:<http://www.libreoffice.org/download/?version=3.4.6>

Change logs are available at <http://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/src/bugfixes-libreoffice-3-4-6-release-3.4.6.1.log> (fixed in 3.4.6.1) and <http://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/src/bugfixes-libreoffice-3-4-6-release-3.4.6.2.log> (fixed in 3.4.6.2).

Informations on the potential security problem are available on the advisory page: [CVE-2012-0037](https://www.libreoffice.org/advisories/CVE-2012-0037/).

| Affected versions | < **4.2.5.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.5.2** |

### Background

OpenOffice is the open source version of StarOffice, a full office
productivity suite. LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice and
Libreoffice. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
using OpenOffice, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition, execution
of arbitrary Python code, authentication bypass, or reading and writing
of arbitrary files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-3.5.5.3"

```

All LibreOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-4.2.5.2"

```

All LibreOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-4.2.5.2"

```

We recommend that users unmerge OpenOffice:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-office/openoffice"

```

Since this issue was discussed on the distros list prior to its public
disclosure, I think it must be on oss-security now.  Besides, I'll need
to post a follow-up on its handling.  Hence the forward.

I've just updated <http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros>
to say:

"When the security issue is finally to be made public, it is your (the
original reporter's) responsibility to post about it to oss-security
(indeed, you and others may also post to any other mailing lists, etc.)"

Product Description
~-----------------~
"Raptor is a free software / Open Source C library that provides a set of
 parsers and serializers that generate Resource Description Framework (RDF)
 triples by parsing syntaxes or serialize the triples into a syntax. The
 supported parsing syntaxes are RDF/XML, N-Quads, N-Triples, TRiG, Turtle, RSS
 tag soup including all versions of RSS, Atom 1.0 and 0.3, GRDDL and
 microformats for HTML, XHTML and XML and RDFa. The serializing syntaxes are
 RDF/XML (regular, and abbreviated), Atom 1.0, GraphViz, JSON, N-Quads,
 N-Triples, RSS 1.0 and XMP." -- libraptor web site [1]

libraptor is a component of librdf[2] which is used by a variety of open source
software to interpret Resource Description Framework (RDF) [3] formats.

Vulnerability Overview
~--------------------~
In December 2011, VSR identified a vulnerability in multiple open source office
products (including OpenOffice, LibreOffice, KOffice, and AbiWord) due to unsafe
interpretation of XML files with custom entity declarations. Deeper analysis
revealed that the vulnerability was caused by acceptance of external entities by
the libraptor library, which is used by librdf and is in turn used by these
office products.

In the context of office applications, these vulnerabilities could allow for XML
External Entity (XXE) attacks resulting in file theft and a loss of user privacy
when opening potentially malicious ODF documents.  For other applications which
depend on librdf or libraptor, potentially serious consequences could result
from accepting RDF/XML content from untrusted sources, though the impact may
vary widely depending on the context.

Vulnerability Details
~-------------------~
Open Document Format (ODF) files consist of a collection of several different
files stored in a ZIP archive.  Included in this set is a "manifest.rdf" file
which is formatted according to the RDF/XML representation.  The RDF format is
intended to be used for storing metadata associated with specific document
elements.  The manifest.rdf file can reference secondary RDF files within the
ODF file as well as external document schemas.

The RDF file parser (librdf) used by the affected office products allows DTD
specifications within the RDF files themselves.  In addition, the parser
interprets external entities which may reference arbitrary external files, HTTP
and FTP resources.

For instance, the following "evil.rdf" file was created within a valid ODF text
archive (.odt file) which was referenced by the internal manifest.rdf file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE rdf [
   <!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/win.ini">
]>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="[http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns)">
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="content.xml#id1265690860">
    <ns0:comment
xmlns:ns0="[http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema)">&file;</ns0:comment>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

Upon opening the malicious .odt file in OpenOffice for Windows, the
c:\windows\win.ini file was read and included in the document metadata.  Upon
saving the document, this metadata was included literally in the resulting
evil.rdf file (within the .odt):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="[http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns)">
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="content.xml#id1265690860">
    <ns1:comment xmlns:ns1="[http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#](http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema)">; for

</ns1:comment>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

The malicious XML entities could also include URLs to attacker-controlled
HTTP or FTP resources.  This would allow an attacker to determine when a
document was opened, potentially resulting in reduced privacy.  However, based
on current analysis of the affected office applications, the most serious attack
scenario is likely to be:

1. Attacker posts a malicious file on a web site or sends file to victim.  The
file contains a form for the victim to fill out and return to the attacker.

2. Victim fills out the form, saves it, sends it back to the attacker.

3. Attacker is able to read the contents of any stolen files as embedded
metadata, simply by unzipping the returned file and reading the malicious RDF
component.

This attack clearly requires some significant user interaction.  However, other
applications which rely on librdf/libraptor have not been analyzed.  It is
plausible that the context of the external entity interpretation in other
software could allow for more serious automated file retrieval attacks.

Versions Affected
~---------------~
The 1.x and 2.x major versions of librdf are affected.

Thus far, all recent versions of open source office products appear to be
affected, since these products rely on librdf/raptor for the interpretation of
RDF files.  This, in turn relies on libxml2 which supports external entity
interpretation by default. OpenOffice and LibreOffice include a modified copy of
librdf 1.x which was vulnerable at the time of testing.  It is likely that all
previously release 3.x versions of OpenOffice and LibreOffice are vulnerable.
AbiWord and KOffice rely on a copy of librdf which is installed by the
underlying operating system.

Numerous other open source software packages depend on librdf or libraptor
(including ardour, libslv2, lv2file, morla, soprano, and numerous
language-specific wrappers), but it is not known if these are exploitable in any
realistic scenario.

Vendor Response
~-------------~
The following timeline provides an overview of communication with the primary
affected vendors:

2012-01-09    OpenOffice, LibreOffice, AbiWord, KOffice, and libraptor
              maintainers were provided a draft advisory and test sample.
              The OpenWall "distros" mailing list was also notified.
              Apache OpenOffice Security team acknowledged notification.
              libraptor developer confirmed flaw.

2012-01-10    CVE-2012-0037 assigned by Apache.

2012-02-02    Notified OpenWall "distros" mailing list again, due to previous
              technical problems.

2012-02-04    libraptor developer provided patches to all notified parties.

2012-02-22    Extensive arguing between vendors about embargo/release date.

2012-03-06    More arguing about release date.

2012-03-14    Agreed upon release date established.

2012-03-22    Security updates and vendor advisories released.

2012-03-24    VSR advisory released.

Recommendation
~------------~
Users of most open source operating system distributions should update to the
latest librdf package as soon as possible, once a patched version is available
for their distribution.  OpenOffice and LibreOffice packages should also be
upgraded, since these include a custom copy of the library.

Users of other operating systems who use LibreOffice or OpenOffice should
upgrade these packages to the latest release versions as soon as possible.

Developers of software which rely on librdf or libraptor should assess the risk
of XXE attacks on interpreted XML files and take appropriate actions to notify
their users based on how their software operates.  VSR would be happy to assist
developers in these efforts on a case-by-case basis.

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Information
~----------------------------------------------------~
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the number CVE-2012-0037 to this issue.  This is a candidate for
inclusion in the CVE list (<http://cve.mitre.org>), which standardizes
names for security problems.

Acknowledgements
~--------------~
Thanks to Leper for help in preliminary testing.

Thanks to Jan iankko Lieskovsky, Daniel Veillard, Caol?n McNamara, and Michael
Stahl for performing deeper analysis on the interaction between libraptor and
libxml2.

## The Document Foundation

* It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law (gemeinnÃ¼tzige rechtsfÃ¤hige Stiftung des bÃ¼rgerlichen Rechts).
* It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community.
* It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users.
* It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities.
* It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community.

The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice"), the next evolution of the world’s leading free office suite, and [The Document Liberation Project](https://www.documentliberation.org/ "The Document Liberation Project"), a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format.

### Donate

LibreOffice is made possible by the efforts of thousands of volunteers around the globe, and by the generosity of donors. [Please support our efforts: your donation helps us to deliver a better product!](https://www.libreoffice.org/donate/)

### Become a TDF Member

If you are one of the volunteers contributing to the LibreOffice or Document Liberation projects, you should consider the opportunity of becoming a [member](/members/) of The Document Foundation, by filling the [application form](https://membership.documentfoundation.org/).

### The Bodies of the Foundation

The formal bodies of the Foundation are:

* The [Board of Directors](/board/) (or “BoD”). The Foundation’s Board of Directors is the main administration of the Foundation’s projects and teams. Board members are the foundation’s judicial and extrajudicial representatives.
* The [Membership Committee](/mc/) (or “MC”). Mission of the MC is to administer membership applications and renewals and to oversee election of the BoD.
* The [Board of Trustees](/members/) (or “Members”). The Board of Trustees consists of all people actively contributing to the Foundation’s projects. To be acknowledged as a member you need to meet the [criteria defined in our statutes](/statutes/) and apply for membership using our [application form](https://membership.documentfoundation.org/).

### Other entities and officers

There are some entities to help the BoD to further the foundation’s projects, but not being formal bodies of the foundation:

* The [TDF team](/team/) oversees various projects, and supports the community in their work.
* The [Engineering Steering Committee](/engineering-sc/) (or “ESC”) provides technological guidance on strategic matters and hypothetically will consist of the Community’s best engineers.
* The [Advisory Board](/advisory-board/) (or “AB”) provides a forum for organizations providing a substantial minimum level of financial or other support as determined by the BoD, to meet with the BoD and provide advice.

The BoD may appoint officers for administration or daily business of the Foundation.

### CVE-2012-0037

**Title:** CVE-2012-0037: XML Entity Expansion flaw by processing RDF file

**Announced:** March 22 2012

**Fixed in:** LibreOffice 3.4.6/3.5.1

**Description:**

An XML Entity Expansion flaw was found in the way embedded Raptor library processed certain RDF and other XML-based format files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted file in an affected LibreOffice format which when opened could cause arbitrary code execution or local file inclusion.

Thanks to Timothy D. Morgan of VSR for reporting this flaw. Users are recommended to upgrade to 3.4.6 or 3.5.1 to avoid this flaw

### CVE-2012-0037

**Title:** CVE-2012-0037: XML Entity Expansion flaw by processing RDF file

**Announced:** March 22 2012

**Fixed in:** LibreOffice 3.4.6/3.5.1

**Description:**

An XML Entity Expansion flaw was found in the way embedded Raptor library processed certain RDF and other XML-based format files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted file in an affected LibreOffice format which when opened could cause arbitrary code execution or local file inclusion.

Thanks to Timothy D. Morgan of VSR for reporting this flaw. Users are recommended to upgrade to 3.4.6 or 3.5.1 to avoid this flaw

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0411)

## Topic

Updated openoffice.org packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenOffice.org is an office productivity suite that includes desktop
applications, such as a word processor, spreadsheet application,
presentation manager, formula editor, and a drawing program. OpenOffice.org
embeds a copy of Raptor, which provides parsers for Resource Description
Framework (RDF) files.

An XML External Entity expansion flaw was found in the way Raptor processed
RDF files. If OpenOffice.org were to open a specially-crafted file (such
as an OpenDocument Format or OpenDocument Presentation file), it could
possibly allow a remote attacker to obtain a copy of an arbitrary local
file that the user running OpenOffice.org had access to. A bug in the way
Raptor handled external entities could cause OpenOffice.org to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
OpenOffice.org. (CVE-2012-0037)

Red Hat would like to thank Timothy D. Morgan of VSR for reporting this
issue.

All OpenOffice.org users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct this issue. All running
instances of OpenOffice.org applications must be restarted for this update
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [CVE-2012-0037](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2012-0037)

### OpenOffice.org data leakage vulnerability

#### Severity: Important

#### Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

#### Versions Affected:

+ OpenOffice.org 3.3 and 3.4 Beta, on all platforms.
+ Earlier versions may be also affected.

#### Description:

Description: An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is possible in the above versions of OpenOffice.org. This vulnerability exploits the way in
which external entities are processed in certain XML components of ODF documents. By crafting an external entity to refer to other local file system
resources, an attacker would be able to inject contents of other locally- accessible files into the ODF document, without the user's knowledge or permission. Data leakage then becomes possible when that document is later distributed to other parties.

#### Mitigation

OpenOffice.org 3.3.0 and 3.4 beta users can patch their installation with the following patches. Download, unzip and follow the instructions in the enclosed readme.pdf file.

+ [For Windows installs](http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/ooo/3.3/patches/cve-2012-0037/CVE-2012-0037-win.zip)
  ([MD5](http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/ooo/3.3/patches/cve-2012-0037/CVE-2012-0037-win.zip.md5))
  ([SHA1](http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/ooo/3.3/patches/cve-2012-0037/CVE-2012-0037-win.zip.sha1))
+ [For MacOS installs](http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/ooo/3.3/patches/cve-2012-0037/CVE-2012-0037-mac.zip)
  ([MD5](http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/ooo/3.3/patches/cve-2012-0037/CVE-2012-0037-mac.zip.md5))
  ([SHA1](http://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/ooo/3.3/patches/cve-2012-0037/CVE-2012-0037-mac.zip.sha1))
+ Linux and other platforms should consult their distro or OS vendor for patch instructions.

This vulnerability is also fixed in Apache OpenOffice 3.4 dev snapshots since March 1st, 2012.

#### Verifying the Integrity of Downloaded Files

We have provided MD5 and SHA1 hashes of these patches, as well as a detached digital signature, for those who wish to verify the integrity of these files.

The MD5 and SHA1 hashes can be verified using Unix tools like sha1, sha1sum or md5sum.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the [KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/openoffice/KEYS) file, as well as the asc signature file for the particular patch from above. Make sure you get these files from the main distribution directory, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures as follows:

`% pgpk -a KEYS

% pgpv CVE-2012-0037-{win|mac}.zip.asc`
*or*

`% pgp -ka KEYS

% pgp CVE-2012-0037-{win|mac}.zip.asc`
*or*

`% gpg --import KEYS

% gpg --verify CVE-2012-0037-{win|mac}.zip.asc`
#### Source and Building

Information on obtaining the source code for this patch, and for porting it or adapting it to OpenOffice.org
derivatives can be found [here](CVE-2012-0037-src.txt).

| Description | The documentation for the function librdf\_query\_languages\_enumerate (http://librdf.org/docs/api/redland-query.html#librdf-query-languages-enumerate) lists this function as deprecated, and suggests using librdf\_query\_language\_get\_description() instead.  There doesn't seem to be a librdf\_query\_language\_get\_description function in the 1.0.13 source, and there's no mention of it in the online docs either. | | | | |
