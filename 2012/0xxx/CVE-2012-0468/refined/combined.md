How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-20

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:12.0/ rv:10.0.4)

Announced
April 24, 2012
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 12
* Firefox ESR 10.0.4
* SeaMonkey 2.9
* Thunderbird 12
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.4

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird
and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk
in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

### References

Firefox 11.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Duh, forgot to say what OS I'm using: Win 7, 32-bit JS shell debug build.

I can also reproduce the assertion on 32-bit js debug shell on Mac 10.7 m-c changeset c713003d3226.
autoBisect shows this is probably related to the following changeset:

Looked at this for a bit. We end up calling the write barrier on bogus memory off the end of the array. It's somehow caused by the sequence of length changes that happen with the pushes, shifts, and length-sets.Whiteboard: js-triage-needed → sg:critical

Attached patch

[WIP](attachment.cgi?id=592347&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=592347&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=714616&attachment=592347)

Got this with a lot of help from Bill. This gets us most of the way there, but I still need some advice wrt the methodjit.
Cause: The bug is basically in array\_shift, where it first moves elements down, then sets the array length. Let's say that at first, the array has initializedLength=3, length=4, and capacity=6, so that the elements are like this:
v1 v2 v3 xx // xx is uninitialized memory
In the current code, we move |length| elements down, giving this:
v2 v3 xx xx // xx is uninitialized memory
Next we decrement initializedLength to 2. This activates the write barrier for the element at index 2, but that's |xx|, so it potentially crashes.
But even more fundamentally, moving |length| elements is just wrong, because if |capacity < length|, the move could crash right away. We can fix this by instead moving |initializedLength-1| elements.
Methodjit question: So far, so good, but Bill further recommended asserting in moveDenseArrayElements that we aren't moving elements from beyond initializedLength, to make sure nothing like this happens elsewhere.
It turns out the assert trips on JM+TI's ArrayShift when called for shift. The problem is that the jitcode decrements initializedLength and after that calls the stub ArrayShift, which calls moveDenseArrayElements. In the example above, on entry to ArrayShift initializedLength is 2 and length is 3. ArrayShift calls moveDenseArrayElements(dest=0, start=1, len=2). That's the correct set of elements to move, but it trips the assert, even though it's actually safe because "really" we still have 3 elements initialized.
If we want to keep the strengthened assert, what's the best way to handle this in the methodjit? One thing I'm wondering about is why we have the jitcode for |shift| if it has to call a stub anyway. Should we just not use the jitcode for shift? Or should we not decrement in the jitcode. I think one way to paper over would be to increment initializedLength in ArrayShift before the move, then decrement it, which should work but is kind of ugly. Brian?Assignee: general → dmandelin

The stub used for shift is basically just a memmove, and even though a call is required there is a good savings from doing all the array maintenance in jitcode (numbers in [bug 692847](/show_bug.cgi?id=692847 "RESOLVED FIXED - Speed up Array.shift, and Array.{pop,shift} on empty arrays")). Updating the initialized length before the call is good because it makes shift() very similar to pop(), and faster since the registers holding the object/elements/etc. are clobbered by the call.
I think it might be better to just call a moveDenseArrayElementsForArrayShift or something which skips the assert, and comment on why it is needed.

I just noticed that we bail out of mjit::Compiler::compileArrayPopShift if write barriers are enabled. So we're wasting time by dealing with barriers at all in this call. Perhaps the best thing would be to add moveDenseArrayElementsUnbarriered. It would assert that write barriers aren't needed in the current compartment and then just do a memmove. Then the ArrayShift stub would call this. It fixes the bug and it's a speedup.

Could you put the original assertions from moveDenseArrayElements here (about the capacity)?
