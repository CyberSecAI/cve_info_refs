So if you have javascript enabled in *.sourceforge.net this PoC works in demo-page: <http://webcalendar.sourceforge.net/demo/view_entry.php?id=2142&date=20120212> and I also tested this in version 1.2.4 (modified 2011-08-09) and it works as stored XSS. Changelog for 1.2.4 says:

Version 1.2.4 (08 Aug 2011)
 - Fixed XSS vulnerability: malicious javascript in event descriptions submitted
   by public can do bad things (create admin account, delete events, etc.)
   when the pending event is viewed by the admin.
 - Fixed bug: PHP warnings on search
 - Removed PHP warnings
 - Bug fix: undefined function date_default_timezone_set in older versions
   of PHP.

I can't find release 1.2.5 from SF project-page nor in <http://www.k5n.us/downloads.php> or in news. If the code indeed has stored XSS in versions 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 there probably is more of them. SHA256 for WebCalendar-1.2.4.tar.gz is: 09dea6511bf692f08e08a1a6088e547517a11ba746dde6b5e2cd57bb0081cfee

At the moment download counts:
1.2.4 zip 8644
1.2.4 tar.gz 1838

Definitely needs a 2012 CVE-identifier.

This seems to be missing 2012 CVE.

Original report: <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2012/Jan/128>
Project page: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/>
Version affected: 1.2.4 (the newest)
Variable: location (stored)
Reported to developer without response: <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3472745&group_id=3870&atid=103870>

I can validate this if needed.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

So far as I could see the newest version is 1.2.3
(<http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/?source=directory> and
<http://www.k5n.us/webcalendar.php?topic=News> don't list 1.2.4)
