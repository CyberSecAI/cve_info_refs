Provided languages with moduleadmin in Frameworks, French, German and Russian must be removed.

Missing update packs from 2.5.5 Beta and RC to Final ?

Protector language files must be edited, to remove white spaces and to replace contants with DEFINE in order to be maintained with rest of the language files.

Install/Language/English/ - better to be in one file with DEFINE only for 2.5.6.

2 Files per module, 1 for core
eg. modules/pm/language/english/site.php and modules/pm/english/admin.php
all in language/english - in one english.php
mail\_templates/ to be moved within SQL and with option to be modified per module.
help/ - to be removed off installation and moved to help.xoops.org

Can you provide English version as a template for the others?

All the other suggestions will have to wait till XOOPS 2.6.0.

Can you please add them to the [Feature Requests](http://bit.ly/ae9h8n), so we won't forget? Thanks!

Protector definitions:
 `define($constpref."_ADMININDEX","Protect Center");`

Protector whitespaces:
 `define('_MD_PROTECTOR_YOUAREBADIP','You are registered as BAD_IP by Protector.') ;`

Line should look like:
 `define('_MD_PROTECTOR_YOUAREBADIP','You are registered as BAD_IP by Protector.');`

Standard XOOPS Define
 `define('_NOCOMMENTS', 'No Comments');`

From Portector must be removed spaces betwen ) and ;, all lines to end with CRLF and define($constpref. to be replaced by DEFINE.

If redhead install is ready, why the /install lang files to not be merged into one ... and for rest, no one will forget, I'll moan all the time :)

I am finishing up my semester then will be working on this. (Writing a card game in C# as my final project. Semester is done in 2 weeks.)

Hope to have it finished within 2-3 weeks when I am able to get back to it...

So with this in mind I am hoping to have the install system ready by the end of May.

Will support Language defines and themes.

I'll take care of the spaces.

But I still don't understand why do you want to use CRLF? Everybody is using LF - see these [Guidelines for Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.php-file-formatting.html#coding-standard.php-file-formatting.general) from the company that is in charge of PHP

> define('\_MD\_PROTECTOR\_YOUAREBADIP','You are registered as BAD\_IP by Protector.

I am reasonably fussy when it comes to coding semantics, but I don't know of a PHP or Apache version that would have a problem with the space at the end of that statement. The LF issue seems equally pedantic. Can someone explain exactly how is this likely to cause a problem?

The post by chnwalkman is completely understandable. I have never encountered a whitespace issue resulting from terminating PHP with the closing tag. I have however seen more than one corrupted file upload with half the code missing. Without the closing tag, how are people supposed to know whether the code is complete or not?.

Unless it is essential for the code to work, I agree (with many others) that this is an uneccessary shortcut which will lead to confusion and delivers no tangible benefit. I hope this is not the standard to be adopted by Xoops because it is unlikely to assist in debugging.

infinite line
Instead Transifex to recognize 900 lines as 900 strings for translations, recognize only 30 (newly added).

Mentioned Protector "problems"are only with Transifex, it's given as example, that such language files will be dropped.

CRLF issue with banned CMS in Administration/Preferences giving blank page looks like are not the same here, today will upload first VBox images for Mamba which gives blank page on userinfo.php.

OK, thx for explaining. I can see the benefit of having it work with Transifex.

It sounds like a Transifex problem. Did you file already a bug report with them? If not, I'll do it.

No, it doesn't. It is actually recommended not to use it.

See the [guidelines from Zend people](http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.php-file-formatting.html):

Quote:
> For files that contain only PHP code, the closing tag ("?>") is never permitted. It is not required by PHP, and omitting it´ prevents the accidental injection of trailing white space into the response.

I hope, in XOOPS 2.6.0 we'll have it implemented consistently.

Zend may feel happy to 'forbid' this for pure framework projects, but I think the PHP manual [optional end tag](http://docs.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.instruction-separation.php) comment is more suitable guidance for Xoops module development.

Most modules are modifications rather than ground-up solutions. If you encourage Zend's requirement, devs are going to cut and paste code and leave some with closing tags and some without. With no closing tag, any HTML in the file will break it, so people debugging a blank screen would have to read every line of code to check for some embedded HTML?.

Allowing whitespace after the closing tag is poor coding. To resolve this by removing the tag doesn't exactly encourage developers to be more diligent.

There is more that goes into this than was mentioned and ultimately I think it will depend on the preferences of the user. However since Zend is the group that is responsible for WRITING php it is a good idea to listen to what they say.

In the long run this is a coding practice and although to some programmers it will be like nails to a blackboard if you put them there it really doesn't do harm.

On large sites with lots of PHP files it can be a slight performance hit. It can introduce the hard to find "white" spaces as mentioned (And believe me, these can be hard to find...)

As to programmers in general. If someone is copying and pasting code from one module to another they should be looking at the code and not just running it. Chances are if they are copying a whole file this won't be an issue but if you are copying code into a template or something else with mixed HTML and PHP you better be watching your tags regardless.

So personally, if I am redoing a module or coding from scratch I will leave out the end tags because when you weigh the cons and pros really leaving it off makes sense.

But in the end, it really doesn't make that much of a difference.

What about if I want to upgrade from 2.5.0?

Should I just download the full package and replace all files and update system module?

That's the easiest way. Just make sure, you do NOT copy over the mainfile.php file!

Yes leave the mainfile.php in place.

Other than the notes below you will also want to keep your module directory in place as well.

One thing that the upgrade does not address is that you will want to disable your modules before doing an upgrade if you are coming from an older branch and once you have installed the new version enable them one at a time to make sure they are still compatible with your new version. If you get any white screens with all the modules off you need to look at the theme as it might have something in it that is not compatible with the newer xoops.

Also, realize that the new version of xoops generally comes with a new version of PM, Module and Protector so you will want to make especially sure you disable those modules if you are using them and make sure to remove those directories from the module directory before you copy over the new xoops version. If your old xoops also had a xoops trusted path you will likely have supporting code for Protector that will need to be removed and replaced with the new code in the trusted path.

Nope, It's look like "no rules" problem. Don't plan to bother Infidex with something that can be solved here. It's not only the LF issue, not only and white spaces, but and strange DEFINEs.

Does core files have problems - nope, then rest will follow this way of creating/maintaining language files until is not changed to POT/INI.

I hope to see .INI files in 2.6.0 and no more then 2 files per module.

Current LF ending makes them infinite (only for PHP DEFINE statement), this maybe is a transifex bug or not, but since there is a solution, why to bother someone else. If protector files was written in the way of how core files are written, who will ever mention them ? And from when someone on xoops.org follows Guidelines ? Half of the language files are still ending with "?>" (wont mention those on 3rd party modules)....

I agree that DEFINE in Protector is not the "typical" one, and we can look into it to see if we can change it on our side.

But LF is the standard in almost all Open Source projects that I am aware of, so this should be handled by Transifex.

Ok u report it as bug, to avoid double posts.
It happens with specific files only. So give Wishcraft My-Album download link as demonstration. They have to test it out on they're test server. To take a look in xoops/language/english/global.php and any of the old 4 files in myalbum/language/english/main, modinfo, admin, blocks.php.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
