Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory when they have been deleted. Specifically, a race condition occurs during the handling of the `onreadystatechange` event, causing a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when the browser attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to potential corruption.
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability leads to memory corruption. This corruption can be controlled by an attacker to achieve code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability when visited by the user using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into legitimate but compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or ads.
- **Email/Office Documents:** An attacker can embed a malicious ActiveX control within an application, Office document, or HTML email. If the user opens the document or email with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, the vulnerability could be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker must be able to host a specially crafted webpage or embed malicious code into an existing website or document.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious website, open a malicious document or email.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** Internet Explorer 6 and 7 are affected by this vulnerability. Internet Explorer 8 and 9 are not.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Server 2003, 2008, and 2008 R2 mitigates this vulnerability.
- **Workarounds:**
  - Setting Internet and Local Intranet security zones to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting.
  - Configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable it in the Internet and Local Intranet security zones.
