{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the \"User.interface\" parameter of GroupWise WebAccess. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize user-provided input which allows for directory traversal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially force WebAccess to return the contents of other files within the WebAccess directory structure, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
     "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious request with a specially crafted \"User.interface\" parameter, an attacker can exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable GroupWise WebAccess instance. No authentication is mentioned as required to exploit, so it might be exploitable without valid user credentials."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "Novell GroupWise 8 WebAccess",
    "GroupWise 8"
  ],
  "patch_information": "Apply GroupWise 8.0 Support Pack 3 (or later). GroupWise 2012 is not affected by this vulnerability.",
