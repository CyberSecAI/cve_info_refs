Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-0794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is that Moodle's cookie encryption was using a fixed key instead of a key generated during installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Encryption:** The vulnerability lies in the usage of a hardcoded, fixed key for encryption and decryption of cookies and potentially other values. This makes the encryption weak and predictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially decrypt cookies to gain sensitive information or manipulate them to gain unauthorized access. It's not explicitly stated what kind of information was stored in the encrypted values, but given that cookies are often used for authentication and session management, this represents a significant security risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who is able to intercept or obtain the encrypted cookie values. 
*   By knowing the fixed key, the attacker could decrypt any cookie data using the vulnerable encryption method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Cookie Data:** An attacker needs to obtain the encrypted cookie values, either by intercepting network traffic or other means (like compromised systems or logs).
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs technical expertise to decrypt cookies using the fixed key.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves generating a unique encryption key during installation.
*   The vulnerability was present in Moodle versions: 2.2, 2.1 to 2.1.3+, 2.0 to 2.0.6+, and 1.9 to 1.9.15+.
*   This was tracked by Moodle as "MSA-12-0005".
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Rajesh Taneja.
