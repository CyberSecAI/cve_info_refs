| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=783532#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-20 18:30:59 UTC  ``` A number of flaws have been fixed in new upstream Moodle 2.2.1 [1], 2.1.4 [2], 2.0.7 [3], and 1.9.16 [4] releases.  These do not have CVEs assigned (request pending), and since Fedora/EPEL will rebase to the latest versions of each branch, I'm summarizing them all here rather than creating a number of separate bugs.
