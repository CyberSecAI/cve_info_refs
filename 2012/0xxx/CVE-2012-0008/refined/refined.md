Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-0008

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from Visual Studio's insecure loading of add-ins from untrusted file locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Add-in Loading:** Visual Studio loads add-ins from locations that are not properly restricted or validated, allowing for the potential to load malicious add-ins.
*  **Elevation of Privilege:** By loading a specially crafted add-in, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running Visual Studio.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains elevated privileges, potentially system-level privileges.
*   **System Compromise:** This allows an attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Complete System Control:** The attacker can take complete control of an affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system.
*  **Malicious Add-in:** The attacker must place a specially crafted add-in in the path used by Visual Studio.
*  **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user, ideally one with higher privileges (such as an administrator), to start Visual Studio.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account on the target system.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to write files to a directory that Visual Studio will search for add-ins.
*   **Social Engineering (Indirect):** The attacker needs the target user to launch Visual Studio.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important".
*   The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
*   Microsoft was not aware of any instances of active exploitation at the time of the security bulletin's release.
*  Affected software includes Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SP1, Visual Studio 2010, and Visual Studio 2010 SP1.
* The fix involves correcting the manner in which Visual Studio restricts add-in loading.
* This vulnerability was privately reported.
