### IBM Personal Communications iSeries Access WorkStation 5.9 Profile

Disclosed
02/28/2012

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

The IBM Personal Communications I-Series application WorkStation is susceptible to a
stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability within file parsing in which data copied to a
location in memory exceeds the size of the reserved destination area. The buffer is located
on the runtime program stack.
When the WorkStation file is opened it will reach the code path at 0x67575180 located in
pcspref.dll which conducts string manipulation and validation on the data supplied in the
WorkStation file. The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends
a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length
of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character.
It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character.
The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function. The application has
declared a 52-element character array for the destination for strcpy function. The
function does not perform bounds checking therefore, data can be written paste the end of
the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local
variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the
saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer.
To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at
0x74 which is used as an argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as an id file
extension parameter. Once the caller regains control we will reach our RETURN. The Ret
instruction will be used to pop the overwritten saved return address which was corrupted.
This exploit has been written to bypass 2 mitigations DEP and ASLR on a Windows platform.
Versions tested:
IBM System i Access for Windows V6R1M0 version 06.01.0001.0000a
Which bundles pcsws.exe version 5090.27271.709
Tested on:
Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]
Microsoft Windows Vista [Version 6.0.6002]
Microsoft Windows 7 [Version 6.1.7600]

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/fileformat/ibm_pcm_ws
msf exploit(ibm_pcm_ws) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(ibm_pcm_ws) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(ibm_pcm_ws) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(ibm_pcm_ws) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

  *                      long "profile" description from the     *
  *                      WS file                                 *

  ****************************************************************
  While providing a very long description to the "profile"
  keyword of the WS file, memory overflow occurs with PCOMM.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  PCSPREF.DLL has been changed to use a specific API call to read
  only the number of bytes required to access the "profile" data
  from the session WS file.

  Fix scheduled for PCOM 5.9.8 Refresh Pack

			the buffer variable resulting in corruption of adjacent variables including other local
			variables, program state information and function arguments. You will notice that the
			saved RETURN address at offset 0x6c is overwritten by the data written past the buffer.

			To ensure we can perform arbitrary code execution we must we provide a valid pointer at
			0x74 which is used as a argument for the called function at 0x675751ED as a id file
			extension parameter. Once the caller regains control we will reach our RETURN. The Ret
			instruction will be used to pop the overwritten saved return address which was currupted.

			This exploit has been written to bypass 2 mitigations DEP and ASLR on a Windows platform.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
