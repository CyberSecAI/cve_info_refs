- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure default Apache configuration that maps the `/doc` URL to the `/usr/share/doc` directory, which may contain executable example scripts when certain scripting modules (e.g., mod_php, mod_rivet) are installed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of example scripts in `/usr/share/doc` which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS), code execution, or leakage of sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
    - Code execution
    - Leakage of sensitive data
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Accessing the `/doc` URL directly when the system is used for web browsing.
    - Accessing the `/doc` URL via a front-end server on the same host forwarding connections to an apache2 backend server on the localhost address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    - The attacker could be a local user if the machine is also used for web browsing.
    - The attacker could be an external user if there is a front-end server forwarding to the vulnerable Apache server.
