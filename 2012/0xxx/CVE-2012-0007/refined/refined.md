Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0007:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting (AntiXSS) Library incorrectly sanitizing specially crafted HTML. Specifically, it fails to properly evaluate certain characters after a CSS escaped character is detected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper sanitization of HTML input by the AntiXSS library.
- Failure to correctly handle CSS escaped characters, leading to bypass of XSS protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This enables the attacker to pass malicious scripts through the sanitization function and expose information that was not intended to be disclosed. The exact nature of the information disclosed depends on what the application handles.
- **Potential for further compromise:** Although the vulnerability does not directly allow code execution or privilege escalation, the disclosed information can potentially be used to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker crafts malicious HTML input which includes CSS escaped characters designed to bypass AntiXSS library's sanitization.
- The attacker sends this specially crafted HTML to a website that uses the vulnerable sanitization module of the AntiXSS Library.
- The AntiXSS library incorrectly sanitizes the input, allowing the malicious script to be executed in the context of the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send data to a web application utilizing the vulnerable AntiXSS library.
- The attacker needs the capability to craft a specific HTML payload including CSS escaped characters that can bypass the AntiXSS library.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in AntiXSS Library V3.x and V4.0.
- The update involves upgrading to AntiXSS Library version 4.2.1 which addresses the vulnerability.
- Sites that do not use the sanitization module of the AntiXSS Library are not affected.
- The vulnerability was privately reported.
- Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.
- A change in functionality was also included in the update. HTML input containing styles will now be stripped, but style tag contents will be left behind.
