Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-0384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Cisco IOS Software's command authorization mechanism when handling HTTP or HTTPS requests.
- Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the Cisco IOS software processes and authorizes commands received via the HTTP/HTTPS interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Authorization Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability for a remote, authenticated user to bypass the configured command authorization, potentially executing commands outside of their intended privilege level.
- This bypass is triggered by the processing of HTTP or HTTPS requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although the vulnerability does not allow unauthenticated access, an attacker with valid credentials can execute commands beyond their authorized level. This constitutes a privilege escalation.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker can potentially execute any Cisco IOS command that is configured for their authorization level, this can lead to complete system compromise if the commands available to the user are powerful.
- **Complete System compromise:** If the commands available to the user are powerful, then the device can be completely compromised by the attacker.
- **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability:** The attacker has the ability to gain access to confidential information, modify configurations or cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attack vector is remote and requires the HTTP or HTTPS server to be enabled on the vulnerable Cisco IOS device.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must possess valid credentials (username and password) to an account on the device, making this an authenticated attack vector.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco IOS device.
- **Valid Credentials:** The attacker must have a valid username and password that allows access to the device.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability to exploit it.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP/HTTPS requests to the target device

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco IOS Software releases after 12.2 if AAA authorization is in use and the device has an HTTP or HTTPS server configured.
- Cisco provides detailed steps to identify if a device is vulnerable by checking the HTTP/HTTPS server status and if AAA authorization is used.
- Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/HTTPS server or selectively disabling the WEB_EXEC service if other HTTP services are required. Access lists can also be used to restrict access to the HTTP server to trusted hosts.
- The advisory provides specific software fixes for different branches of Cisco IOS and IOS XE software.
- The vulnerability was reported by customers observing it during the normal operation of their devices and is tracked by Cisco Bug ID CSCtr91106.
