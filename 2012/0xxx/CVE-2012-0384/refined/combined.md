# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.4 |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This vulnerability requires that the HTTP or HTTPS server is enabled on the Cisco IOS device.      Products that are not running Cisco IOS Software are not vulnerable.      Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.       The HTTP server may be disabled as a workaround for the vulnerability described in this advisory.               This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120328-pai>    Note: The March 28, 2012, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes nine Cisco Security Advisories. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the March 2012 bundled publication.       Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semi-Annual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar12.html>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products   Any device running Cisco IOS Software release after 12.2 that has an HTTP or HTTPS server configured is affected by this vulnerability if AAA authorization is used.    To determine if an HTTP or HTTP server is configured with an HTTP or HTTPS server, issue the show ip http server status | include status command. The following example illustrates a Cisco IOS device with an HTTPS server enabled and the HTTP server disabled.      ```   Router> show ip http server status | include status    HTTP server status: Disabled    HTTP secure server status: Enabled      ```To determine if AAA authorization is used, an administrator can log in to the device and issue the **show run | include aaa authorization** command in privileged EXEC mode. If there is an entry that shows **aaa authorization commands**, as shown in the following example, then AAA authorization is configured.      ```   Router# show run | include aaa authorization commands    aaa authorization commands 0 default local group tacacs+    aaa authorization commands 1 default group tacacs+    aaa authorization commands 15 default local      ``` To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>.       Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable   If you are not running Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software, you are not affected by this vulnerability. Devices that are not using AAA authorization or that do not have an HTTP or HTTPS server configured are not affected by this vulnerability.       Cisco IOS XR is not affected by this vulnerability.         No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco IOS Software allows remote applications to administer and monitor devices running Cisco IOS Software over an HTTP or HTTPS connection.       A vulnerability exists that may allow the Cisco IOS command authorization to be bypassed, allowing a remote, authenticated HTTP or HTTPS session to execute any Cisco IOS command that is configured for their authorization level. This vulnerability does not allow unauthenticated access; a valid username and password are required to successfully exploit this vulnerability. Additionally, the vulnerability does not allow a user to execute commands that are not configured for their privilege level.      The HTTP server is enabled by default for cluster configurations and on the following Cisco switches: Catalyst 3700 series, Catalyst 3750 series, Catalyst 3550 series, Catalyst 3560 series, and Catalyst 2950 series.      More information on AAA authorization can be found at: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/secure/command/reference/sftauth.html>.      Releases of Cisco IOS Software after release 12.2 are potentially vulnerable. Please refer to the release table below for more information.               This vulnerability is documented as Cisco Bug ID [CSCtr91106](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr91106) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-0384.  Workarounds  * If the HTTP and HTTPS servers are not required, they may be disabled with the commands **no ip http server** and **no ip http secure-server**.      However, if web services are required, a feature was introduced in 12.3(14)T and later in which selective HTTP and HTTPS services could be enabled or disabled. The WEB\_EXEC service provides a facility to configure the device and retrieve the current state of the device from remote clients.      It is possible to disable the WEB\_EXEC service while still leaving other HTTP services active. If an installation does not require the use of the WEB\_EXEC service, then it may be disabled using the following procedure:   1. Verify the list of all session modules.            ```      Router# show ip http server session-module      HTTP server application session modules:      Session module Name  Handle Status   Secure-status  Description      HTTP_IFS              1      Active   Active         HTTP based IOS File Server      HOME_PAGE             2      Active   Active         IOS Homepage Server      QDM                   3      Active   Active         QOS Device Manager Server      QDM_SA                4      Active   Active         QOS Device Manager Signed Applet Server      WEB_EXEC              5      Active   Active         HTTP based IOS EXEC Server      IXI                   6      Active   Active         IOS XML Infra Application Server      IDCONF                7      Active   Active         IDCONF HTTP(S) Server      XSM                   8      Active   Active         XML Session Manager      VDM                   9      Active   Active         VPN Device Manager Server      XML_Api               10     Active   Active         XML Api      ITS                   11     Active   Active         IOS Telephony Service      ITS_LOCDIR            12     Active   Active         ITS Local Directory Search      CME_SERVICE_URL       13     Active   Active         CME Service URL      CME_AUTH_SRV_LOGIN    14     Active   Active         CME Authentication Server      IPS_SDEE              15     Active   Active         IOS IPS SDEE Server      tti-petitioner        16     Active   Active         TTI Petitioner      ```   2. Create a list of session modules that are required, in this example it would be everything other than WEB\_EXEC.            ```      Router# configuration terminal      Router(config)# ip http session-module-list exclude_webexec             HTTP_IFS,HOME_PAGE,QDM,QDM_SA,IXI,IDCONF,XSM,VDM,XML_Api,      ITS,ITS_LOCDIR,CME_SERVICE_URL,CME_AUTH_SRV_LOGIN,IPS_SDEE,tti-petitioner      ```   3. Selectively enable HTTP/HTTPS applications that will service incoming HTTP requests from remote clients.            ```      Router(config)# ip http active-session-modules exclude_webexec      Router(config)# ip http secure-active-session-modules exclude_webexec      Router(config)# exit      ```   4. Verify the list of all session modules, and ensure WEB\_EXEC is not active.            ```      Router# show ip http server session-module       HTTP server application session modules:       Session module Name  Handle Status   Secure-status  Description       HTTP_IFS              1      Active   Active         HTTP based IOS File Server       HOME_PAGE             2      Active   Active         IOS Homepage Server       QDM                   3      Active   Active         QOS Device Manager Server       QDM_SA                4      Active   Active         QOS Device Manager Signed Applet Server       WEB_EXEC              5      Inactive Inactive       HTTP based IOS EXEC Server       IXI                   6      Active   Active         IOS XML Infra Application Server       IDCONF                7      Active   Active         IDCONF HTTP(S) Server       XSM                   8      Active   Active         XML Session Manager       VDM                   9      Active   Active         VPN Device Manager Server       XML_Api               10     Active   Active         XML Api       ITS                   11     Active   Active         IOS Telephony Service       ITS_LOCDIR            12     Active   Active         ITS Local Directory Search       CME_SERVICE_URL       13     Active   Active         CME Service URL       CME_AUTH_SRV_LOGIN    14     Active   Active         CME Authentication Server       IPS_SDEE              15     Active   Active         IOS IPS SDEE Server       tti-petitioner        16     Active   Active         TTI Petitioner             ```For further information on the selective enabling of applications using an HTTP or secure HTTP server, consult the Cisco IOS network management configuration guide, release 12.4T, at: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/netmgmt/configuration/guide/nm_http_app_enable.html>      If the HTTP server and WEB\_EXEC service are required, it is a recommended best practice to limit which hosts may access the HTTP server to allow only trusted sources. An access list can be applied to the HTTP server to limit which hosts are permitted access. To apply an access list to the HTTP server, use the following command in global configuration mode: **ip http access-class {access-list-number | access-list-name}**.      The following example shows an access list that allows only trusted hosts to access the Cisco IOS HTTP server:      ```   ip access-list standard 20        permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255        remark "Above is a trusted subnet"        remark "Add further trusted subnets or hosts below"       ! (Note: all other access implicitly denied) ! (Apply the access-list to the http server)        ip http access-class 20   ```For additional information on configuring the Cisco IOS HTTP server, consult [Using the Cisco Web Browser User Interface.](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/fundamentals/configuration/guide/web_based_cfg_ps6350_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html)  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
