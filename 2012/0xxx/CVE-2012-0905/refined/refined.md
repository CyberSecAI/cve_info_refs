Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-0905

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an SQL injection flaw in the "gamebase" addon for deV!L`z Clanportal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `gameid` parameter within the `gamebase/?action=detail` URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability can lead to the attacker gaining access to sensitive database information, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might also be able to modify or delete data within the database.
- **Complete System Takeover**: Depending on the database permissions of the web application, the attacker might be able to compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable `gameid` parameter, typically using a web browser.
- The specific vulnerable URL parameter is: `gamebase/?action=detail&gameid=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable deV!L`z Clanportal installation.
- **Basic Understanding of SQLi:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- **No Authentication Required**: The exploit can be triggered without prior authentication.

**Technical Details**
The provided exploit example demonstrates how to extract user credentials from the `dzcp_users` table by injecting a `UNION SELECT` statement into the `gameid` parameter:
`http://[host]/[path]/gamebase/?action=detail&gameid=1+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,nick,pwd,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22+from+dzcp_users+where+id=1--+`
