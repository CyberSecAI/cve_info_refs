{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A memory safety problem in the nsWindow component for Android.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The nsWindow component for Android does not check if the instance is being destroyed after dispatching an event. This can lead to a use-after-free condition."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, or application crashes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered when an event is dispatched in the nsWindow component, potentially caused by user interaction or a malicious website.",
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to trigger events that involve the nsWindow component. This could be accomplished via crafted web content or by manipulating the user interface."
  },
  "additional_details": "This vulnerability was found in Mobile Firefox 10 by Masayuki Nakano. The fix involves adding a check to the nsWindow component to ensure it is not destroyed after dispatching events. The fix also makes sure `nsBaseWidget::OnDestroy()` is being called during the destruction of the object. This issue is similar to a previously discovered bug (402505) on Mac, though the test cases for that did not trigger a crash on Android. The fix was applied to Firefox 11, ESR 10.0.3, and mobile Firefox builds."
