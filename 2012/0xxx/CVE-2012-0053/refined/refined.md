1.  Based on the official CVE description:
    "The Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script."

2.  Analysis of the provided content:

    -   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Apache HTTP Server improperly includes the full HTTP header line in the default 400 error response, instead of filtering out the cookie values.

    -   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
        -   Exposure of `HttpOnly` cookies in default error pages.
        -   Improper handling of header information in 400 error responses.
        -   The vulnerability can be exploited when a custom `ErrorDocument` is not defined for status code 400.
    
    -   **Impact of exploitation**:
        -   Unauthorized access to data (specifically `HttpOnly` cookies).
        -   Potentially gain access to session information.
        -   The issue is exploitable using cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
     
    -   **Attack vectors**:
        -   Sending a long or malformed HTTP header.
        -   Exploiting a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a web application to send crafted HTTP headers.
    
    -   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
        -   Ability to send arbitrary HTTP requests to the server.
        -   For XSS exploitation, the attacker needs to be able to inject javascript on a vulnerable web page.
        -   No specific authentication needed to exploit if combined with XSS.

3.  Additional details:
    - The vulnerability was addressed by limiting the amount of header information included in the default 400 error page, only including the header name, or an 80-character prefix of the name if the name exceeds 80 chars.
    - The issue affects Apache versions from 2.2.0 up to and including 2.2.21
    - The vulnerability can be mitigated by defining custom error document for 400 errors.
    - Some content also mentions that the vulnerability can be leveraged on a remote server without the need for authentication.
