| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=791000#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-15 22:06:55 UTC  ``` It was discovered that mumble created its database file (~/.local/share/data/Mumble/.mumble.sqlite) with insecure world-readable permissions.  If the user had (non-default) permissions on their home directory, another local user could obtain password and configuration settings from the database file [1].  This has been corrected in upstream git [2] and is reported as affecting 1.2.3 and earlier.  [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mumble/+bug/783405](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mumble/%2Bbug/783405) [2] <https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/commit/5632c35d6759f5e13a7dfe78e4ee6403ff6a8e3e>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=791000#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-16 01:55:40 UTC  ``` This has been assigned CVE-2012-0863:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q1/433>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=791000#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-16 01:56:35 UTC  ``` Created mumble tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 791058](show_bug.cgi?id=791058 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-0863 mumble: insecure world-readable permissions on database file [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=791000#c3)  Fedora Update System    2012-06-19 15:00:48 UTC  ``` mumble-1.2.3-5.fc16.1 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

Package        : mumble
Vulnerability  : information disclosure
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0863
Debian Bug     : 659039

It was discovered that mumble, a VoIP client, does not probably manage
permission on its user-specific configuration files, allowing other
local users on the system to access them.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-6+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.3-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your mumble packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

It looks like the version in squeeze is also affected by this.  It
should probably be fixed in a proposed-update if not as a security
fix.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <20120215220912.GR15310@redhat.com>
Date: Wed, 15 Feb 2012 15:09:12 -0700
From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request: mumble local information disclosure

It was discovered that mumble created its database file
(~/.local/share/data/Mumble/.mumble.sqlite) with insecure world-readable
permissions.  If the user had (non-default) permissions on their home
directory, another local user could obtain password and configuration
settings from the database file.

This has been corrected in upstream git and is reported as affecting
1.2.3 and earlier.

Could a CVE be assigned to this flaw?

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!
