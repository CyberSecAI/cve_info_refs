Subject: openssh-server: Forced Command handling leaks private
information to ssh
 clients
Date: Thu, 26 Jan 2012 11:46:18 +0100

Package: openssh-server
Version: 1:5.5p1-6+squeeze1
Severity: normal

The handling of multiple forced commands in ~/.ssh/authorized key leaks
information about other configured forced commands to the user. This
affects tools lile gitolite, which makes heavy use of forced commands
(For gitolite, this bug means: A user can obtain some or all usernames
 with access to the same gitolite setup by just using the verbose
 switch of his ssh client, which is a really nasty thing).

Example:

 User "bbu" on machine "ptx" has three configured forced commands for
 keys test{1,2,3}_rsa.pub:

 command="/usr/bin/first_command" ssh-rsa [...third_key...]
 command="/usr/bin/second_command" ssh-rsa [...second_key...]
 command="/usr/bin/third_command" ssh-rsa [...third_key...]

 Now, if the user of test1_rsa.pub uses the "-v" switch of
 his ssh client, he gets just his command:

 foo@bar:~/ssh_debug$ ssh -i test1_rsa -v bbu@ptx 2>&1 | grep Forced\
command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/first_command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/first_command

 but the user of test2_rsa.pub sees two commands:

 foo@bar:~/ssh_debug$ ssh -i test2_rsa -v bbu@ptx 2>&1 | grep Forced\
command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/first_command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/second_command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/first_command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/second_command

 and for user of test3_rsa.pub:

 bbu@...ra:~/ssh_debug$ ssh -i test3_rsa -v bbu@ptx 2>&1 | grep Forced\
command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/first_command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/second_command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/third_command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/first_command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/second_command
 debug1: Remote: Forced command: /usr/bin/third_command
======================================================================

I have confirmed that this works exactly as advertised on Debian 6. I
have confirmed that RHEL/Fedora are not affected (you only get shown the
command for your specific SSH key).

So Debian is definitely affected, but I am concerned others may be as
well (is this Debian specific or does it affect all users of that
version of OpenSSH?). I suggest you test this on your own distributions
as well.

Colin, can you fix this for the 6.0.5 point release?

Yes - sorry for the delay, real life intervened fairly heavily.  Do the
signed packages at master:~cjwatson/openssh/ meet your requirements?  A
debdiff follows.

The patch looks good, but the targeted distribution should be 'stable',
not 'stable-security', as the intention was to fix this through a stable
point update.

Cheers,

The fix needs to be acked by the stable release managers, adding them to CC.

Hmmm, it would be nicer if it were still possible to log commands that
the key /should/ be permitted to access, but I'm guessing that would be
a more involved and invasive change.

Based on the debdiff in
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=657445#29> , please go
ahead (with the distribution set to "stable" or "squeeze").

Regards,

Adam

I misunderstood.  Sorry about that.

This isn't an access list; it's a forced command, overriding whatever
the client tries to do.  If authentication succeeds and it gets as far
as executing the command, then that's already logged at -d in the
server; see session.c:do_exec.

# CVE-2012-0814

| **Name** | CVE-2012-0814 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The auth\_parse\_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized\_keys command options, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user account required by Gitolite. NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized\_keys file in its own home directory. |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

By the way, is the ForceCommand (and other directives) really supposed
to be private for different keys (or, more widely, for different matches
for the same user).
