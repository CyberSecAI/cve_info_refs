Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how OpenSSH's `sshd` handles forced commands specified in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. Specifically, when multiple forced commands are configured for different keys belonging to the same user, the debug output (when the `-v` flag is used with the ssh client) reveals *all* forced commands configured for that user, instead of only the command associated with the specific key used for authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The primary weakness is the disclosure of configured forced commands in debug output.
*   **Cross-Privilege Boundary Violation (Potentially):** As the CVE description notes, a user account might be intentionally restricted with no shell or filesystem access. Thus, they would not normally be able to view the contents of `authorized_keys`, but this vulnerability bypasses that restriction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** An attacker can potentially learn about the commands intended to be executed for other keys associated with the same user, as well as the other usernames with access to the same setup.
*   **Compromise of System Security:** This information can be used to infer user access, system setup, and command restrictions. This information can be used in further attacks, such as a supply chain attack against a git repository.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SSH Client Verbose Output (-v flag):** The vulnerability is triggered by using the verbose output option of an SSH client during authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a valid user who has an SSH key configured in the `authorized_keys` file on the target system.
*   **Ability to Connect via SSH:** The attacker must be able to connect to the target server using SSH.
*   **Knowledge of `-v` flag:** The attacker needs to use the `-v` (verbose) flag when connecting via SSH, to trigger the output that contains the leaked information

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in OpenSSH versions prior to 5.7.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Bjoern Buerger and reported to Debian.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2012-0814 by Kurt Seifried, and was fixed in Debian by patch provided by Marc Deslauriers.
*   The fix involves removing the actual command from the debug message and simply indicating that a forced command was used.
