Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0943:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an insecure cleanup script used in the Light Display Manager (lightdm) and gdm-guest-session packages for guest sessions. The script used the `find` command to locate temporary files owned by the guest user in `/tmp` and then piped the results to `xargs rm -rf`. The vulnerability exists because the `find` command could return filenames with spaces, which would then cause `xargs` to interpret the spaces as delimiters between different files to delete. An attacker could exploit this behavior to delete files belonging to other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure use of `find` and `xargs`:** The script did not properly handle filenames containing spaces or other special characters. When `find` outputs filenames to `xargs` separated by spaces, `xargs` misinterprets filenames with spaces, thus allowing for files outside the intended target to be deleted. This is a classic example of how incorrect handling of whitespace in shell commands can lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Privileged File Deletion:** The cleanup script was executed with the privileges of the last logged in user which if the user is logged as the admin could lead to escalated file deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A local attacker could delete arbitrary files on the system by creating files in `/tmp` with specific names that, when processed by the vulnerable cleanup script, would result in the deletion of other files. The files would be deleted with the privileges of the last logged-in user which could be root if a user with admin privileges was the last to log-in.
- **Denial of Service:** By deleting critical system files, an attacker could render the system unusable, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system with the ability to create files in the `/tmp` directory. The attacker also needs knowledge of how the cleanup script handles filenames with spaces to craft an exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a user account on the target system, allowing them to log in and create files in `/tmp`.
- **Knowledge of Script Behavior:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable cleanup script and how it handles filenames with spaces.
- **Ability to Trigger Cleanup:** The attacker would likely need to log in to a guest session to trigger the execution of the cleanup script.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in both `lightdm` and `gdm-guest-session`.
- The fix involves using `find ... -print0` and `xargs -0` to correctly handle filenames containing spaces. The `-print0` action ensures that filenames are null-terminated, and the `-0` option tells `xargs` to expect null-terminated input, preventing issues with spaces in filenames.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Ubuntu releases:
    - Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric): Fixed in `lightdm` version `1.0.6-0ubuntu1.6`.
    - Earlier Ubuntu versions are also affected via `gdm-guest-session`.
