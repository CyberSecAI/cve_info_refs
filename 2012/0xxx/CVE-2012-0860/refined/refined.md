```
{
  "CVE-2012-0860": {
    "Root cause": "The vds_installer.py script, used to install new hosts in RHEV, is copied to /tmp and executes from there. The script imports modules, and because /tmp is in the module search path, an attacker can create malicious modules in /tmp that will be executed with root privileges.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of /tmp directory",
      "Uncontrolled module import path"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local, unprivileged user on the host to be installed/added to RHEV-M could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to the host being installed"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local, unprivileged access on the target host."
  }
}
