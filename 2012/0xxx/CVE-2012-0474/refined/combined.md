How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86\_64; rv:10.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.2
Build ID: 20120215223356
Steps to reproduce:
Use javascript to open new window of location on same domain.
On new window, history.pushState change to same or other location on same domain.
Change location of window to foreign website.
History.back.
History.forward.
History.back.
Actual results:
Foreign website is loaded with my url.
Also, the javascript on that page then sends requests to my domain. Private information can be obtained from these requests.
Expected results:
Loading of a different domain should cancel the history change.

I have tested this on: Firefox 10.0.2 on linux and Firefox 11 on Windows 7
I've also made a test site to view the active code. Further requests on maps.google.com do not go to google but go to my domain: badcoding.net

I've added another example in which it retains the SSL identifier of wikipedia.org.
If you switch tabs after this and return later, the name on the SSL identifier changes from wikipedia.org to badcoding.net while still displaying the SSL information from wikipedia.org
When viewing the dropdown of the SSL identifier, it shows:
You are connected to:
badcoding.net
on "More Information", the website is badcoding.net
on "View Certificate", it is wikipedia.org's certificate.

We really think it's at the new URL, too. I get
Security Error: Content at <http://badcoding.net/> may not load data from <https://maps.google.com/>.

[Testcase with hash navigation instead of pushstate (must be run locally)](attachment.cgi?id=607744)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=607744&action=edit)

This happens if we substitute a hash navigation for the pushstate.

Somehow we're doing a short-circuited load from maps.google.com to the attack page on the final <back>. A short-circuited load is only supposed to happen between SHEntries which represent the same document (via pushstate or a hash navigation), so this is extremely wrong.

I was able to leverage this bug as a XSS on maps.google.com through a requested javascript file.

So I think what's going wrong here is:
We call nsSHistory::AddEntry off nsDocShell::CreateContentViewer, which happens as a result of nsHttpChannel::OnStartRequest. So the SHEntry for google maps is, in normal operation, created asynchronously after we navigate the window.
I don't have a complete understanding of what's going on here, because it disappears when I look at it in a debugger, but I have the initial sequence down:
1) We set up two shentries which share a document (via pushstate or a hash navigation, doesn't seem to matter). Call these SHEntries A and B.
2) We start loading maps.google.com.
3) Before we call nsSHistory::AddEntry for maps.google.com, we go back. Now we're at index 0, corresponding to SHEntry A.
Now the details are a bit hazier, but what I guess happens is
4) We go forward. Now we're at index 1, SHEntry B. This navigation is correctly a short-circuited load.
5) maps.google.com loads into the current docshell SHEntry, B rather than calling nsSHistory::AddEntry and creating a brand new SHEntry for itself.
The final go(-1) in the test is unnecessary.
The real question is, why is (5) happening?

> The real question is, why is (5) happening?
Oh, because mLoadType after step (4) is 0x4, LOAD\_CMD\_HISTORY.
So the back->forward clobbers our memory of the type of the outstanding load.
I'm not sure what's the right solution here, but one thing we could do is cancel outstanding asynchronous loads when we do a short-circuit load. That would match what we do when you do two asynchronous loads in a row (we cancel the first one).

Hmm. <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/history.html#navigate> says that a preexisting navigation that's not far enough along should be canceled on attempts to navigate at step 6. The short-circuiting of a load should happen at step 7.
So we should be canceling the outstanding load when the scroll request is made, yes, if it's early enough in the load. In fact we should be canceling it when the back() call happens, I think. I'd have to recheck when the back() call enters the "navigate" steps. I believe that would in fact fix this bug.

Patch v1
See, this is no good. With this patch, clicking on an anchor to scroll down a page while that page is loading will stop the loading of the page.
That's why the Stop() call is after the short-circuit code right now and why we want to only cancel navigations that are not "far enough" along... :(

Oh, goodness...
What if we call Stop() in the short-circuit code if the short-circuit URI doesn't match-except-hash mLoadingURI?

|  | |

The mLoadingURI thing would fail for pushState, no?
How about we grovel through the loadgroup looking for requests with the LOAD\_DOCUMENT\_URI flag and if those do not match the channel of the document currently in the docshell, cancel just those requests?

I thought I'd put my money where my mouth is wrt risk and push to m-i without first pushing to try. That was perhaps ill-advised.
This patch turns the scriptaculous suite permaorange. I imagine scriptaculous is doing something dumb, but this does suggest that sites may be affected by this change.

Scriptaculous simulates a mouse click on an anchor reference and then, without
ever spinning the event loop, eventually goes on to the next test in the line
modified here.
The click is handled asynchronously, so it happens after we do |testIframe.src
= nextTest|, so the anchor load triggered by the click cancels the nextTest
load.

"If there is a preexisting attempt to navigate the browsing context, and either that attempt has not yet matured (i.e. it has not passed the point of making its Document the active document), or that navigation's resource is not to be fetched using HTTP GET or equivalent, or its resource's absolute URL differs from this attempt's by more than the presence, absence, or value of the <fragment> component, then cancel that preexisting attempt to navigate the browsing context."
So this implies that a fragment navigation cancels any other loads.
Presumably the link's onclick handler gets called before we run the navigation algorithm (because the onclick handler needs to be able to cancel the click event) -- in that case, it sounds to me that we're basically following the spec here. So we may need to fix the spec, too. :(

Oh...he's saying to cancel the load only if the URLs differ by \*more\* than the fragment. So this should not cancel the load.

So in the face of
<a href="#foo" onclick="window.location='<http://google.com>'">
as I understand the spec, we're supposed to run onclick followed by #foo.
If that's the case, making the click synchronous, as we discussed earlier today, isn't going to help.

Just to follow up, [comment 35](/show_bug.cgi?id=737307#c35 "VERIFIED FIXED - universal XSS by confusing docshell with short-circuited loads") was correct, and that was a spec bug. Ian will be fixing that, but we need a different fix for this bug.

Could we not change load types on short-circuited loads? Or is mLoadType looked at after load completion by someone?

I'm sure we could do this to solve this bug. But I'm not sure we could do this without introducing any new bugs. mLoadType is read in a bunch of places, e.g. AddToSessionHistory.
Now, maybe we could change the load type at the beginning of the short-circuited load and then change it back at the end of the load...

Apparently so.
The web-facing change in the latest patch is much more tightly-scoped, so it's (hopefully) much less likely to break sites.

Patch v3
This patch should be much less web-visible than the previous one. (I didn't have to make any changes to the test suite to get it to pass, for example.)
Still risky, as always.

Can someone please clarify the expected result?
I downloaded a local copy of the testcase and opened it in Firefox.
RESULT:
1. Open file:///home/mozilla/Downloads/pushstate-sec.html and click "Click Here"
2. Opens a new tab and redirects to maps.google.com
3. Redirects back to file:///home/mozilla/Downloads/pushstate-sec.html#foo

Yes, that's right.
What would be wrong is if it opened maps.google.com but displayed pushstate-sec.html as the URL.
Please try all the relevant testcases, both in this bug and in [bug 687745](/show_bug.cgi?id=687745 "VERIFIED FIXED - (CVE-2012-0474) URL & SSL/TLS Spoofing and saved password stealing using multiple history.back() and history.forward()").

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2
Build ID: 20110902133214
Steps to reproduce:
The problem originated is from the creation of a link with javascript (window.open ; document.location ; back() ; forward() ; fragment navigation and Redirect.) . When you open a new tab via window.open on another address (with SSL or not) and use all of this elements, it's possible to spoof the URL and SSL/TLS.
It's also possible to steal saved password on Mozilla firefox if the web page spoofed contains a form with saved password. the form should be like : <form ACTION="/connect.php"> but not like this : <form ACTION="[HTTP://www.xxx.yyy/connect.php](http://www.xxx.yyy/connect.php)"> for steal the saved password and login (I have chosen linkedin.com for demonstrate this).
This blank page can be changed with javascript with making a spoofing attak.
Actual results:
URL with SSL/TLS is Spoofed and we can steal saved password of linkedin.com (and many other website with a connection formulary's like linkedin.com)
/!\ I had found a very similare vulnerability on Google chrome in the past (same impact => SecSeverity:high)

I had to run the testcase several times, but it does reproduce for me in Firefox 6 and Nightly. Just to make clear what Jordi is reporting:
When using window.open and some APIs to navigate the opened document, it is possible to navigate the opened document to a different site, while the location bar doesn't stay in sync with the new location. In cases where the navigated document winds up on a login form with a relative <form action>, an attacker could steal the submitted form data because it would be presumably sent to the relative location on the attacker's domain.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueWhiteboard: [sg:high]

Neither Brandon nor I have been able to reproduce this "seemlessly", though a couple of times (out of many, many, more failed attempts) I did get the PoC to work by hitting the forward (not back!) button once I was on the LinkedIn page. At that point the URL changed to www.alternativ-testing.fr but the "Larry" button continued to say LinkedIn (slight difference from the movie). The LinkedIn content was not deleted (including the replayed saved password) and clicking submit did send the password to Jordi's site as shown in the movie.
On the times I've gotten to almost the right state (LinkedIn showing, password replayed, forward button but not back enabled) I can go back to the original window and manually do "a.history.forward()" to bring about the spoof so maybe it's just a timing issue that could be easily solved.
This report is more of a constellation of issues rather than a simple singular bug.
As a "spoof" it's about on par with your typical phishing page (URL bar has the wrong domain), but the fact that Firefox has replayed the password could be convincing.
Although the form submit relative URL goes to the wrong domain, apparently internally we still think we're on LinkedIn because I cannot access any properties of the document through the window handle held by the original page.
1) Is the bug that the content (or bfcache?) and URL history got out of sync, or that we didn't clear the content when we navigated to www.alternativ-testing.fr? Or that we changed the URL without really navigating at all?
2) There's a Larry-spoofing problem in that we take the current-page's URL rather than a URL from the certificate, leading to showing the remembered secure state (blue larry) with an HTTP insecure domain.
3) If we think the content is from LinkedIn why is the form submitting somewhere else? Are other relative URLs also incorrectly calculated in this state (say some AJAX-y script) or is this problem restricted to <form>s?
4) This is another case where auto-replaying of passwords before there's any indication of intent to use the form gets us into trouble.

or one vulnerability with multiple effect!
a simpler and better testcase is possible ! but on my firefox , testcase2.0 works perfectly or half the time!

I have not yet tried testcase2.0, my comments were based on the initial testcase and the one hosted on your site.

I have no idea about #1 and #3 from [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=687745#c21 "VERIFIED FIXED - (CVE-2012-0474) URL & SSL/TLS Spoofing and saved password stealing using multiple history.back() and history.forward()"). That just should not be happening. Even if the url bar is confused, relative URLs for something like forms should be resolved wrt the document base URI...
Justin, Olli?

Just FYI, I've managed to reproduce the problem twice using testcase2.0.
I didn't really debug this yet, but it looked like the linkedin page got different documentURI, which
is why some relative urls in the page didn't link to linkedin.

You can see than the saved password and login of developer.mozilla.org are sent to attacker page . this time i've don't coded a PHP stealer of the password sent because it requiere a .htaccess but i already use a different htaccess on my website base.

All right, Jordi. From our point of view, the order isn't important and we don't specifically put one name before another as a way of indicating which bug reporter is more important.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-27

## Page load short-circuit can lead to XSS

Announced
April 24, 2012
Reporter
Jordi Chancel, Eddy Bordi, Chris McGowen
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 12
* Firefox ESR 10.0.4
* SeaMonkey 2.9
* Thunderbird 12
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.4

### Description

Security researchers **Jordi Chancel** and **Eddy
Bordi** reported that they could short-circuit page loads to show the
address of a different site than what is loaded in the window in the addressbar.
Security researcher **Chris McGowen** independently reported the
same flaw, and further demonstrated that this could lead to loading scripts from
the attacker's site, leaving users vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
