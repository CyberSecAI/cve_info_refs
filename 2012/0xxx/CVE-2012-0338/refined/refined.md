    "Root cause": "The content discusses a problem with VTY ACLs in Cisco IOS 15, which requires the `vrf-also` parameter for per-VRF ACL configuration, and is not a vulnerability. It references a bug report (CSCsv86113), but this is a different issue than the one specified in the CVE.",
     "Weaknesses": "There are no vulnerabilities related to this CVE in this content.",
     "Impact": "No impact related to the specified vulnerability.",
     "Attack vectors": "No attack vectors related to the specified vulnerability.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No attacker capabilities/position required for exploitation of this vulnerability."

    "CVE ID": "CVE-2012-0338",
    "Content": "RELATED",
    "Original content": "Content from www.cisco.com_5cef54b2_20250125_121718.html",
    "Root cause": "The document contains a resolved vulnerability described in CSCsv86113, which is also mentioned in the forum content. This is related to an issue where SSH on a VRF interface was allowed irrespective of the 'vrf-also' keyword, which is a security related flaw.",
    "Weaknesses": "The vulnerability is a security flaw related to allowing SSH access on a VRF interface without the correct access control configuration (`vrf-also`).",
    "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is that unauthorized users could potentially gain access to the device through SSH, bypassing the intended access restrictions enforced by VRFs. An attacker on a non-permitted VRF could gain access.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves attempting to establish SSH connections from a non-permitted VRF interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to initiate an SSH connection to the vulnerable Cisco IOS device on a non-permitted VRF."
