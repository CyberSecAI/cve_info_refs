  "CVE-2012-0452": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2012-0452",
      "Description": "Mozilla developers Andrew McCreight and Olli Pettay found that ReadPrototypeBindings will leave a XBL binding in a hash table even when the function fails. If this occurs, when the cycle collector reads this hash table and attempts to do a virtual method on this binding a crash will occur. This crash may be potentially exploitable.",
        "Source": "Multiple sources"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Improper error handling in `nsXBLDocumentInfo::ReadPrototypeBindings` function, which can leave a dangling pointer to an XBL binding in a hash table if `nsXBLPrototypeBinding::Read` fails.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability due to a dangling pointer",
          "Improper cleanup after failure"
      ],
      "Impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability that could lead to application crash and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack Vectors": "Triggering a failure within the `nsXBLPrototypeBinding::Read` function during the loading of XBL bindings. It's suggested that certain addons can make this vulnerability more easily triggered.",
        "Required Capabilities": "Attacker would need to load a crafted or malformed XBL binding, either by creating a malicious website or exploiting a vulnerability through an add-on."
    },
        "Affected Products":[
            "Mozilla Firefox 10 and earlier",
            "Firefox ESR 10.0.1",
            "SeaMonkey 2.7.1",
            "Thunderbird 10.0.1",
            "Thunderbird ESR 10.0.1",
             "openSUSE 11.4",
              "Ubuntu 10.04",
              "Ubuntu 10.10",
              "Ubuntu 11.04",
             "Ubuntu 11.10",
             "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 for VMware",
            "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 FOR SP2",
            "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1",
            "SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP1 FOR SP2",
            "SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP1"
        ],
    "Additional Notes": "The vulnerability is present due to the new XBL cache implementation in Firefox 10. The fix involves ensuring the XBL binding is properly removed from the hash table if `nsXBLPrototypeBinding::Read` fails."
