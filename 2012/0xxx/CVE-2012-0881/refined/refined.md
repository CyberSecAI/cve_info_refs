Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0881:

**CVE Description:**

*   **CVE-2012-0881** is a vulnerability affecting Apache Xerces2 Java. It involves hash table collisions leading to excessive CPU consumption.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a flaw in the hash table implementation within the Xerces-J2 XML parser. This flaw allows for specially crafted XML messages to cause hash collisions, which result in increased processing time and CPU usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hash Table Collisions:** The primary weakness lies in the hash table implementation. It is susceptible to collisions when specific input patterns are provided.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CPU Consumption:** Successful exploitation leads to excessive CPU consumption on the server or system processing the crafted XML document.
*   **Denial of Service:** The high CPU usage can make the system unresponsive and unavailable for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted XML Messages:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted XML messages to a vulnerable XML service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send the malicious XML message to the targeted service.
*   **XML Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to create XML messages that will trigger the hash collisions within Xerces-J2's implementation.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is related to a broader class of hash table collision attacks (oCERT-2011-003) that affect different XML parsers
*   The bug report in Red Hat Bugzilla indicates that the issue was rated as having "Moderate" security impact.
*   The affected versions of Xerces-J2 were those shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
*   A fix was introduced in Xerces-J 2.12.0.
*   The attack can be applied to different XML nodes like entities, attributes, namespaces, etc.
