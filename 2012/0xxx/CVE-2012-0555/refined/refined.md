Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2012-0555:

**CVE-2012-0555**

*   **Component:** Oracle Outside In Technology
*   **Subcomponent:** Outside In Image Export SDK
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**  The document implies a vulnerability within the Outside In Image Export SDK. The nature of the vulnerability is not fully disclosed but it likely involves a flaw in how the SDK processes image files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** A vulnerability within the Outside In Image Export SDK that could be exploited remotely without authentication. Specifics of the weakness are not detailed
*  **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to partial compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability. (Partial+ impact level)
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks that leverage the vulnerable Outside In Image Export SDK. The document assumes the hosting software exposes this functionality over the network without authentication
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs network access to a system using the vulnerable Oracle Outside In Technology and needs to be able to trigger the flawed image processing functionality. No authentication is required.

**Affected Versions:**

*   8.3.5
*   8.3.7

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document mentions that Outside In Technology is a suite of SDKs and doesn't have an associated protocol, but the CVSS score is calculated under the assumption that the software exposes the vulnerable SDK functionality over the network without authentication. The actual CVSS score could be lower if this assumption is incorrect.
*   This vulnerability is part of a group of similar vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-0554, CVE-2012-0556, CVE-2012-0557) affecting the same component.
