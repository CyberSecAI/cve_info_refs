Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-0502:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The root cause lies in the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) `KeyboardFocusManager` class within the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). There is a flaw in how the `KeyboardFocusManager` manages focus, which can allow an untrusted Java applet to steal focus.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Improper focus management in AWT `KeyboardFocusManager`.
* Vulnerability is triggered through untrusted Java applets or web start applications.
* Insufficient input validation is likely the cause, where code does not prevent malicious applets from obtaining focus, allowing the potential for capturing sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized Access/Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain control over the keyboard focus and potentially steal sensitive information from the user, including typed data like passwords or other personal data.
*  **System Compromise:** As mentioned in the Red Hat advisory document, the vulnerability has a "Critical Impact" as it can lead to "system compromise (arbitrary code execution)". Though no details are available on how this is achieved via the AWT flaw, this suggests a privilege escalation path is possible. 
*  **Partial Availability Impact:** Some advisories mention partial availability impact, usually in a client environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation**: The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over a network without authentication, by sending a crafted request to a vulnerable application.
*   **Untrusted Java applets/Web Start applications:** The attack vector involves running malicious applets or Web Start applications from untrusted sources.
*  **Sound Component (CVE-2011-3563)**:  Exploitation through Java Sound component, possibly in tandem with the AWT flaw. This could also result in a Denial of Service condition or information disclosure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Position**:  An attacker must be able to reach a vulnerable system over a network.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication, allowing for straightforward exploitation.
*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content**: The attacker needs to serve a malicious Java applet or web start application to a user.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability affects multiple products such as IBM Java, OpenJDK, and HP-UX JDK.
* Multiple vendors and projects have addressed the issue by releasing patches for their respective products.

This combined information provides a thorough understanding of the CVE-2012-0502 vulnerability.
