Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to **CVE-2012-0371**:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control, specifically related to CPU-based Access Control Lists (ACLs) on Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An unauthenticated attacker can bypass configured CPU-based ACLs and gain unauthorized access to the WLC, allowing them to view and modify the device's configuration. This is specifically when an ACL is configured on the WLC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:** An attacker can view the WLC's configuration, potentially exposing sensitive information such as network keys, security policies, and user credentials.
- **Integrity:** An attacker can modify the WLC's configuration, potentially disrupting network services, redirecting traffic, or altering security policies. This can allow them to gain access to the wireless network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by connecting to the WLC over TCP port 1023.
- The attack vector is network based, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network as the WLC, or have network access to it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be unauthenticated.
- The attacker requires network access to the WLC on TCP port 1023.
- The attacker does not need any prior access, other than being able to reach the device.

**Affected Products:**
- Only specific models are affected by this vulnerability when CPU-based ACLs are configured:
    - Cisco 4400 Series WLCs
    - Cisco Wireless Services Modules (WiSM) version 1
    - Cisco Catalyst 3750G Integrated WLCs

**Additional Details**
-  The advisory provides a CVSS score (Base: 9.3, Temporal: 7.7) with a vector of `AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C`. This indicates that the vulnerability is network-based, has medium complexity, requires no authentication, and has complete impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It is also functionally exploitable and there is an official fix.
- The document provides workarounds which involve configuring ACLs to block access on TCP port 1023. It should be noted that this vulnerability is only present when CPU-based ACLs are configured
- The advisory provides the first fixed release per affected versions, noting if a version is vulnerable or not.
