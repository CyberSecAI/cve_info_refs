  "CVE-2012-0455": {
    "description": "Soroush Dalili discovered that a cross-site scripting countermeasure related to Javascript URLs could be bypassed. Specifically, Firefox does not adequately protect against dropping JavaScript links onto a frame. A remote attacker could, through cross-site scripting (XSS), exploit this to modify the contents or steal confidential data. By using a javascript: URL while also capitalizing some of the letters, the check can be bypassed.",
