{
  "cveId": "CVE-2012-0030",
  "description": "An authenticated user may craft malicious commands to affect resources on tenants he is not a member of, potentially leading to incorrect billing, quota escaping or compromise of computing resources created by a third-party. Only setups allowing the OpenStack API are affected.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in how Nova API nodes handle incoming requests. Specifically, the `project_id` from the URI could overwrite the authenticated user's context, granting access to other tenants resources.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference",
      "Insufficient Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated user could potentially create, modify, or delete resources belonging to other tenants, leading to incorrect billing, quota violations, and potential compromise of computing resources. This could also be used to evade quota limits.",
    "attackVectors": "A remote authenticated attacker can craft malicious commands by manipulating the `project_id` in the URI of an OpenStack API request.",
     "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate with the OpenStack API. Additionally, the attacker needs to know or guess the project IDs of other tenants to craft the malicious requests."
