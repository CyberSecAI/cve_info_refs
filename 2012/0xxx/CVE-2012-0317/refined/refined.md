Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue found in the commenting and community functionality of Movable Type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF:**  The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to potentially trick a logged-in user's browser into sending malicious requests to the Movable Type server without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   If a user is logged into Movable Type and visits a malicious web page controlled by the attacker, the attacker can:
    *   Change settings on the Movable Type installation.
    *   View or alter data within the application.
    *   Execute arbitrary script code on victimâ€™s browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based.
*   The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to visit a malicious web page. This can be done through various social engineering techniques, like sending a link via email or posting it on a forum.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious web page.
*   The attacker must also understand the request structure of the Movable Type application in order to craft malicious requests.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to the Movable Type application itself. They rely on the user's existing authenticated session.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Movable Type, specifically versions 5.12, 5.06, 4.37, 4.292 and earlier.
*   The vendor has released updated versions (5.13, 5.07, and 4.38) that address this issue.
*   The provided content also mentions other vulnerabilities fixed in the same updates, including OS Command Injection and XSS, however, these are not related to CVE-2012-0317.
