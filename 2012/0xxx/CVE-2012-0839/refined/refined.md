Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a vulnerability in hash table implementations where the hash functions are predictable and invertible. This allows an attacker to craft input that causes mass hash collisions, leading to a significant performance degradation and effectively a denial-of-service (DoS). Specifically, the issue stems from using non-cryptographically secure hash functions that are vulnerable to collision attacks, meaning an attacker can generate many keys that map to the same bucket within the hash table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Hash Functions:** The primary weakness is the use of hash functions (like MurmurHash3 in OCaml) that are not cryptographically secure and are vulnerable to collision attacks.
*   **Lack of Collision Handling:** When many keys collide in the same bucket, the performance degrades to O(n) where n is the number of keys in the hash table, rather than O(1), if a good distribution of keys occurs. This makes operations on the hash table very slow which leads to a denial-of-service.
*   **No Dynamic Hash Function Selection**: The standard library in OCaml does not allow setting hash functions dynamically making it impossible to switch to a randomized hash function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service by sending specially crafted requests with numerous parameters that cause hash collisions. This leads to excessive CPU usage and slows down the application, making it unresponsive. The CPU usage can reach 100% and last for hours depending on the target application and server performance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The most common attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP POST requests containing many parameters specifically designed to cause hash collisions.
*   **Untrusted Input:** The vulnerability extends beyond web requests, affecting any application that uses hash tables to process data from untrusted sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Network Requests:** Attackers need the ability to send network requests, such as HTTP POST requests, to the vulnerable server or application.
*   **Knowledge of Hash Function:** Attackers need knowledge or the ability to reverse engineer the used hash function to generate colliding keys.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. It can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is not specific to OCaml but affects a variety of programming languages including Java, JRuby, PHP, Python, Rubinius, and Ruby.
*   The vulnerability is similar to the one reported in 2003, which affected the Perl language.
*   Some languages like Ruby 1.9.x and later address this vulnerability by using randomization of the hash function which prevents collision attacks.
*   One of the proposed fixes is to use "randomized" hash tables, where the hash function is picked randomly when the hash table is created making it difficult to create an attack request, because the hash function is not predictable.
*   Another mitigation strategy is to use data structures like balanced binary trees (Sets in OCaml) which do not suffer from the same collision-related performance issues.
*   The OCaml Core library reimplemented hash tables to use an AVL tree in the buckets as a mitigation, so even with pathological collisions the performance degrades gracefully to O(log n).
