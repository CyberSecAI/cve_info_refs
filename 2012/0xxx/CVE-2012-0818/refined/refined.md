{
  "CVE-2012-0818": {
    "description": "RESTEasy permits XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. If a RESTEasy endpoint is deployed, a user can submit a request containing an external XML entity. This XML entity will be resolved, allowing a remote attacker to read files in the context of the user running the application server. This flaw affects DOM Document, JAXB and Fast Infoset (FI) input.",
    "root_cause": "The RESTEasy framework was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks due to insecure parsing of XML data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could read arbitrary files accessible to the user running the application server. The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, such as configuration files, user data, and other server-side files.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker could send a crafted XML request containing an external entity to a RESTEasy endpoint.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to a RESTEasy endpoint, no specific authentication requirements or special privileges are needed. The attacker should be able to inject malicious XML payload."
