# USN-1586-1: Emacs vulnerabilities

27 September 2012

Emacs could be made to run programs as your login if it opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [emacs23](/security/cves?package=emacs23) - The GNU Emacs editor (with GTK+ user interface)

## Details

Hiroshi Oota discovered that Emacs incorrectly handled search paths. If a

user were tricked into opening a file with Emacs, a local attacker could

execute arbitrary Lisp code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-0035](/security/CVE-2012-0035))

Paul Ling discovered that Emacs incorrectly handled certain eval forms in

local-variable sections. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted file with Emacs, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary Lisp

code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-3479](/security/CVE-2012-3479))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [emacs23-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/emacs23)
  -
  [23.3+1-1ubuntu9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/emacs23/23.3%2B1-1ubuntu9.1)
* [emacs23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/emacs23)
  -
  [23.3+1-1ubuntu9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/emacs23/23.3%2B1-1ubuntu9.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [emacs23-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/emacs23)
  -
  [23.3+1-1ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/emacs23/23.3%2B1-1ubuntu4.1)
* [emacs23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/emacs23)
  -
  [23.3+1-1ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/emacs23/23.3%2B1-1ubuntu4.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart Emacs to make all the

necessary changes.

Please use CVE-2012-0035 for this issue (for both Emacs and CEDET).

## Security flaw in EDE; new release plans

| **Subject**: | Security flaw in EDE; new release plans |

```
Hiroshi Oota has found a security flaw in EDE (part of CEDET), a
development tool included in Emacs.  EDE can store various information
about a project, such as how to build the project, in a file named
Project.ede in the project directory tree.  When the minor mode
`global-ede-mode' is enabled, visiting a file causes Emacs to look for
Project.ede in the file's directory or one of its parent directories.
If Project.ede is present, Emacs automatically reads and evaluates the
first Lisp expression in it.

This design exposes EDE users to the danger of loading malicious code
from one file (Project.ede), simply by visiting another file in the same
directory tree.

A patch to fix this problem, for the Emacs 23.3 release, is attached.
It prevents EDE from loading Project.ede files, except in directories
explicitly designated as "safe" by the user via the new list variable
`ede-project-directories'.  The value of this variable is initially the
empty list; Emacs offers to add to it when the user invokes the `M-x
ede' or `M-x ede-new' command.  EDE project types that do not use
Project.ede (e.g. those that scan makefiles for build information) are
unaffected, since they do not involve loading Lisp code.

Due to this problem, we will make a 23.4 release from the emacs-23
branch.  I have committed the above fix to the branch, and will shortly
commit another more complicated fix from Eric Ludlam which tries to
prevent CEDET classes from loading unsafe forms at all.  In a few days,
I will make the 23.3.90 pretest; during this brief window, if anyone
thinks there is another bug fix that ought to go into 23.4, please
promptly raise the issue on emacs-devel---but we will be very
conservative about allowing commits, in order to release 23.4 ASAP.  If
no serious problems are found with the 23.3.90 pretest, the 23.4 release
will probably follow right after.

I will also make a new Emacs 24 pretest (24.0.93) soon, incorporating
the same fixes.  Until then, Emacs pretesters should be aware of this
security flaw if they use EDE.  The upstream CEDET project will also be
making a new security release.

Thanks to Hiroshi Oota for pointing out the flaw, and to Eric Ludlam and
David Engster for working on the fix.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

Subject: CVE Request: CEDET/Emacs global-ede-mode file loading vulnerability

I'll assign this a CVE once I have determined the code base status (are
these considered the same codebase, or have they forked enough to be
considered separate code bases? Also I need to ensure this hasn't
already been assigned a CVE. CC'ing relevant developers as well.

EMACS

Hiroshi Oota has found a security flaw in EDE (part of CEDET), a
development tool included in Emacs.  EDE can store various information
about a project, such as how to build the project, in a file named
Project.ede in the project directory tree.  When the minor mode
`global-ede-mode' is enabled, visiting a file causes Emacs to look for
Project.ede in the file's directory or one of its parent directories.
If Project.ede is present, Emacs automatically reads and evaluates the
first Lisp expression in it.

This design exposes EDE users to the danger of loading malicious code
from one file (Project.ede), simply by visiting another file in the same
directory tree.

trunk and newtrunk were updated.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
