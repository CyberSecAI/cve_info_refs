# can cause root user to remove arbitrary files

Bug #973687 reported by
[Kees Cook](https://launchpad.net/~kees)
on 2012-04-04

[262](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |

|  | [whoopsie-daisy (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/whoopsie-daisy "Latest release: 0.1.34.1, uploaded to main on 2015-11-09 21:37:11.877739+00:00 by Brian Murray (brian-murray), maintained by Evan (ev)") | Fix Released | Critical | [Evan](https://launchpad.net/~ev) |  |

### Bug Description

/etc/cron.daily/whoopsie does not use NULL terminated filenames when examining the world-writable directory /var/crash. This allows users to inject whitespace into filenames causing "rm" to delete relative files in the current directory (which happens to be "/" due to it being run from cron) or the /var/crash directory. While there really shouldn't be any \_files\_ in /, it could be a DoS, and at the least allows removal of other people's crash reports.

For example:

$ touch "/var/crash/chicken monkey duck.uploaded"

$ find /var/crash -name '\*.uploaded' -type f -size 0 | sed 's,\(.\*\).uploaded$,\1.upload \1.uploaded,'

/var/crash/chicken monkey duck.upload /var/crash/chicken monkey duck.uploaded

/var/crash/monkey.upload /var/crash/monkey.uploaded

The above would lead to removing /var/crash/chicken and /monkey

Uh, it's more serious than just files in / and /var/crash, you can delete any file on the filesystem with this. e.g.

$ mkdir '/var/crash/chicken monkey/'

$ touch /var/crash/chicken\ monkey/fling\ duck.uploaded

$ find /var/crash -name '\*.uploaded' -type f -size 0 | sed 's,\(.\*\).uploaded$,\1.upload \1.uploaded,'

/var/crash/chicken monkey/fling duck.upload /var/crash/chicken monkey/fling duck.uploaded

i.e. it will attempt to delete monkey/fling; obviously anything else can be substituted for monkey/fling, like say etc/shadow.

The command should handle files with embedded newlines, and shouldn't enter into subdirectories as that can be raced.

Normally, something like this could be used:

find /var/crash -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -name '\*.uploaded' -type f -size 0 -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf

Attempting to use the additional sed in there is difficult, and I can't think of a way to do it properly right now.

How about just erasing whatever is old?

find /var/crash -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -name '\*.upload\*' -type f -mtime +7 -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf

In theory .uploaded files should always be newer than .upload files...so the job could in theory erase an .upload file without erasing the .uploaded file, which will then get erased the next day.

This bug was fixed in the package whoopsie-daisy - 0.1.26

---------------

whoopsie-daisy (0.1.26) precise; urgency=low

\* Take ownership of the NetworkManager state variant on setup and

    unref it, plugging a memory leak.

  \* Log the reason the server rejected the submitted crash report.

  \* Send the Whoopsie version with each crash submission.

  \* Delete both .upload and .uploaded files after 14 days. Thanks
