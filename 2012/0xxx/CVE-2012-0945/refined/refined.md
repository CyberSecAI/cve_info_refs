Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-0945:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `/etc/cron.daily/whoopsie` script in the `whoopsie-daisy` package did not properly handle filenames with whitespace when processing crash reports in the `/var/crash` directory. Specifically, it used `find` and `sed` to generate commands for removing crash report files, but this approach did not account for filenames with spaces.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection via Filenames:** The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper quoting or null termination when handling filenames passed to the `rm` command. By injecting filenames with whitespace, attackers could manipulate the `rm` command to delete arbitrary files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Insecure Usage of `find` and `sed`**: The script employed `find` to locate files and then piped the output to `sed` to construct `rm` commands.  This technique is vulnerable to injection when filenames contain whitespace or special characters as `sed` is used to add suffixes and create two arguments for `rm`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker could create specially crafted filenames in `/var/crash` containing spaces which would lead to `rm` deleting arbitrary files on the filesystem including those outside the `/var/crash` directory. This includes critical system files, leading to a denial of service and potentially compromising the system's integrity.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Deletion of critical system files or large numbers of files would result in system instability or complete system failure.
*  **Removal of Other User's Crash Reports:** At the very least, an attacker could remove other user's crash reports.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **File Creation:** The attacker must be able to create files within the `/var/crash` directory with crafted filenames that contain whitespace or special characters.
*   **Cron Job Execution:** The vulnerability is triggered by the execution of the `/etc/cron.daily/whoopsie` script, which is run automatically by the cron daemon.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to write to `/var/crash`:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges to create files and directories in the `/var/crash` directory. This is typically achieved by a local user, or via a vulnerability that allows writing to this directory.
*   **Knowledge of the script's vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the `whoopsie` script does not properly sanitize filenames.

**Additional details:**

*   The bug report notes the vulnerability was discovered by Tavis Ormandy and reported by Kees Cook
*   The vulnerability is present due to the way the `whoopsie` cron job attempts to cleanup old crash report files by using `find` and `sed` to construct `rm` commands
*   The fix implemented in `whoopsie-daisy 0.1.26` changes the cleanup logic to delete old files by using `find ... -print0 | xargs -0 rm -rf`, and uses a time-based method, removing files older than 14 days to avoid the filename parsing vulnerability.
