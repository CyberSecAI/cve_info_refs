Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu` package, which displays a slideshow during Ubuntu system installation, fetches a Twitter feed. The application was not verifying the SSL certificate when accessing the Twitter feed over HTTPS, which made it vulnerable to a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Furthermore, the application was not properly encoding URLs received from the Twitter feed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Lack of SSL Certificate Validation:** The application did not validate the SSL certificate of the server providing the Twitter feed, allowing an attacker to intercept and modify the traffic.
2.  **Improper URL Encoding:** URLs received from the Twitter feed were not properly encoded, enabling an attacker to inject malicious code, such as JavaScript.
3.  **Vulnerable Browser Engine**: The browser engine used to interpret the Twitter feed is outdated and does not receive security updates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

A successful MITM attack could allow an attacker to:

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Inject malicious code (JavaScript) into the Twitter feed, which when executed in the context of the slideshow, could read arbitrary files from the filesystem of the machine being installed.
*   **Code Injection:** Inject arbitrary Javascript into the slideshow displayed during system install, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the system being installed and the Twitter server could intercept and modify the data stream.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic, typically by being on the same network as the system being installed or by controlling network infrastructure.
*  **Technical Knowledge**: An understanding of MITM attacks, SSL, and Javascript injection is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
*   The initial fix attempted to always access Twitter over HTTPS and properly encode the URLs, but it was insufficient due to the lack of SSL certificate validation.
*   The final fix involved disabling the Twitter feed completely in the Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS installation images.
*   The issue was initially reported as "Arbitrary file disclosure via MITM of twitter feed".
*   The vulnerability is present because the slideshow uses an outdated webkit engine that doesn't get security updates.
*   The fix was released in `ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu` version 58.2.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a "Critical" importance.
