{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improperly escaped user input for SQL queries",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection in SoapServlet servlet (Printer.getPrinterAgentKey)",
    "Stack buffer overflow in Isig.isigCtl.1 ActiveX Control (RunAndUploadFile function)",
    "SQL Injection in register.do servlet (User.updateUserValue)",
    "SQL Injection in logon.do servlet (User.isExistingUser)",
    "SQL Injection in CallHomeExec servlet (Asset.getHWKey)",
    "SQL Injection in getAttachment servlet (Asset.getMimeType)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager Express for Software Distribution. SQL injections allow attackers to read sensitive data like the admin password, modify user rights and ultimately gain SYSTEM level access.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Network (via HTTP requests to vulnerable servlets)",
    "User interaction required to open a malicious page or file hosting the malicious ActiveX control."
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Network access to the vulnerable server (for SQL injection vulnerabilities)",
     "Ability to entice a user to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file (for ActiveX control vulnerability)"
  ]
}
