Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2012-0149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the Ancillary Function Driver (afd.sys) improperly validating input passed from user mode to the Windows kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation in the afd.sys driver.
- The driver fails to adequately check data received from user-mode before passing it to the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to run code with elevated privileges.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary code, taking complete control of the affected system.
- This control allows them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack vector.
- Requires the attacker to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to the system locally.
- The attacker must run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the target system with valid user credentials.
- Ability to execute a specially crafted application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Ancillary Function Driver (AFD), which supports Windows sockets applications.
- The afd.sys driver operates in kernel mode and manages the Winsock TCP/IP communications protocol.
- The fix involves correcting the way the AFD validates input from user mode before passing it to the kernel.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released.
- No reports of exploitation were received by Microsoft before the bulletin was issued.
- The vulnerability affects various 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2.

**Note:** This CVE is related to another CVE-2012-0148, which also affects the AFD driver but is not exploitable on 32-bit systems. CVE-2012-0149 affects some 32-bit versions of Windows server 2003.
