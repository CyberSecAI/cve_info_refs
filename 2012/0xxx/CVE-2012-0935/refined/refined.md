Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2012-0935:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `PageID` parameter of the `Default.aspx` page, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data, modify database content or even gain control of the database server through crafted SQL queries.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending HTTP GET requests with crafted `PageID` parameters.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the target web application. No specific authentication or privilege is stated as necessary.
2.  **File Upload Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows unauthenticated file uploads via the `fckeditor` component.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure configuration or lack of restrictions in the `fckeditor` file upload functionality. Specifically, the `test.html` connector in `/FA/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/` is accessible and allows setting the connector to `ASP.Net` and performing arbitrary file uploads.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can upload arbitrary files, including malicious scripts, which can be executed on the server, potentially leading to complete server compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the `/FA/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/test.html` page, followed by setting the connector type and uploading a file.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the target web application. No specific authentication or privilege is stated as necessary.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

The content describes two distinct vulnerabilities within the ARYADAD application: a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `Default.aspx` page and a file upload vulnerability in the `fckeditor` component. Both vulnerabilities can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the vulnerable server.
