# Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 Released

January 23, 2025

The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are
pleased to [announce](https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement2.4.html)
the release of version 2.4.63 of the Apache
HTTP Server ("Apache"). This version of Apache is our latest GA
release of the new generation 2.4.x branch of Apache HTTPD and
represents fifteen years of innovation by the project, and is
recommended over all previous releases. This release of Apache is
a security, feature and bug fix release.

We consider this release to be the best version of Apache available, and
encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 is available for download from:

<https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>

Please see the [CHANGES\_2.4](./CHANGES_2.4) file, linked from the download page, for a
full list of changes. A condensed list, [CHANGES\_2.4.63](./CHANGES_2.4.63) includes only
those changes introduced since the prior 2.4 release. A summary of all
of the security vulnerabilities addressed in this and earlier releases
is available:

<https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html>

This release requires the Apache Portable Runtime (APR), minimum version
1.5.x, and APR-Util, minimum version 1.5.x. Some features may require the 1.6.x
version of both APR and APR-Util. The APR libraries must be upgraded for
all features of httpd to operate correctly.

Apache HTTP Server 2.4 provides a number of improvements and enhancements
over the 2.2 version. A listing and description of these features is
available via:

<https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/new_features_2_4.html>

This release builds on and extends the Apache 2.2 API. Modules written
for Apache 2.2 will need to be recompiled in order to run with Apache
2.4, and require minimal or no source code changes.

<https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/branches/2.4.x/VERSIONING>

When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please bear in mind
that if you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs (other
than the Prefork MPM), you must ensure that any modules you will be
using (and the libraries they depend on) are thread-safe.

Please note the 2.2.x branch has now passed the end of life at the Apache
HTTP Server project and no further activity will occur including security
patches. Users must promptly complete their transitions to this 2.4.x
release of httpd to benefit from further bug fixes or new features.

- /etc/init.d/apache2: new argument "check-reload". Exits 1
if httpd2 runs on deleted binaries such as after package
update, else 0. This is used by equally modified
/etc/logrotate.d/apache2, which uses "/etc/init.d/apache2
check-reload" in its prerotate script. These changes
prevent httpd2 from being (gracefully) reloaded by
logrotate, executed by cron, if new binaries have been
installed. Instead, a warning is printed on stdout and is
being logged to the syslogs. If this happens, apache's
logs are NOT rotated, and the running processes are left
untouched. This limits the maximum damage of log rotation
to unrotated logs. "/etc/init.d/apache2 restart" (or
"rcapache2 restart") must be executed manually in such a
case. [bnc#728876]

# Apache HTTP Server 2.4 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.4. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

*The initial GA release, Apache httpd 2.4.1, includes fixes for all vulnerabilities which have been resolved in Apache httpd 2.2.22 and all older releases. Consult the [Apache httpd 2.2 vulnerabilities list](vulnerabilities_22.html) for more information.*

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.62

### important: Apache HTTP Server: source code disclosure with handlers configured via AddType ([CVE-2024-40725](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40725))

A partial fix for CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers.

### moderate: Apache HTTP Server: HTTP/2 stream memory not reclaimed right away on RST ([CVE-2023-45802](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45802))

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

### important: HTTP request splitting with mod\_rewrite and mod\_proxy ([CVE-2023-25690](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25690))

Some mod\_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.

Configurations are affected when mod\_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution.

For example, something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.\*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning.

### moderate: Possible NULL dereference or SSRF in forward proxy configurations in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.51 and earlier ([CVE-2021-44224](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44224))

A crafted URI sent to httpd configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a crash (NULL pointer dereference) or, for configurations mixing forward and reverse proxy declarations, can allow for requests to be directed to a declared Unix Domain Socket endpoint (Server Side Request Forgery).

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.7 up to 2.4.51 (included).

### critical: Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 and 2.4.50 (incomplete fix of CVE-2021-41773) ([CVE-2021-42013](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-42013))

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

### critical: Path traversal and file disclosure vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 ([CVE-2021-41773](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41773))

A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives.

If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution.

### important: NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request ([CVE-2021-31618](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-31618))

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.

This rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.

This issue affected mod\_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.

### important: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header ([CVE-2020-9490](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9490))

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

### low: Limited cross-site scripting in mod\_proxy error page ([CVE-2019-10092](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10092))

A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod\_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed. We have taken this opportunity to also remove request data from many other in-built error messages. Note however this issue did not affect them directly and their output was already escaped to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

When mod\_remoteip was configured to use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the "PROXY" protocol, a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer deference. This vulnerability could only be triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients.

### low: Out of bound write in mod\_authnz\_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values ([CVE-2017-15710](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15710))

mod\_authnz\_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.

### moderate: Tampering of mod\_session data for CGI applications ([CVE-2018-1283](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283))

When mod\_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP\_SESSION" variable name used by mod\_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP\_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. The severity is set to Moderate because "SessionEnv on" is not a default nor common configuration, it should be considered more severe when this is the case though, because of the possible remote exploitation.

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: Uninitialized memory reflection in mod\_auth\_digest ([CVE-2017-9788](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9788))

The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments. by mod\_auth\_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### low: Padding Oracle in Apache mod\_session\_crypto ([CVE-2016-0736](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0736))

Prior to Apache HTTP release 2.4.25, mod\_sessioncrypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC. An authentication tag (SipHash MAC) is now added to prevent such attacks.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### low: ap\_some\_auth\_required API unusable ([CVE-2015-3185](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-3185))

A design error in the "ap\_some\_auth\_required" function renders the API unusuable in httpd 2.4.x. In particular the API is documented to answering if the request required authentication but only answers if there are Require lines in the applicable configuration. Since 2.4.x Require lines are used for authorization as well and can appear in configurations even when no authentication is required and the request is entirely unrestricted. This could lead to modules using this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so. API users should use the new ap\_some\_authn\_required API added in 2.4.16 instead.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Instead, de-allocation was deferred to      connection close. A client could send new requests and resets,      keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory      footprint to keep on growing.

[Yann Ylavic]    *) mod_http2: version 2.0.11 of the module, synchronizing changes      with the gitgub version. This is a partial rewrite of how connections      and streams are handled.      - an APR pollset and pipes (where supported) are used to monitor        the main connection and react to IO for request/response handling.        This replaces the stuttered timed waits of earlier versions.      - H2SerializeHeaders directive still exists, but has no longer an effect.      - Clients that seemingly misbehave still get less resources allocated,        but ongoing requests are no longer disrupted.      - Fixed an issue since 1.15.24 that "Server" headers in proxied requests        were overwritten instead of preserved. [PR by @daum3ns]      - A regression in v1.15.24 was fixed that could lead to httpd child        processes not being terminated on a graceful reload or when reaching        MaxConnectionsPerChild. When unprocessed h2 requests were queued at        the time, these could stall. See #212.      - Improved information displayed in 'server-status' for H2 connections when        Extended Status is enabled. Now one can see the last request that IO        operations happened on and transferred IO stats are updated as well.      - When reaching server limits, such as MaxRequestsPerChild, the HTTP/2 connection        send a GOAWAY frame much too early on new connections, leading to invalid        protocol state and a client failing the request. See PR65731 at        https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65731 .        The module now initializes the HTTP/2 protocol correctly and allows the        client to submit one request before the shutdown via a GOAWAY frame        is being announced.      - :scheme pseudo-header values, not matching the        connection scheme, are forwarded via absolute uris to the        http protocol processing to preserve semantics of the request.        Checks on combinations of pseudo-headers values/absence        have been added as described in RFC 7540. Fixes #230.      - A bug that prevented trailers (e.g. HEADER frame at the end) to be        generated in certain cases was fixed. See #233 where it prevented        gRPC responses to be properly generated.      - Request and response header values are automatically stripped of leading        and trialing space/tab characters. This is equivalent behaviour to what        Apache httpd's http/1.1 parser does.        The checks for this in nghttp2 v1.50.0+ are disabled.      - Extensive testing in production done by Alessandro Bianchi (@alexskynet)        on the v2.0.x versions for stability.

See PR65731.         The module now initializes the HTTP/2 protocol correctly and         allows the client to submit one request before the shutdown         via a GOAWAY frame is being announced.      2.

Use the new directive `MDExternalAccountBinding` to provide the       server with the value for key identifier and hmac as provided by       your CA.       While working on some servers, EAB handling is not uniform       across CAs. First tests with a Sectigo Certificate Manager in       demo mode are successful. But ZeroSSL, for example, seems to       regard EAB values as a one-time-use-only thing, which makes them       fail if you create a seconde account or retry the creation of the       first account with the same EAB.     - The directive 'MDCertificateAuthority' now checks if its parameter       is a http/https url or one of a set of known names. Those are       'LetsEncrypt', 'LetsEncrypt-Test', 'Buypass' and 'Buypass-Test'       for now and they are not case-sensitive.

Now, if such are seen in a previous       order, a new order is created for a clean start over again.

[Yann Ylavic]    *) core: Fix a regression that stripped the ETag header from 304 responses.      PR 61820 [Ruediger Pluem, Roy T. Fielding]    *) core: Adding SSL related inquiry functions to the server API.      These function are always available, even when no module providing      SSL is loaded. They provide their own "shadowing" implementation for      the optional functions of similar name that mod_ssl and impersonators      of mod_ssl provide.      This enables loading of several SSL providing modules when all but      one of them registers itself into the new hooks. Two old-style SSL      modules will not work, as they replace the others optional functions      with their own.      Modules using the old-style optional functions will continue to work      as core supplies its own versions of those.      The following has been added so far:      - ap_ssl_conn_is_ssl() to query if a connection is using SSL.      - ap_ssl_var_lookup() to query SSL related variables for a        server/connection/request.      - Hooks for 'ssl_conn_is_ssl' and 'ssl_var_lookup' where modules        providing SSL can install their own value supplying functions.      - ap_ssl_add_cert_files() to enable other modules like mod_md to provide        certificate and keys for an SSL module like mod_ssl.      - ap_ssl_add_fallback_cert_files() to enable other modules like mod_md to        provide a fallback certificate in case no 'proper' certificate is        available for an SSL module like mod_ssl.      - ap_ssl_answer_challenge() to enable other modules like mod_md to        provide a certificate as used in the RFC 8555 'tls-alpn-01' challenge        for the ACME protocol for an SSL module like mod_ssl. The function        and its hook provide PEM encoded data instead of file names.      - Hooks for 'ssl_add_cert_files', 'ssl_add_fallback_cert_files' and        'ssl_answer_challenge' where modules like mod_md can provide providers        to the above mentioned functions.      - These functions reside in the new 'http_ssl.h' header file. [Stefan Eissing]    *) core/mod_ssl/mod_md: adding OCSP response provisioning as core feature. This      allows modules to access and provide OCSP response data without being tied      of each other. The data is exchanged in standard, portable formats (PEM encoded      certificates and DER encoded responses), so that the actual SSL/crypto      implementations used by the modules are independant of each other.      Registration and retrieval happen in the context of a server (server_rec)      which modules may use to decide if they are configured for this or not.      The area of changes:      1. core: defines 2 functions in include/http_ssl.h, so that modules may         register a certificate, together with its issuer certificate for OCSP         response provisioning and ask for current response data (DER bytes) later.         Also, 2 hooks are defined that allow modules to implement this OCSP         provisioning.       2. mod_ssl uses the new functions, in addition to what it did already, to         register its certificates this way. If no one is interested in providing         OCSP, it falls back to its own (if configured) stapling implementation.      3. mod_md registers itself at the core hooks for OCSP provisioning. Depending         on configuration, it will accept registrations of its own certificates only,         all certificates or none.      [Stefan Eissing]   *) mod_md: v2.4.0 with improvements and bugfixes      - MDPrivateKeys allows the specification of several types. Beside "RSA" plus      optional key lengths elliptic curves can be configured. This means you can      have multiple certificates for a Managed Domain with different key types.      With ```MDPrivateKeys secp384r1 rsa2048``` you get one ECDSA  and one RSA      certificate and all modern client will use the shorter ECDSA, while older      client will get the RSA certificate.      Many thanks to @tlhackque who pushed and helped on this.      - Support added for MDomains consisting of a wildcard. Configuring      ```MDomain *.host.net``` will match all virtual hosts matching that pattern      and obtain one certificate for it (assuming you have 'dns-01' challenge      support configured). Addresses #239.      - Removed support for ACMEv1 servers. The only known installation used to      be Let's Encrypt which has disabled that version more than a year ago for      new accounts.      - Andreas Ulm ( https://github.com/root360-AndreasUlm implemented the      ```renewing``` call to ```MDMessageCmd``` that can deny a certificate      renewal attempt. This is useful in clustered installations, as      discussed in #233).      - New event ```challenge-setup: type: domain ```, triggered when the      challenge data for a domain has been created. This is invoked before the      ACME server is told to check for it. The type is one of the ACME challenge      types. This is invoked for every DNS name in a MDomain.      - The max delay for retries has been raised to daily (this is like all      retries jittered somewhat to avoid repeats at fixed time of day).      - Certain error codes reported by the ACME server that indicate a problem      with the configured data now immediately switch to daily retries. For      example: if the ACME server rejects a contact email or a domain name,      frequent retries will most likely not solve the problem. But daily retries      still make sense as there might be an error at the server and un-supervised      certificate renewal is the goal. Refs #222.      - Test case and work around for domain names > 64 octets. Fixes #227.      When the first DNS name of an MD is longer than 63 octets, the certificate      request will not contain a CN field, but leave it up to the CA to choose one.      Currently, Lets Encrypt looks for a shorter name in the SAN list given and      fails the request if none is found. But it is really up to the CA (and what      browsers/libs accept here) and may change over the years. That is why      the decision is best made at the CA.      - Retry delays now have a random +/-[0-50]% modification applied to let      retries from several servers spread out more, should they have been      restarted at the same time of day.      - Fixed several places where the 'badNonce' return code from an ACME server      was not handled correctly. The test server 'pebble' simulates this behaviour      by default and helps nicely in verifying this behaviour. Thanks, pebble!      - Set the default `MDActivationDelay` to 0. This was confusing to users that      new certificates were deemed not usably before a day of delay. When clocks are      correct, using a new certificate right away should not pose a problem.      - When handling ACME authorization resources, the module no longer requires      the server to return a "Location" header, as was necessary in ACMEv1.      Fixes #216.      - Fixed a theoretical uninitialized read when testing for JSON error responses      from the ACME CA. Reported at  https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=64297 .      - ACME problem reports from CAs that include parameters in the Content-Type      header are handled correctly. (Previously, the problem text would not be      reported and retries could exceed CA limits.)      - Account Update transactions to V2 CAs now use the correct POST-AS-GET method.      Previously, an empty JSON object was sent - which apparently LE accepted,      but others reject.

Xerox Security Bulletin XRX13-003

FreeFlow Print Server v8
January 2013 Security Patch Cluster (includes Java 6 Update 37 Software)
v1.0
2/26/2013

Background

Oracle delivers quarterly Critical Patch Updates (CPU) to address US-CERT-announced Security vulnerabilities
and deliver reliability improvements to the Solaris Operating System.  Oracle no longer provides these patches
to the general public, but Xerox is authorized to deliver them to Customers with active FreeFlow Print Server
(FFPS) Support contracts (FSMA).  Customers who may have an Oracle Support Contract for their non-FFPS
Solaris  Servers  should  not  install  patches  that  have  not  been  customized  by  Xerox.  Otherwise  the  FFPS
software could be damaged and result in downtime and a lengthy re-installation service call.

This bulletin announces the availability of the following:

Note: Xerox recommends that customers evaluate their security needs periodically and if they need Security
patches  to  address  the  above  CVE  issues,  schedule  an  activity  with  their  Xerox  Service  team  to  install  this
announced Security Patch Cluster.

Applicability

These Security updates are intended for Xerox printer products running one of the FFPS 73.C0.41 or 73.B3.61
SPAR software releases.  This Security patch update has only been tested on these software releases and it is
recommended that they be installed on these FFPS software release versions.  They have not been tested with
the FFPS 73.B0.73 and 73.A3.31 software releases.

The  Xerox  CSE/Analyst  is  provided  a  tool  (accessible  from  CFO  Web  site)  that  enables  them  to  confirm  the
currently  installed  FFPS  software  release,  Security  Patch  Cluster,  and  Java  Software  version.    When  this
Security update has been installed on the FFPS system, this script will output the following:

FFPS Release Version:
FFPS Patch Cluster:
Java Version:

8.0_SP-3 (82.C5.24.86)
January 2013
Java 6 Update 37

Patch Install Methods

The  install  of  these  Security  patches  must  be  performed  by  the  Xerox  Customer  Service  Engineer  (CSE)  or
Analyst.  The customer process to obtain this Security update is to call the Xerox support number to request
the service.

Xerox strives to deliver these critical Security patch updates in a timely manner.  They are available from the
Xerox  Support  organization,  and  can  be  delivered  electronically  over  the  Internet  to  the  FFPS  system  via  a
GUI tool called the FFPS Update Manager. The other method of delivery is an FTP transfer to the FFPS system
or  writing  the  patch  cluster  to  DVD/USB  media.    A  more  detailed  description  of  the  methods  used  by  the
CSE/Analyst to install the Security patches is as follows:

FFPS Update Manager GUI

Once the Security patches are ready for customer delivery they are made available from the Xerox Edge
Host  and  Download  servers.    The  CSE/Analyst  uses  the  Update  Manager  GUI  on  the  FFPS  system  to
download  and  install  the  Security  patches  over  the  Internet.    When  the  Xerox  server  is  checked  for
updates  from  FFPS  Update  Manager,  this  Security  patch  update  is  listed  as  “January  2013  Security
Patch Cluster (FFPS v8)”.

This requires that the FFPS system be configured with the customer proxy information to gain Security
patch  update  access  from  the  Xerox  servers.    The  connection  is  initiated  by  the  FFPS  system  and  the
Xerox  servers  do  not  have  access  to  the  customer  network.    The  Xerox  server  and  FFPS  system  both
authenticate  each  other  before  a  data  transfer  can  be  successfully  established  between  the  two  end
points.

Hard Disk, DVD/USB Media

Once  the  Security  patch  updates  are  ready  for  customer  delivery  they  are  made  available  on  the  CFO
Web site.  The CSE/Analyst can download and prepare for the install by writing the Security patch update
into a well-known directory on the FFPS system, or on DVD/USB media.  The FFPS Security Patch Cluster is
delivered  as  an  ISO  image  and  ZIP  archive  file  to  provide  the  Xerox  Service  Representative  options  to
choose an install method.  Once the patch cluster has been prepared on media an install script can be run
to perform the install.  The install  script accepts an argument that identifies the media that contains a
copy of the FFPS Security Patch Cluster.  (E.g., # installSecPatches.sh [ disk | dvd | usb ]).

Important: The install of this Security patch update can fail if the archive file containing the patches is
corrupted from file transfer or writing to DVD media.  There have been reported install failures when the
archive  file  written  on  DVD  media  was  corrupt.    The  Security  patch  update  could  be  corrupted  when
writing  to  media  by  particular  DVD  burn  applications  writing  on  some  DVD  media  types.    It  is  very
important that the Security patch archive written onto the DVD install media be verified with the original
archive file that was written to DVD.

The Security patch cluster is delivered as a ZIP and an ISO file.  The file size and check sum of these files
on Windows and Solaris are as follows:

Security Patch File

Windows Size (Kb)

Solaris Size (bytes)

Solaris Checksum

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip

1,663,512

1,703,435,583

54151  3327023

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.iso

1,615,862

1,703,794,688

13849  3327724

The Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip listed on the DVD media can be verified by comparing it to
the original archive file size and checksum.  Copy this archive to a location on the FFPS system and type
‘sum  Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip’  from  a  terminal  window.    The  checksum  value  should  be
‘54151    3327023’,  and  this  validates  the  correct  January  2013  Security  Patch  Cluster  is  written  on  the
DVD.
