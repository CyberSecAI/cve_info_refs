Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-0421:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The configuration file `/etc/auditlog-keeper.conf` was world-readable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive file permissions on the configuration file. World-readable permissions allow any user on the system to access the file.
*   **Credentials Storage:** The configuration file contained sensitive information, specifically "various passwords". Storing passwords in a plaintext or easily accessible format is a security risk.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read the configuration file and obtain sensitive data, including passwords. This could enable unauthorized access to the audit log system or related services.
*   **Compromise of other systems/services**: The passwords obtained could be reused or abused to compromise other systems or services which also rely on those credentials.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the affected system could read the configuration file. No network access is required for this attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a user account on the system where the vulnerable `auditlog-keeper` package is installed.
*   The attacker does not need root or administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects `auditlog-keeper` package in SUSE Manager 1.2 for SLE 11 SP1
*   The fix was implemented in version 0.2.1-0.4.6.1 of the `auditlog-keeper` package.
