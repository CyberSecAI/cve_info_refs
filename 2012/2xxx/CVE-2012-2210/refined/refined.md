{
  "cveId": "CVE-2012-2210",
  "description": "A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in Sony Bravia TVs. Sending a flood of SYN packets to the TV causes it to become unresponsive, restart, and eventually shut down.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The TV's network stack is overwhelmed by a flood of SYN packets, causing it to crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper rate limiting or resource management for handling network traffic.",
      "Vulnerable network stack implementation"
    ],
     "impact": "The TV becomes unresponsive, its functions cease working, it restarts multiple times, and eventually shuts down, requiring a physical power cycle to turn back on.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network-based attack, specifically sending a flood of SYN packets."
     ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the TV or have network access to it.",
     "additionalInformation": "The exploit uses the 'hping' tool to send the flood of SYN packets. The specific model tested was a Sony Bravia TV (KDL-32CX525). The TV initially becomes unresponsive and restarts several times before shutting down. The denial of service is achieved by overwhelming the TV with a high volume of SYN packets."
