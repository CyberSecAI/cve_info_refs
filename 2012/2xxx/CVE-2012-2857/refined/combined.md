This document describes the security content of iOS 6.1.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see [How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620).

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see [Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222).

## iOS 6.1

* **Identity Services**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Authentication relying on certificate-based Apple ID authentication may be bypassed

  Description: An error handling issue existed in Identity Services. If the user's AppleID certificate failed to validate, the user's AppleID was assumed to be the empty string. If multiple systems belonging to different users enter this state, applications relying on this identity determination may erroneously extend trust. This issue was addressed by ensuring that NULL is returned instead of an empty string.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0963

* **International Components for Unicode**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A canonicalization issue existed in the handling of the EUC-JP encoding, which could lead to a cross-site scripting attack on EUC-JP encoded websites. This issue was addressed by updating the EUC-JP mapping table.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3058 : Masato Kinugawa

* **Kernel**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: A user-mode process may be able to access the first page of kernel memory

  Description: The iOS kernel has checks to validate that the user-mode pointer and length passed to the copyin and copyout functions would not result in a user-mode process being able to directly access kernel memory. The checks were not being used if the length was smaller than one page. This issue was addressed through additional validation of the arguments to copyin and copyout.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0964 : Mark Dowd of Azimuth Security

* **Security**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: Several intermediate CA certificates were mistakenly issued by TURKTRUST. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other sensitive information. This issue was addressed by not allowing the incorrect SSL certificates.

* **StoreKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: JavaScript may be enabled in Mobile Safari without user interaction

  Description: If a user disabled JavaScript in Safari Preferences, visiting a site which displayed a Smart App Banner would re-enable JavaScript without warning the user. This issue was addressed by not enabling JavaScript when visiting a site with a Smart App Banner.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0974 : Andrew Plotkin of Zarfhome Software Consulting, Ben Madison of BitCloud, Marek Durcek

* **WebKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple memory corruption issues existed in WebKit. These issues were addressed through improved memory handling.
