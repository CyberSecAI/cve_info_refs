  "CVE-2012-2928": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way third-party XML parsers are used in JIRA and Confluence.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Improper handling of XML parsing, leading to potential denial of service (DoS) and local file reading.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could perform denial of service attacks, causing the server to become unavailable. In Confluence, attackers could also read local files that are accessible to the system user running the application.",
      "Attack vectors": "An authenticated JIRA user or, in the case of Confluence, any attacker (unauthenticated), can send specially crafted XML data to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "For JIRA, an attacker needs to be an authenticated user. For Confluence, no account is needed."
    },
     {
      "Root cause": "Vulnerability in how third-party XML parsers are used within Atlassian's JIRA and Confluence products",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "XML parsing vulnerability",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service attacks against the server. In Confluence, the attacker can also read local files accessible to the system user.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending malicious XML data",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "For JIRA, an authenticated user is needed. For Confluence, no authentication is required."
