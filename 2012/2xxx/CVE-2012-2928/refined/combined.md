This advisory discloses a **high severity** security vulnerability that exists in all versions of JIRA up to and including 5.0.0.

* **Customers** **who have downloaded and installed JIRA** should upgrade their existing JIRA installations to fix this vulnerability. We also provide a patch that you will be able to apply to existing installations of JIRA to fix this vulnerability. However, we recommend that you upgrade your complete JIRA installation rather than applying the patch.
* **Enterprise Hosted customers** need to request an upgrade by raising a support request at [http://support.atlassian.com](http://support.atlassian.com/) in the "Enterprise Hosting Support" project.
* **JIRA Studio and Atlassian OnDemand customers** are not affected by any of the issues described in this advisory.

Atlassian is committed to improving product security. The vulnerability listed in this advisory has been discovered by Atlassian, unless noted otherwise. The reporter may also have requested that we do not credit them.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this advisory, please raise a support request at <http://support.atlassian.com/>.

**In this advisory:**

## High Severity XML Parsing Vulnerability

### Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **high**, according to the scale published in [Severity Levels for Security Issues](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low. This vulnerability is **not** critical.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

### Description

We have identified and fixed a vulnerability in JIRA that results from the way third-party XML parsers are used in JIRA. This vulnerability allows an attacker who is an authenticated JIRA user to execute denial of service attacks against the JIRA server.

All versions of JIRA **up to and including 5.0.0** are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:
[JRA-27719](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-27719)
-
Getting issue details...
STATUS

The Tempo and Gliffy for JIRA plugins are also vulnerable to this exploit. If you are using these plugins with *any* version of JIRA, you will need to upgrade them (see '[Fix](#JIRASecurityAdvisory20120517-fix)' section below) or disable them.

### Risk Mitigation

We recommend that you upgrade your JIRA installation to fix this vulnerability.

Alternatively, if you are not in a position to upgrade immediately, you should disable public access (such as anonymous access and public signup) to your JIRA installation until you have applied the necessary patch or upgraded.

### Fix

**Upgrade** **(recommended)**

1. Upgrade to JIRA 5.0.1 or later which fixes this vulnerability. For a full description of this release, see the [JIRA 5.0.1 Release Notes](/jira/jira-5-0-1-release-notes-278693070.html). You can download this version of JIRA from the [download centre](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/JIRADownloadCenter.jspa).
2. Upgrade the following JIRA third-party plugins, if you are using them. The table below describes which version of the plugin you should upgrade to, depending on your JIRA version. See [Managing JIRA's Plugins](/jira/managing-add-ons-185729595.html) for instructions on how to upgrade a plugin. In general, you should upgrade these plugins to the latest available version compatible with your version of JIRA.

   | Plugin | JIRA 5.0 | JIRA 4.4 | JIRA 4.3 | JIRA 4.2 |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Gliffy plugin for JIRA | 3.7.1 | 3.7.1 | 3.7.1 | 3.7.1 |
   | Tempo | 7.0.3 | 6.5.0.2 | 6.4.3.1 | 6.4.3.1 |

**Patches (not recommended)**

We recommend patching only when you can neither upgrade nor apply external security controls. Patches are usually only provided for vulnerabilities of critical severity (as per our [Security Patch Policy](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-patch-policy)), as an interim solution until you can upgrade. You should not expect that you can continue patching your system instead of upgrading. Our patches are often non-cumulative – we do not recommend that you apply multiple patches from different advisories on top of each other, but strongly recommend upgrading to the most recent version regularly.

If for some reason you cannot upgrade to the latest version of JIRA, you must do all of the following steps to fix the vulnerability described in this security advisory.

1. Download the patch file for your version of JIRA. Note, the patches are only available for the point release indicated. If you are using an earlier point release for a major version, you must upgrade to the latest point release first.

   | Version | Patch |
   | --- | --- |
   | JIRA 4.4.5 | [patch-JRA-27719-4.4.5-atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/binary/patch-JRA-27719-4.4.5-atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip) |
   | JIRA 4.3.4 | [patch-JRA-27719-4.3.4-atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/binary/patch-JRA-27719-4.3.4-atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip) |
   | JIRA 4.2.4 | [patch-JRA-27719-4.2.4-atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/binary/patch-JRA-27719-4.2.4-atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip) |
   | JIRA 4.1.2 | [patch-JRA-27719-4.1.2-atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/binary/patch-JRA-27719-4.1.2-atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip) |
2. Update the following files in your JIRA installation, as described below.

   * JIRA:
     1. Shut down JIRA.
     2. Replace `$JIRA_INSTALL/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes/atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip` with the patch file downloaded in Step 1 above.
     3. Delete the `$JIRA_HOME/plugins/.bundled-plugins` directory.
     4. Restart JIRA.
   * JIRA WAR:
     1. Replace `$JIRA_WAR_INSTALL/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/atlassian-bundled-plugins.zip` with the patch file downloaded in Step 1 above.
     2. Regenerate the WAR file.
     3. Shut down JIRA.
     4. Install the new WAR you generated.
     5. Delete the `$JIRA_HOME/plugins/.bundled-plugins` directory.
     6. Restart JIRA.
3. Upgrade the following JIRA third-party plugins, if you are using them. The table below describes which version of the plugin you should upgrade to, depending on your JIRA version. See [Managing JIRA's Plugins](/jira/managing-add-ons-185729595.html) for instructions on how to upgrade a plugin. In general, you should upgrade these plugins to the latest available version compatible with your version of JIRA.

   | Plugin | JIRA 5.0 | JIRA 4.4 | JIRA 4.3 | JIRA 4.2 |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Gliffy plugin for JIRA | 3.7.1 | 3.7.1 | 3.7.1 | 3.7.1 |
   | Tempo | 7.0.3 | 6.5.0.2 | 6.4.3.1 | 6.4.3.1 |
4. Verify that patches succeeded by checking plugin versions. Versions of Tempo and Gliffy are listed in the table above. For the JIRA patch (step 1 above) you need to verify the version of Atlassian REST plugin.

   | Plugin | JIRA 4.4.5 | JIRA 4.3.4 | JIRA 4.2.4 | JIRA 4.1.2 |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Atlassian REST | 2.5.5.1 | 2.4.0.1 | 2.1.0.1 | 1.0.5.1 |

This advisory discloses a **critical** security vulnerability that exists in all versions of Confluence up to and including 4.1.9.

* **Customers** **who have downloaded and installed Confluence** should upgrade their existing Confluence installations to fix this vulnerability.
* **Enterprise Hosted customers** need to request an upgrade by raising a support request at [http://support.atlassian.com](http://support.atlassian.com/) in the "Enterprise Hosting Support" project.
* **JIRA Studio and Atlassian OnDemand customers** are not affected by any of the issues described in this advisory.

Atlassian is committed to improving product security. The vulnerability listed in this advisory has been discovered by Atlassian, unless noted otherwise. The reporter may also have requested that we do not credit them.

**In this advisory:**

## Critical XML Parsing Vulnerability

### Severity

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **crit****ical**, according to the scale published in [Severity Levels for Security Issues](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is an independent assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

### Description

We have identified and fixed a vulnerability in Confluence that results from the way third-party XML parsers are used in Confluence. This vulnerability allows an attacker to:

* execute denial of service attacks against the Confluence server, or
* read all local files readable to the system user under which Confluence runs.

The attacker does not need to have an account with the affected Confluence instance.

All versions of Confluence **up to and including 4.1.9** are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:
[CONF-25077](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONF-25077)
-
Getting issue details...
STATUS

The Gliffy for Confluence plugin is also vulnerable to this exploit. If you are using the Gliffy plugin for Confluence with *any* version of Confluence, you will need to upgrade it (see '[Fix](#ConfluenceSecurityAdvisory20120517-fix)' section below) or disable it.

### Risk Mitigation

We recommend that you upgrade your Confluence installation to fix this vulnerability.

Alternatively, if you are not in a position to upgrade immediately, you should do **all** of the following until you can upgrade. Please note, these measures will only limit the impact of the vulnerability, they will not mitigate it completely.

* Disable access to the SOAP and XML-RPC APIs, if these remote APIs are not required. Note, remote API access is disabled by default. See[enabling remote APIs](/doc/enabling-the-remote-api-150460.html) for instructions.
  Disable the following plugins/plugin modules (see [Disabling and enabling apps](/upm/disabling-and-enabling-apps-273875716.html)):
  + Office Connector plugin
  + JUnitReport macro module of the confluence-advanced-macros plugin (called "Advanced Macros" in the interface)
  + confluence-jira3-macros plugin (called "JIRA Macros" in the interface)
  + WebDAV
* Disable public access (such as[anonymous access](/doc/setting-up-public-access-156.html) and[public signup](/doc/add-and-invite-users-138313.html)) to Confluence until you have upgraded.
* Ensure that your Confluence system user is restricted as described in[best practices for configuring Confluence security](/doc/best-practices-for-configuring-confluence-security-216433533.html).

### Fix

**Upgrade**

1. Upgrade to Confluence 4.2 or later which fixes this vulnerability. For a full description of this release, see the [Confluence 4.2 Release Notes](/doc/confluence-4-2-release-notes-273286009.html). The following releases have also been made available to fix these issues in older Confluence versions.  You can download these versions of Confluence from the [download centre](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/ConfluenceDownloadCenter.jspa).

   * Confluence 4.1.10 for Confluence 4.1
   * Confluence 4.0.7 for Confluence 4.0
   * Confluence 3.5.17 for Confluence 3.5
2. Upgrade the following Confluence third-party plugins, if you are using them. The table below describes which version of the plugin you should upgrade to, depending on your Confluence version. See [Updating Add-ons](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Updating%2BAdd-ons) for instructions on how to update a plugin.

   | Plugin | Confluence 4.2 | Confluence 4.1 | Confluence 4.0 | Confluence 3.5 |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Gliffy plugin for Confluence | 4.2 | 4.2 | 4.2 | 4.2 |

**Patches**

There are no patches available for this vulnerability. Due to the extent of the changes required to fix the vulnerability, it is not possible to provide patches that resolve the issue without compromising the reliability of Confluence. You must upgrade to fix this vulnerability.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
