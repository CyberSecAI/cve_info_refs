      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Unvalidated Input",
       "Function pointer overwrite"

    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted, long command to the Script-Fu server"
    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable GIMP instance (if the network server is enabled). The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Script-Fu server component of GIMP and send a crafted message."

    "GIMP versions 2.6 and earlier (specifically <= 2.6.12)"

    "The vulnerability is present in both the script-fu console and the script-fu network server.",
    "The 2.6 branch of GIMP is no longer supported by the GIMP development team.",
    "The vulnerability is triggered when a long command is sent to the server, overwriting function pointers on the heap.",
    "A patch addressing this issue was created and applied to the gimp-2-6 branch of the repository, and the vulnerability was fixed in GIMP 2.8.0 and later versions.",
    "A workaround for vulnerable versions is to not use the script-fu server feature or use it within a secure/sandboxed environment."
