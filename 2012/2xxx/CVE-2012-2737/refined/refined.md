Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-2737:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition in how `accountsservice` (specifically the `accounts-daemon`) determines the user ID (UID) of a process making a D-Bus request, particularly when setting user icons using the `SetIconFile` method. The daemon was using PolicyKit to retrieve the UID from `/proc` "just in time", which was susceptible to a race condition. If the calling process quickly executed a `setuid` binary after initiating the request but before the UID was fetched, the daemon would incorrectly associate the action with the new, setuid user's UID instead of the original caller's UID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:** The primary weakness is a race condition, specifically a TOCTOU vulnerability. The program checks the caller's UID at one point in time, but uses it later, during which time the UID could have changed.
*   **Improper Privilege Handling:**  `accountsservice` runs with root privileges, and the vulnerable code attempts to impersonate the caller's user to copy the icon file. However, the flawed UID retrieval allows a malicious user to trick the system into performing this copy with incorrect privileges.
*   **Local File Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows a local attacker to read arbitrary files through the `SetIconFile` method, which was intended to copy user-supplied icon files to a local cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The most significant impact is the ability for a local attacker to read any file on the system that the `accountsservice` daemon has access to. This includes potentially sensitive files that the user should not normally have access to. This occurs when the `SetIconFile` method is called with path to arbitrary file, and due to the race condition, the file is copied to the cache folder using the permissions of the incorrect user. This copies the contents of the file, exposing them to the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is local. An attacker must have a user account on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **D-Bus Interface:** The attack is carried out by making a crafted D-Bus request to the `org.freedesktop.Accounts.User` interface, specifically targeting the `SetIconFile` method.
*   **SUID Binary Execution:**  The exploit relies on the ability to execute a setuid binary quickly after the initial D-Bus request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to Execute Binaries:** The attacker needs to be able to execute programs including `setuid` binaries.
*  **Ability to make D-Bus calls:** The attacker needs to be able to make calls to the D-Bus interface for `accountsservice`.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability is mitigated by changing the UID lookup logic. Instead of querying PolicyKit and `/proc` directly, the fix obtains the UID of the caller using cached peer credentials stored by the D-Bus daemon itself, which is obtained using  `GetConnectionUnixUser` method, which retrieves the UID of the user at the time the connection was initiated.  This method is used to obtain the UID for all other potentially vulnerable methods as well.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat.
*   The fix involves changes to the `src/util.c` and `src/user.c` files within the accountsservice codebase.
*   The fix was implemented in upstream commits, referenced with links in the provided content.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2012-2737, and associated Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-1485-1).
*  Ubuntu addressed this vulnerability in their 11.10 and 12.04 releases by upgrading the `accountsservice` package to versions 0.6.14-1git1ubuntu1.2 and 0.6.15-2ubuntu9.1 respectively.
