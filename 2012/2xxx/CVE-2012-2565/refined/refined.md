The provided content is related to CVE-2012-2565.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Bloxx administrative interface includes a backup function that saves configuration data, including administrator credentials, to a file. The administrator passwords are stored as SHA-1 hashes without salting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Storage of password hashes without salting.
- Inclusion of sensitive information, specifically user credentials in the backup file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with access to the backup file can extract the SHA-1 hashes of administrator passwords.
- Due to the lack of salting, these hashes can be cracked using rainbow tables, allowing the attacker to gain access to the administrator accounts.
- A malicious lower-level administrator with backup and restore rights can replace the password of a higher-level administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the backup file through malicious actions or unauthorized access.
- A malicious lower-level administrator with access to backup functionality can extract the password hashes or replace them.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs access to the Bloxx backup configuration files or the ability to use the backup functionality within the Bloxx Web Filtering management interface.
- For password replacement, a malicious lower-level administrator needs rights to backup and restore the configuration.
