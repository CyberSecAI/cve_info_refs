  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2012-2694": {
      "status": "Relevant",
      "details": {
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with how Rack parses query parameters. This allows an attacker to issue database queries with `IS NULL` in `WHERE` clauses.",
        "Weaknesses": "Unsafe query generation in rubygem-actionpack leading to unexpected database queries.",
        "Impact": "An attacker could bypass authentication in applications that use vulnerable versions of Ruby on Rails by crafting requests that cause the database to check for `NULL` values where it's not expected.",
        "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
      }
