Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2252:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an insufficient filtering mechanism within the `rssh` (restricted shell) utility when handling the `--rsh` command-line option of `rsync`.  `rssh` is intended to restrict the commands users can execute, specifically when using `scp/sftp, rdist, and cvs`. The vulnerability allows a malicious user to bypass these restrictions using the `--rsh` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** `rssh`'s command-line parsing failed to properly filter the `--rsh` option when specified as `--rsh` (without the `=` and a subsequent command). It only filtered out the `--rsh=command` format.
*   **Command Injection:** By exploiting the incomplete filtering of the `--rsh` option, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands to be executed by `rsync`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to bypass the restrictions imposed by `rssh` and execute arbitrary commands on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`rsync` with `--rsh` Option:** The attacker needs to use the `rsync` command, specifically invoking it with the `--rsh` option, bypassing the intended restrictions of `rssh`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have some form of access to the server where `rssh` is used, generally through `ssh`. They would need to be a user who is normally restricted by `rssh`.
*   **Knowledge of `rsync`:** The attacker needs to know that `rsync` can take a `--rsh` option and its implications.

**More Details than the CVE Description:**

*   The provided content specifies that the vulnerability exists because `rssh` incorrectly filtered the `--rsh` option, checking for `--rsh=` but not for `--rsh` alone.
*   The content also clarifies that this issue affects upstream code.
*   It mentions that the fix involves modifying the `check_command_line()` function in `util.c` to properly check for the presence of `--rsh`.
*   The content also includes a patch from Debian that updates the `rsync-protocol.diff` to correctly check for both `-e` and `--rsh` in `rsync_e_okay()`.
*   It further details that the rssh 2.3.4 release addresses this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

In summary, CVE-2012-2252 is a command injection vulnerability in the `rssh` utility caused by insufficient filtering of the `rsync` `--rsh` option.  This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands by bypassing the restrictions of the restricted shell.
