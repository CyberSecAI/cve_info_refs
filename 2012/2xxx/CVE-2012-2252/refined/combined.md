| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=880177#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-11-26 12:44:55 UTC  ``` It was discovered that rssh does not properly reject invocation of the rsync command with --rsh command line argument.  It rejected command if option was specified as --rsh=command, but not when specified as --rsh command.  The --rsh option makes rsync execute arbitrary command, resulting in bypass of the rssh restrictions.  This issue affects rssh packages in all current Fedora (16, 17) and EPEL (5, 6) versions.  Acknowledgement:  This issue was discovered by the Red Hat Security Response Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=880177#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2012-11-28 08:03:24 UTC  ``` Fixed now in upstream rssh 2.3.4.  <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=30153369> <http://www.debian.org/security/2012/dsa-2578>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=880177#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-11-28 08:28:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 653346](attachment.cgi?id=653346&action=diff "Updated rsync 3 patch from Debian") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=653346&action=edit "Updated rsync 3 patch from Debian") Updated rsync 3 patch from Debian  Source: <http://patch-tracker.debian.org/patch/series/view/rssh/2.3.3-6/fixes/rsync-protocol.diff>  Upstream fix for this issue replaced:    if ( strstr(*cl, "--rsh=" ) ){  check by a:    if ( strstr(*cl, "--rsh" ) ){  in check_command_line() in util.c.  In Fedora packages, where we already have a patch adding rsync 3 support, updated rsync-protocol.diff patch from Debian rssh packages should be considered instead (which checks both -e and --rsh in the rsync_e_okay()).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=880177#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-11-28 11:03:06 UTC  ``` Created rssh tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 880991](show_bug.cgi?id=880991 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-2252 rssh: incorrect filtering of rsync --rsh command line option [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 880992](show_bug.cgi?id=880992 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2252 rssh: incorrect filtering of rsync --rsh command line option [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=880177#c5)  Fedora Update System    2012-12-19 08:34:38 UTC  ``` rssh-2.3.4-1.fc17 has been pushed to the Fedora 17 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : rssh
Vulnerability  : insufficient filtering of rsync command line
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2251 CVE-2012-2252
Debian Bug     :

James Clawson discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for OpenSSH to be used
with scp/sftp, rdist and cvs, was not correctly filtering command line options.
This could be used to force the execution of a remote script and thus allow
arbitrary command execution. Two CVE were assigned:

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of command line when using rsync protocol. It was
	for example possible to pass dangerous options after a "--" switch. The rsync
	protocol support has been added in a Debian (and Fedora/Red Hat) specific
	patch, so this vulnerability doesn't affect upstream.

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of the "--rsh" option: the filter preventing usage of the
	"--rsh=" option would not prevent passing "--rsh". This vulnerability affects
	upstream code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.2-13squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.

Subject: rssh: incorrect filtering of command line options

Hi people,

I've just released DSA 2578-1 which affects rssh after coordination on
the distro list and I'm now posting to oss-sec per policy.

Package        : rssh
Vulnerability  : incorrect filtering of command line options
Problem type   : remote
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2251 CVE-2012-2252

James Clawson discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for OpenSSH to be used
with scp/sftp, rdist and cvs, was not correctly filtering command line options.
This could be used to force the execution of a remote script and thus allow
arbitrary command execution. Two CVE were assigned:

Yes, sorry for that, I reformated the advisory at the last minute and
did a wrong copy/paste…

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I believe this one was meant to be CVE-2012-2252...

I've uploaded rssh-2.3.4 to the project's web page, as well as to
sourceforge.  This update includes the fix for CVE-2012-2252, and also
rolls up a fix for CVE-2012-3478, for which I had previously only
posted a patch.  Additionally there are some mostly trivial updates
for code and build clean-up.
