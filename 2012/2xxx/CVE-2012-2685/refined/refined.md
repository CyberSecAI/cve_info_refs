  "CVE-2012-2685": {
    "description": "A denial of service condition was found in Cumin. Clients could request images of an arbitrary size, which would lead to large memory allocations on the server. This could lead to an out-of-memory condition, which could potentially consume all available memory on the Cumin server.",
    "vulnerability": "Denial of Service",
    "root_cause": "The Cumin server did not properly validate the size of requested images, allowing clients to request arbitrarily large images, which would lead to large memory allocations.",
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service on the Cumin server by exhausting its available memory.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can send specially crafted requests to the Cumin server requesting images of arbitrary size.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any privileges or credentials, they just need to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
