Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-2529:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is due to the Windows kernel improperly handling objects in memory. Specifically, it is an integer overflow issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow vulnerability within the Windows kernel's memory management. This can lead to unexpected behavior when the kernel tries to allocate or manipulate memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Full System Control:**  An attacker can then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights. In other words, they can gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system. They must be able to execute code on the target machine.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker must run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the integer overflow vulnerability in the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid user credentials to access the system locally.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to run a specially crafted executable or program on the target machine.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The vulnerability affects a range of Windows operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Microsoft.
*   The fix involves correcting the way the Windows kernel handles objects in memory.
*   Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability when the security bulletin was released.
*   The Microsoft Exploitability Index rated this as "Exploitation More Likely".
