{
  "CVE-2012-2669": {
    "Description": "The main function in tools/hv/hv_kvp_daemon.c in hypervkvpd, as distributed in the Linux kernel before 3.4.5, does not validate the origin of Netlink messages, which allows local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted connector message.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The hypervkvpd daemon does not validate the origin of Netlink messages, allowing spoofing by local users.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Lack of origin validation for Netlink messages",
	  "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Local users can spoof Netlink communication via crafted messages, potentially leading to a denial of service by causing the daemon to exit.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted Netlink messages sent from a local user.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access."
