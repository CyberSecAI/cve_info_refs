Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2750 CVE-2013-3839

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=833742#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-06-20 08:41:16 UTC  ``` MySQL version 5.5.23 releases notes mention following security fix:   * Security Fix: [Bug #59533](show_bug.cgi?id=59533 "CLOSED NOTABUG - Anaconda is unable to detect hard disk partitions") was fixed.   <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/news-5-5-23.html>  Upstream bug is currently private and there's no additional info currently available for this issue.  The bug is not referenced by any commit in the upstream bazaar repositories.    <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=59533>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=833742#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-07-25 08:31:40 UTC  ``` There's still no information available for this issue even after the released of Oracle July 2012 CPU:   <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujul2012-392727.html>  Of the CVEs listed in the CPU, there's only one listed as fixed in 5.5.23:    [CVE-2012-1689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1689)  Server Optimizer  4.0/AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P+  [CVE-2012-1689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1689) is also listed to affected 5.1 before 5.1.63.  We currently have no way to know if [CVE-2012-1689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1689) is a duplicate of [CVE-2012-2750](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2750), whether [CVE-2012-1689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1689) was used to refer to more than one issue, or whether it's completely different issue and [CVE-2012-2750](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2750) is not covered by upstream CPU at all.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=833742#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-03 09:44:35 UTC  ``` [CVE-2012-1689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1689) has separate [bug #841351](show_bug.cgi?id=841351 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1689 mysql: unspecified DoS vulnerability related to Server Optimizer (CPU Jul 2012)").   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=833742#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-31 13:57:30 UTC  ``` As noted in [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=833742#c1), this is most likely a duplicate or subset of other CVE listed in Oracle July 2012 CPU.  However, Oracle refused to provide any additional details on the CVE, even limited to confirming which ids are duplicates.  Closing, as this can not be addressed.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=833742#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-10-16 18:29:41 UTC  ``` This is noted in the Oracle October 2013 CPU:  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuoct2013-1899837.html#AppendixMSQL>  and is noted as affecting the Optimizer sub-component.  As a result, I do not believe this is a duplicate (although, arguably, there's not much more information here than we had to begin with).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=833742#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2013-12-11 13:06:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=833742#c4)) > This is noted in the Oracle October 2013 CPU: >  > <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuoct2013-1899837.html#AppendixMSQL> >  > and is noted as affecting the Optimizer sub-component.  Note that the info in October 2013 CPU does not contradict info noted in [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=833742#c1) in any way:  - both [CVE-2012-1689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1689) and [CVE-2012-2750](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2750) are listed as affecting Optimizer component - both ids have the same CVSS score and vector - both are listed as fixed in 5.5.23 (i.e. long before Oct CPU 2013) - there is no fixed in version for 5.1 listed for [CVE-2012-2750](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2750)  > As a result, I do not believe this is a duplicate (although, arguably, > there's not much more information here than we had to begin with).  Listing of [CVE-2012-2750](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2750) in Oct CPU 2013 may well be an attempt to stop queries they get regarding the MySQL CVE that was not listed in any previous CPU without providing any useful information (e.g. by confirming relationship to [CVE-2012-1689](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1689)).  MySQL 5.5 shipped in Red Hat products - mysql55-mysql in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and Red Hat Software Collections 1, are based on newer upstream MySQL versions (5.5.32 currently) and hence should have both CVEs fixed.  There's insufficient information available to know if MySQL 5.1 is fixed an in what version.   ``` |  |
