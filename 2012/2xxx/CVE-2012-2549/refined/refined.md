Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-2549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the IP-HTTPS component of Microsoft Windows handles certificates. Specifically, Windows fails to properly validate the revocation status of certificates presented to an IP-HTTPS server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the inadequate checking of certificate validity by the IP-HTTPS component, particularly regarding revoked certificates. This allows a revoked certificate to be used as if it were valid.
- **Security Feature Bypass:** By using a revoked certificate, an attacker can bypass security features that rely on proper certificate validation, gaining unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** The primary impact is that an attacker can bypass certificate validation checks, which are a crucial part of secure communication.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access:** While the vulnerability itself does not grant direct access to a system, it can allow an attacker to circumvent the authentication measures that rely on certificate validity. Logging into systems inside the network still requires valid system or domain credentials, so this doesn't give direct system access. It allows access to resources the valid certificate would grant through the IP-HTTPS tunnel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to present a revoked certificate to an IP-HTTPS server.
- The attacker has to acquire a certificate that was issued from the domain that would be trusted by the IP-HTTPS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Domain-Issued Certificate:** The attacker must possess a certificate that was issued from the domain being targeted by the IP-HTTPS server.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to present the revoked certificate to the IP-HTTPS server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2012.
- The vulnerability is related to IP-HTTPS, which is commonly used in Microsoft DirectAccess deployments.
- The provided documents confirm that Microsoft was not aware of active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of publishing the security update.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index for this vulnerability at the time was not specified.
- A workaround was mentioned - disabling the domain computer accounts associated with revoked client certificates.
