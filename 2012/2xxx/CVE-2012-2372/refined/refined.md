  "CVE-2012-2372": {
    "description": "Attempting an rds connection from the IP address of an IPoIB interface to itself causes a kernel panic due to a BUG_ON() being triggered. Making the test less strict allows rds-ping to work without crashing the machine. A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the sytem.",
    "root_cause": "A BUG_ON() was triggered when an RDS connection was attempted from the IP address of an IPoIB interface to itself.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper check for loopback connections in the RDS protocol implementation.",
       "Unrestricted access to cause a kernel panic."
    ],
    "impact": "A local unprivileged user can cause a kernel panic (denial of service).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by attempting to connect via RDS from an IPoIB interface to the same IP address. "
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local unprivileged user access.",
