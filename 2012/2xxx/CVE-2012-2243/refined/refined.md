{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-2243",
    "description": "Reflected XSS in user/group bulk CSV upload",
    "root_cause": "The application displays error messages from pieform based on user-provided data without sanitization. Specifically, if the CSV header in a bulk user/group upload contains unknown fields, these fields are displayed as part of an error message without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the error message, which will then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
     "attack_vector": "The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted CSV file with malicious content in the header fields, and then uploading the file via the bulk user/group upload functionality. When the application processes this file and encounters unknown header fields, it will display the attacker's malicious content as part of the error message.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to upload a CSV file via the bulk upload feature of the application. This typically requires having an authenticated user account, although the exact user role needed to perform the upload is not explicitly mentioned."
  },
    "additional_details":{
        "affected_versions": "Affects versions at least back to 1.2, and was fixed in versions 1.4.5, 1.5.4, and 1.6.0"
