Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `xfs_metadump` tool in xfsprogs did not properly obfuscate file data. While it obfuscated active metadata, the remaining space within a filesystem block was left in the clear. This resulted in the potential exposure of stale disk data in the metadump image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unintended disclosure of potentially sensitive data that should have been obfuscated.
*   **Incomplete Obfuscation:** The tool failed to obfuscate all data within a filesystem block, contrary to its stated purpose. The man page specifies that most file names and extended attribute names should be obfuscated, with the exception of very short names or those spanning extents but this was not fully implemented.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** Attackers or unauthorized parties could gain access to sensitive information, including file names and contents of stale data residing in the unused parts of the filesystem block. This could include residual data from deleted files or previous operations.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The unintended exposure of such data constitutes a violation of privacy, as users might rely on the tool to obfuscate sensitive details before sharing metadump images.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** While `xfs_metadump` can be run by unprivileged users, they require access to the block devices of the filesystem. Therefore, the vulnerability could be exploited by a local user with the necessary access.
*   **Metadump Sharing:** Users might generate a metadump image and then share it with third parties for debugging or other purposes. If not fully obfuscated, these images could leak sensitive information when shared with untrusted parties.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Block Device:** The attacker needs the ability to access the block device of the filesystem, usually requiring root or administrative privileges.
*   **Ability to Run xfs\_metadump:**  The attacker must be able to execute the `xfs_metadump` command on the targeted filesystem.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** While not strictly required, an attacker would need to be aware that the tool is not fully obfuscating the metadump.
