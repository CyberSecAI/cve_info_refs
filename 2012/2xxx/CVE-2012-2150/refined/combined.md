| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=817696#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-30 22:55:45 UTC  ``` Gabriel Vlasiu reported that xfs_metadump, part of the xfsprogs suite of tools for the XFS filesystem, did not properly obfuscate data.  xfs_metadump properly obfuscates active metadata, but the rest of the space within that fs block comes through in the clear.  This could lead to exposure of stale disk data via the produced metadump image.  The expectation of xfs_metadump is to obfuscate all but the shortest names in the metadata, as noted in the manpage:  By  default,  xfs_metadump  obfuscates  most  file (regular file, directory and symbolic link) names and extended  attribute  names to  allow  the  dumps  to be sent without revealing confidential information. Extended attribute values are zeroed and no data  is copied.  The only exceptions are file or attribute names that are 4 or less characters in length. Also file names that span extents (this can only occur with the mkfs.xfs(8) options where -n size > -b size) are not obfuscated.  Names between 5 and 8 characters  in length inclusively are partially obfuscated.  While the xfs_metadump tool can be run by unprivileged users, it requires appropriate permissions to access block devices (such as root) where the sensitive data might be dumped.  An unprivileged user, without access to the block device, could not use this flaw to obtain sensitive data they would not otherwise have permission to access.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=817696#c16)  Kurt Seifried    2015-07-23 14:39:18 UTC  ``` Upstream patches will be available at  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/fs/xfs/xfsprogs-dev.git/>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=817696#c17)  Tomas Hoger    2015-08-04 08:30:22 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in xfsprogs v3.2.4:  <http://oss.sgi.com/pipermail/xfs/2015-July/042726.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=817696#c18)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-08-04 09:43:42 UTC  ``` This issue is not about local users being able to access restricted data via xfs metadumps. In order to be able to generate such a dump, local users need to have the appropriate access permissions to the block device, so this does not cross any security boundaries in that regard.  This issue is about users generating a metadump image via xfs_metadump and then sharing it with 3rd parties (for example for debugging purposes), relying on the xfs_metadump functionality to obfuscate potentially sensitive details. This obfuscation functionality did not work as advertised in the manpage, thus it may be possible that sensitive information is leaked as part of the metadata dump.  If in doubt, do not share xfs_metadump dumps with untrusted 3rd parties.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=817696#c26)  Fedora Update System    2015-08-12 07:02:20 UTC  ``` xfsprogs-3.2.2-2.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.

I have just released xfsprogs v3.2.4 to address these issues. Please
see the release announcement here for details on where to find it:

<http://oss.sgi.com/pipermail/xfs/2015-July/042726.html>

-Dave.

PS: A comment on the CVE disclosure process: please ensure that the
upstream maintainer is informed of the CVE and the public disclosure
plan *before* disclosure occurs.  Apart from preventing co-ordinated
release of the fixes, failing to inform the maintainer of the
problem before public disclosure is impolite and disrespectful.

Message-ID: <55B0FD01.1080602@redhat.com>
Date: Thu, 23 Jul 2015 08:41:05 -0600
From: Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE-2012-2150 xfsprogs: xfs_metadump information disclosure flaw

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=817696>

Gabriel Vlasiu reported that xfs_metadump, part of the xfsprogs suite of
tools for the XFS filesystem, did not properly obfuscate data.
xfs_metadump properly obfuscates active metadata, but the rest of the
space within that fs block comes through in the clear.  This could lead
to exposure of stale disk data via the produced metadump image.

The expectation of xfs_metadump is to obfuscate all but the shortest
names in the metadata, as noted in the manpage:

By  default,  xfs_metadump  obfuscates  most  file (regular file,
directory and symbolic link) names and extended  attribute  names to
allow  the  dumps  to be sent without revealing confidential
information. Extended attribute values are zeroed and no data  is
copied.  The only exceptions are file or attribute names that are 4 or
less characters in length. Also file names that span extents (this can
only occur with the mkfs.xfs(8) options where -n size > -b size) are not
obfuscated.  Names between 5 and 8 characters  in length
inclusively are partially obfuscated.

While the xfs_metadump tool can be run by unprivileged users, it
requires appropriate permissions to access block devices (such as root)
where the sensitive data might be dumped.  An unprivileged user, without
access to the block device, could not use this flaw to obtain sensitive
data they would not otherwise have permission to access.

Upstream patches will be available at
<https://git.kernel.org/cgit/fs/xfs/xfsprogs-dev.git/>

For details please see the RH bug, currently not fix available as far as I can see  References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=817696> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/181> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-2150> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2150> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-07-24 21:59:44 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c2)  Johannes Segitz   2015-07-30 09:29:45 UTC  ``` New upstream release that fixes the issue  <http://oss.sgi.com/pipermail/xfs/2015-July/042726.html> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c3)  Jan Kara   2015-07-31 10:49:30 UTC  ``` Ok, I've pushed the package to "filesystems" repo and factory. I'll be working on backporting the fixes to older codestreams. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c4)  Jan Kara   2015-08-11 16:20:27 UTC  ``` So I have patches ported to SLE12 (that was easy) and can submit it when needed. I have also ported patches to SLE11 SP2 codebase (used also for SP3 and SP4 in case of xfsprogs). But they don't fix the issue completely because the version of xfs_metadump used for SLE11 SP2 doesn't have the ability to properly iterate multi-block directories.  So how hard do we want to try to fix this? There are three options I can see: 1) Just ignore the problem for anything older than SLE12. 2) Use backported patches so some (but not all) of the exposed data are properly obfuscated. 3) Port other work on xfs_metadump so that obfuscation can work properly in all the cases.  IMHO the threat here (exposure of filenames, parts of old xattrs if we go for 1) isn't big here and if the customer is sending us metadump he has a contract with us anyway so it shouldn't be a big concern. So the risk and effort to backport more features into metadump is outweighting the gain... But I wanted to consult this with the security team... Guys, what's your opinion? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c5)  Johannes Segitz   2015-08-12 07:25:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jan Kara from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c4)) I would opt for 2. It there a place where we can add a warning to the user which data still gets exposed after the patch? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c6)  Jan Kara   2015-08-12 07:39:56 UTC  ``` We can comment on it in the manpage, I'll add that. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c7)  Jan Kara   2015-08-12 09:03:36 UTC  ``` OK, so the manpage already has a comment about this so there's nothing more to add. I'll push patches I have once I finish the final round of testing. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c8)  Jan Kara   2015-08-12 13:30:20 UTC  ``` OK, I have update for SLE11 SP2 (SP3, SP4) prepared as well. I have spent a couple of hours trying to backport fixes further to SLE11 SP1 but it gets even messier and so far patches still corrupt images so I'm inclined to just don't fix the problem in xfsprogs in SLE11 SP1 and older since in my opinion it's not worth the effort...  I'll have a look at openSUSE now. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c9)  Jan Kara   2015-08-12 13:52:12 UTC  ``` OK, openSUSE is done. So to summarize: I have prepared updates for openSUSE-13.1, openSUSE-13.2, SLE12, SLE11-SP2 (used for SP3 & SP4 as well) which is all I can do with reasonable effort. Please let me know when I should submit packages. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c10)  Marcus Meissner   2015-08-13 15:07:00 UTC  ``` please submit, we can accept and not yet put them to QA.  seperate submits. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c12)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2015-08-14 08:00:12 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (939367) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/322851> 13.2+13.1 / xfsprogs ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c13)  Jan Kara   2015-08-14 08:18:56 UTC  ``` Submitted for SLE12 as request 65392.

I've created it there with osc mbranch which then created only one request for both openSUSE versions. I hope it's fine. If not, I can redo the submit for openSUSE. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c14)  Andreas Stieger   2015-08-14 08:23:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jan Kara from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=939367#c13)) > Submitted for openSUSE 13.1 and 13.2 as request 322851.
