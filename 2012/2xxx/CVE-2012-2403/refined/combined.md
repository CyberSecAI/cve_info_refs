Debian Bug     : 670124

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool.  As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead
of backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2+dfsg-1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# WordPress 3.3.2 (and WordPress 3.4 Beta 3)

---

[WordPress 3.3.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) is available now and is a security update for all previous versions.

Three external libraries included in WordPress received security updates:

* Plupload (version 1.5.4), which WordPress uses for uploading media.
* SWFUpload, which WordPress previously used for uploading media, and may still be in use by plugins.
* SWFObject, which WordPress previously used to embed Flash content, and may still be in use by plugins and themes.

Thanks to [Neal Poole](https://nealpoole.com/blog/) and [Nathan Partlan](http://greywhind.wordpress.com/) for [responsibly disclosing](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security) the bugs in Plupload and SWFUpload, and [Szymon Gruszecki](http://mars.iti.pk.edu.pl/~grucha/) for a separate bug in SWFUpload.

WordPress 3.3.2 also addresses:

* Limited privilege escalation where a site administrator could deactivate network-wide plugins when running a WordPress network under particular circumstances, disclosed by [Jon Cave](http://joncave.co.uk/) of our WordPress core security team, and [Adam Backstrom](http://sixohthree.com/).
* Cross-site scripting vulnerability when making URLs clickable, by Jon Cave.
* Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in redirects after posting comments in older browsers, and when filtering URLs. Thanks to [Mauro Gentile](http://www.sneaked.net/) for responsibly disclosing these issues to the security team.

These issues were fixed by the WordPress core security team. Five other bugs were also fixed in version 3.3.2. Consult the [change log](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.3?rev=20552&stop_rev=20087) for more details.

[Download WordPress 3.3.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) or update now from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

---

### WordPress 3.4 Beta 3 also available

Our development of WordPress 3.4 development continues. Today we are proud to release Beta 3 for testing. [Nearly 90 changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk?rev=20552&stop_rev=20450) have been made since Beta 2, released 9 days ago. (We are aiming for a beta every week.)

This is still beta software, so **we don’t recommend that you use it on production sites**. But if you’re a plugin developer, a theme developer, or a site administrator, **you should be running this on your test environments** and [reporting any bugs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs) you find. (See the [known issues here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5).) If you’re a WordPress user who wants to open your presents early, take advantage of WordPress’s famous 5-minute install and spin up a secondary test site. [Let us know what you think](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta)!

Version 3.4 Beta 3 includes all of the fixes included in version 3.3.2. [Download WordPress 3.4 Beta 3](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.4-beta3.zip) or use the [WordPress Beta Tester](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) plugin.

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
