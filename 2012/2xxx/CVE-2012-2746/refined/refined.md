  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-2746",
    "description": "It was found that when the password for an LDAP user was changed, and audit logging was enabled (it is disabled by default), the new password was written to the audit log in plain text form. This update introduces a new configuration parameter, \"nsslapd-auditlog-logging-hide-unhashed-pw\", which when set to \"on\" (the default option), prevents Red Hat Directory Server from writing plain text passwords to the audit log.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Directory Server 8",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6",
      "389 Directory Server"
    ],
    "root_cause": "When a user changes their password, the new password is written to the audit log in plaintext.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Plaintext password logging"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of user passwords in the audit log.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker who has access to the audit log files could read user passwords in cleartext."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Access to the directory server's audit log files."
    ],
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is addressed by a configuration parameter 'nsslapd-auditlog-logging-hide-unhashed-pw'. This parameter defaults to 'on', preventing the logging of passwords in clear text. The audit log is located in the directory server log directory `/var/log/dirsrv/slapd-[hostname]` with default permissions of mode 0600 owned by the directory server user."
