Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-2496:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client contains an arbitrary code execution vulnerability. This vulnerability is specifically related to the 64-bit Java applet used for the WebLaunch VPN downloader functionality.
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the Java applet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The Java applet does not properly validate user-supplied input, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Unsigned Java Applet:** The affected 64-bit Java applet is not cryptographically signed by Cisco, making it easier for an attacker to substitute it with a malicious version.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user's web browser session on the targeted system. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain control over the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** The attacker must convince a user to visit a malicious web page.
*   **Malicious Java Applet:** The attacker supplies a malicious or modified version of the vulnerable Java applet to be executed on the victim's system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to visit a malicious website that serves the malicious Java applet.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the 64-bit Java applet used in the WebLaunch component of Cisco AnyConnect.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by removing the unsigned Java applet in AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 3.0 MR7 (3.0.7059) for 64-bit Linux.
*   The vulnerability affects versions prior to 3.0 MR7 when running on Linux 64-bit systems.
*   The provided CVSS score is Base 6.8, Temporal 5.6. The vector is AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C
*   The vulnerability is tracked under Cisco Bug ID CSCty45925.
*   Microsoft and Oracle provided mitigations to block the vulnerable code.
