    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `dotest()` function within the `src/pkg/debug/gosym/pclntab_test.go` file of Golang version 1.0.1. This function creates a temporary file with a predictable name and executes it as a shell script.",
      "weaknesses": "The use of a predictable temporary file name and executing it as a shell script introduces a security risk. This is a classic insecure temporary file handling vulnerability.",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, with a low attack complexity, requiring no privileges or user interaction.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the system with the vulnerable component. No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned."
