Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-2106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `pv_import` utility of `csound5`, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in how `pv_import` handles specially crafted CSV files.
- An integer overflow occurs when calculating the memory needed for a buffer.
- This leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when data is copied into the undersized buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Application crash
- Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running `pv_import`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs when a user opens a specially crafted CSV file using the `pv_import` utility.
- This requires the user to be tricked into opening the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious CSV file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the file with the vulnerable `pv_import` utility.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed with two patches, as the initial fix was incomplete.
- The issue was present in `csound5`.
- openSUSE and Fedora were affected.
