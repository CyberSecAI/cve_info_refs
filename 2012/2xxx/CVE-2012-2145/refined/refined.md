{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2012-2145",
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way that qpidd handled incoming connections. If a client application were to send a large number of connections to qpidd, without terminating the connections with an incomplete handshake, qpidd would keep a file descriptor open for each connection. This could lead to excessive resource consumption by qpidd and could also block other legitimate connection requests.",
    "affected_components": [
      "qpidd"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Qpid daemon (qpidd) did not properly handle incomplete connections, failing to close file descriptors associated with these connections, leading to resource exhaustion.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious client can send a large number of incomplete connection requests to the qpidd server."
     ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Resource exhaustion due to improper handling of incomplete connections."
    ],
    "impact": "A denial-of-service (DoS) attack can be triggered by exhausting system resources, making the server unresponsive to legitimate connection requests.",
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker must be able to establish network connections to the qpidd service port."
    ],
    "additional_information": [
      "The issue is corrected by introducing configuration options in qpidd like 'max-negotiate-time', 'connection-limit-per-user', and 'connection-limit-per-ip'."
