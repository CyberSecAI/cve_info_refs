How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-27 22:18:21 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way that qpidd handled incoming connections.  If a client application were to send a large number of connections to qpidd, without terminating the connections with an incomplete handshake, qpidd would keep a file descriptor open for each connection.  This could lead to excessive resource consumption by qpidd and could also block other legitimate connection requests.  This flaw has also been reported upstream:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-2616> (RFE for disconnecting clients on incomplete handshakes)  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4021> (the actual flaw)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-09 14:39:49 UTC  ``` To work-around this issue, you can use the iptables connlimit feature to the qpid broker port so that any IP/Host gets a limited number of connections:  /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport $brokerPort -m connlimit --connlimit-above N -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c3)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-09 14:41:18 UTC  ``` Created qpid-cpp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 820298](show_bug.cgi?id=820298 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-2145 qpid-cpp: not closing incomplete connections exhausts file descriptors, leading to DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-25 19:57:16 UTC  ``` This is corrected in upstream svn:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1341263>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-28 18:15:58 UTC  ``` Sorry, it was _partially_ corrected upstream.  See QPID-4021 (<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4021>) where it notes that the default timeout still leaves a gap for where a misbehaving client can tie up the broker.  This has not yet been corrected upstream.  As well, the commit noted in #c5 is the second third of the fix, the first third is:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1341262>  We are still waiting for the fix to fully resolve the flaw (QPID-4021).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-16 15:44:24 UTC  ``` Additional related commits:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1331549> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1332788>  which add per-user and per-IP connection limits (acl-max-connect-per-user and acl-max-connect-per-ip).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:21:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1277 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1277.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:30:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1269 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1269.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c11)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 19:51:32 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1269)

## Topic

Updated qpid packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and add
various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Apache Qpid is a reliable, cross-platform, asynchronous messaging system
that supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) in several
common programming languages.

It was discovered that the Qpid daemon (qpidd) did not allow the number of
connections from clients to be restricted. A malicious client could use
this flaw to open an excessive amount of connections, preventing other
legitimate clients from establishing a connection to qpidd. (CVE-2012-2145)

To address CVE-2012-2145, new qpidd configuration options were introduced:
max-negotiate-time defines the time during which initial protocol
negotiation must succeed, connection-limit-per-user and
connection-limit-per-ip can be used to limit the number of connections per
user and client host IP. Refer to the qpidd manual page for additional
details.

In addition, the qpid-cpp, qpid-qmf, qpid-tools, and python-qpid packages
have been upgraded to upstream version 0.14, which provides support for Red
Hat Enterprise MRG 2.2, as well as a number of bug fixes and enhancements
over the previous version. (BZ#840053, BZ#840055, BZ#840056, BZ#840058)

All users of qpid are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
fix these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=841488#c0)  Leonid Zhaldybin    2012-07-19 07:11:24 UTC  ``` Description of problem: qpid-config tool is perfectly capable of creating queues, exchanges and binding keys containing multi-byte characters (I tried Czech diacritical marks and Cyrillic letters). But qpid-stat tool is unable to show any statistics if such characters are used:  [root@lzhaldyb-rhel63x ~]# qpid-config add queue ěáéčáš [root@lzhaldyb-rhel63x ~]# qpid-config queues Queue Name                           Attributes ============================================================ qmfc-v2-hb-lzhaldyb-rhel63x.11765.1  auto-del excl --limit-policy=ring  qmfc-v2-lzhaldyb-rhel63x.11765.1     auto-del excl  qmfc-v2-ui-lzhaldyb-rhel63x.11765.1  auto-del excl --limit-policy=ring  reply-lzhaldyb-rhel63x.11765.1       auto-del excl  topic-lzhaldyb-rhel63x.11765.1       auto-del excl --limit-policy=ring  ěáéčáš                          [root@lzhaldyb-rhel63x ~]# qpid-stat -q Queues Failed: UnicodeDecodeError - 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc4 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): qpid-tools-0.14-4.el6_3.noarch qpid-tools-0.14-3.el5  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Using qpid-config, create a queue or an exchange with mulit-byte characters in the name. 2. Try to get statistics from the broker by running qpid-stat tool. 3.    Actual results: qpid-stat returns an error and is unable to report any statistics.  Expected results: qpid-stat is able to show statistics for queues and exchanges containing UTF-8 characters.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=841488#c1)  Ted Ross    2012-07-20 15:05:40 UTC  ``` Fix committed on trunk at revision 1363795.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=841488#c4)  Leonid Zhaldybin    2012-08-02 08:31:28 UTC  ``` Tested on the latest available MRG/M 2.2 build on RHEL58 and RHEL6.3 (both i386 and x86_64).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-27 22:18:21 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way that qpidd handled incoming connections.  If a client application were to send a large number of connections to qpidd, without terminating the connections with an incomplete handshake, qpidd would keep a file descriptor open for each connection.  This could lead to excessive resource consumption by qpidd and could also block other legitimate connection requests.  This flaw has also been reported upstream:  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-2616> (RFE for disconnecting clients on incomplete handshakes)  <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4021> (the actual flaw)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-09 14:39:49 UTC  ``` To work-around this issue, you can use the iptables connlimit feature to the qpid broker port so that any IP/Host gets a limited number of connections:  /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport $brokerPort -m connlimit --connlimit-above N -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c3)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-09 14:41:18 UTC  ``` Created qpid-cpp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 820298](show_bug.cgi?id=820298 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-2145 qpid-cpp: not closing incomplete connections exhausts file descriptors, leading to DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-25 19:57:16 UTC  ``` This is corrected in upstream svn:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1341263>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-28 18:15:58 UTC  ``` Sorry, it was _partially_ corrected upstream.  See QPID-4021 (<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4021>) where it notes that the default timeout still leaves a gap for where a misbehaving client can tie up the broker.  This has not yet been corrected upstream.  As well, the commit noted in #c5 is the second third of the fix, the first third is:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1341262>  We are still waiting for the fix to fully resolve the flaw (QPID-4021).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-16 15:44:24 UTC  ``` Additional related commits:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1331549> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1332788>  which add per-user and per-IP connection limits (acl-max-connect-per-user and acl-max-connect-per-ip).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:21:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1277 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1277.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:30:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1269 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1269.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=817175#c11)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 19:51:32 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ``` |  |

#### Description

The recent code that timeouts out new connections that have not negotiated the protocol within (a default) 2 seconds still leaves a gap where badly behaved applications can tie up the broker.

The timeout should really be till either heartbeats are activated in which case they will take over the role of timing out idle connections. Or until the connection is authenticated in which case the policy on admitting users should take care of limiting the connections.

  Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.2
#### Description

The broker should disconnect clients if the connection handshake doesn't complete after a configurable time (both for SSL and for non-SSL connections).

This feature has already been mentioned by G. Sim in the JIRA [~~QPID-2518~~](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-2518 "Qpid C++ broker can easily be blocked by client trying to connect over SSL port").

We are looking for an implementation of this feature and will provide it as soon as we are done.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=836276#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-28 14:35:38 UTC  ``` In the AMQP messaging scheme implementation each broker can have both, direct connections and shadow connections. A shadow connection represents a connection to another broker in the cluster. Members use shadow connections to simulate the actions of other brokers, so that all members arrive at the same time. Output for shadow connections is just discarded, brokers only send data to their directly-connected clients.  A security flaw was found in the way the Apache Qpid C++ implementation performed authentication of connections creating "catch-up" shadow connections, which are used when broker joins the cluster. An AMQP client could use this to fake shadow connections to the AMQP broker. This issue was caused by using NullAuthenticator mechanism for authenticating these "catch-up" shadow connection and was fixed by making broker require authentication.  Upstream ticket: [1] <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-3849>  Relevant upstream patch: [2] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1352992>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=836276#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:21:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1277 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1277.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=836276#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:30:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1279 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1279.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1277)

## Topic

Updated Messaging component packages that fix two security issues, multiple
bugs, and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
MRG 2.2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

MRG Messaging is a high-speed reliable messaging distribution for Linux
based on AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open protocol
standard for enterprise messaging that is designed to make mission critical
messaging widely available as a standard service, and to make enterprise
messaging interoperable across platforms, programming languages, and
vendors. MRG Messaging includes an AMQP 0-10 messaging broker; AMQP 0-10
client libraries for C++, Java JMS, and Python; as well as persistence
libraries and management tools.

It was discovered that the Apache Qpid daemon (qpidd) did not allow the
number of connections from clients to be restricted. A malicious client
could use this flaw to open an excessive amount of connections, preventing
other legitimate clients from establishing a connection to qpidd.
(CVE-2012-2145)

To address CVE-2012-2145, new qpidd configuration options were introduced:
max-negotiate-time defines the time during which initial protocol
negotiation must succeed, connection-limit-per-user and
connection-limit-per-ip can be used to limit the number of connections per
user and client host IP. Refer to the qpidd manual page for additional
details.

It was discovered that qpidd did not require authentication for "catch-up"
shadow connections created when a new broker joins a cluster. A malicious
client could use this flaw to bypass client authentication. (CVE-2012-3467)

This update also fixes multiple bugs and adds enhancements. Documentation
for these changes will be available shortly from the Technical Notes
document linked to in the References section.

All users of the Messaging capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.2 are
advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and
add the enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes.
After installing the updated packages, stop the cluster by either running
"service qpidd stop" on all nodes, or "qpid-cluster --all-stop" on any one
of the cluster nodes. Once stopped, restart the cluster with "service qpidd
start" on all nodes for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.
