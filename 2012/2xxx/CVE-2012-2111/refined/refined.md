Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-2111:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Samba handles Local Security Authority (LSA) Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs). Specifically, the CreateAccount, OpenAccount, AddAccountRights, and RemoveAccountRights RPC calls were not adequately checking permissions.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper permission checks within the Samba server's code when processing LSA RPCs related to account privileges. This allowed users to make changes they should not have been authorized to make.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A remote, authenticated attacker could exploit this flaw to grant themselves administrative privileges on the Samba server.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** With these escalated privileges, an attacker could:
    *   Take ownership of arbitrary files and directories shared by the Samba server, which are not under their control.
    *   Create, delete, and modify user accounts.
    *   Perform other administrative tasks on the Samba server.
*   **Data compromise:** Attackers could steal other users' data without authorization.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability could be exploited remotely, requiring network access to the Samba server.
*   **Authenticated Attacker:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Samba server, but they do not need any prior special privileges beyond a valid user account.
*   **LSA RPC Manipulation:** The exploit involves making specifically crafted LSA RPC calls that bypass the insufficient permission checks.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Samba server over the network.
*   **Valid Credentials:**  A valid username and password for an account on the Samba server.
*   **Understanding of LSA RPC:** The attacker must be able to construct malicious RPCs to exploit the insufficient permission check vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affected multiple versions of Samba, including 3.4.x, 3.5.x and 3.6.x. The vulnerability also affected Samba3x.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by patching the code to implement stricter permission checks on the LSA RPC calls.
