Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An out-of-bounds read error exists in the Broadcom BCM4325 and BCM4329 wireless chipset firmware's handling of 802.11i information elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The firmware reads data beyond the allocated buffer when processing 802.11i information elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack can cause the Wi-Fi network interface card to stop responding, leading to a temporary disablement of Wi-Fi connectivity. On Apple TV, it can cause an unexpected system termination.
*   **Potential Information Disclosure:** The CORE Security advisory mentions "possibly information disclosure" but the provided details mainly focus on denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker on the same Wi-Fi network can send specially crafted 802.11i information elements to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the vulnerable device.
*   **Ability to Inject Packets:** The attacker must be able to send custom 802.11i information elements.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects devices using Broadcom BCM4325 and BCM4329 chipsets.
*   Apple addressed the issue in iOS 6.1 and Apple TV 5.2 by implementing additional validation of 802.11i information elements.
*   The CERT/CC vulnerability note lists multiple vendors, including Apple, Broadcom, HTC, with varying degrees of response.
*   The vulnerability is specific to the firmware of the affected Broadcom chips, not the software or OS that uses the chip.

This information is more detailed than a simple CVE description, it includes the specific vulnerable chipsets, the attack vector, and the fix information from Apple.
