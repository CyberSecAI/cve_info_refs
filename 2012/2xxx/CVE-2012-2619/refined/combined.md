# About the security content of iOS 6.1 Software Update

This document describes the security content of iOS 6.1.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see [How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620).

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see [Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222).

## iOS 6.1

* **Identity Services**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Authentication relying on certificate-based Apple ID authentication may be bypassed

  Description: An error handling issue existed in Identity Services. If the user's AppleID certificate failed to validate, the user's AppleID was assumed to be the empty string. If multiple systems belonging to different users enter this state, applications relying on this identity determination may erroneously extend trust. This issue was addressed by ensuring that NULL is returned instead of an empty string.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0963

* **International Components for Unicode**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A canonicalization issue existed in the handling of the EUC-JP encoding, which could lead to a cross-site scripting attack on EUC-JP encoded websites. This issue was addressed by updating the EUC-JP mapping table.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3058 : Masato Kinugawa

* **Kernel**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: A user-mode process may be able to access the first page of kernel memory

  Description: The iOS kernel has checks to validate that the user-mode pointer and length passed to the copyin and copyout functions would not result in a user-mode process being able to directly access kernel memory. The checks were not being used if the length was smaller than one page. This issue was addressed through additional validation of the arguments to copyin and copyout.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0964 : Mark Dowd of Azimuth Security

* **Security**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: Several intermediate CA certificates were mistakenly issued by TURKTRUST. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other sensitive information. This issue was addressed by not allowing the incorrect SSL certificates.

* **StoreKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: JavaScript may be enabled in Mobile Safari without user interaction

  Description: If a user disabled JavaScript in Safari Preferences, visiting a site which displayed a Smart App Banner would re-enable JavaScript without warning the user. This issue was addressed by not enabling JavaScript when visiting a site with a Smart App Banner.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0974 : Andrew Plotkin of Zarfhome Software Consulting, Ben Madison of BitCloud, Marek Durcek

* **WebKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple memory corruption issues existed in WebKit. These issues were addressed through improved memory handling.

  CVE-2013-0968 : Aaron Nelson

* **WebKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Copying and pasting content on a malicious website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A cross-site scripting issue existed in the handling of content pasted from a different origin. This issue was addressed through additional validation of pasted content.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0962 : Mario Heiderich of Cure53

* **WebKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A cross-site scripting issue existed in the handling of frame elements. This issue was addressed through improved origin tracking.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-2889 : Sergey Glazunov

* **Wi-Fi**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPod touch (4th generation), iPad 2

  Impact: A remote attacker on the same Wi-Fi network may be able to temporarily disable Wi-Fi

  Description: An out of bounds read issue exists in Broadcom's BCM4325 and BCM4329 firmware's handling of 802.11i information elements. This issue was addressed through additional validation of 802.11i information elements.

## Broadcom BCM4325 and BCM4329 wireless chipset denial-of-service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#160027

Original Release Date: 2012-10-23 | Last Revised: 2013-01-28

---

### Overview

Broadcom BCM4325 and BCM4329 wireless chipsets have been reported to contain an out-of-bounds read error condition that may be exploited to produce a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| The [CORE Security Technologies advisory](http://www.coresecurity.com/content/broadcom-input-validation-BCM4325-BCM4329) states:  *"An out-of-bounds read error condition exists in broadcom's BCM4325 and BCM4329 combo solutions firmware. This error can be leveraged to denial of service attack, and possibly information disclosure. An attacker can send a RSN (802.11i) information element, that causes the WiFi NIC to stop responding."* Broadcom's official response is:*"CORE Security Technologies has identified a Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability in the firmware running on two prior generation Broadcom chips, the BCM4325 and BCM4329. Other Broadcom chips are not affected. This denial of service attack can cause an unpatched consumer electronics device to experience a WLAN service interruption. The vulnerability does not enable exposure of the consumer's data. Broadcom has firmware patches for its OEM customers to address the issue.**The vast majority of Broadcom's WLAN product portfolio is not subject to the DoS issue, including as examples:*       - *Broadcom's subsequent generations of Mobility WLAN devices, e.g., BCM4330, BCM4334, BCM43241, BCM43340, BCM4335;* - *Broadcom's products for the PC and Media market, e.g., BCM4313, BCM43142, BCM43224, BCM43228, BCM4331, BCM43236, BCM4352, BCM43526, BCM4360;* - *Broadcom's Access Point WLAN devices and products, e.g., BCM4718, BCM535x, BCM4706;*  *Broadcom has been working with multiple customers providing information and fixes as required, and will continue to address security issues that may be identified."*Additional details can be found in the [CORE Security Technologies advisory](http://www.coresecurity.com/content/broadcom-input-validation-BCM4325-BCM4329). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition against the WiFi network interface card. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Users of devices with Broadcom BCM4325 or BCM4329 wireless chipsets should contact their vendor to acquire a patch. |
