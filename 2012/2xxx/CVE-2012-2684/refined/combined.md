## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1278)

## Topic

Updated Grid component packages that fix several security issues, add
various enhancements and fix multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

A number of unprotected resources (web pages, export functionality, image
viewing) were found in Cumin. An unauthenticated user could bypass intended
access restrictions, resulting in information disclosure. (CVE-2012-2680)

Cumin could generate weak session keys, potentially allowing remote
attackers to predict session keys and obtain unauthorized access to Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2681)

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws in Cumin could allow remote attackers
to inject arbitrary web script on a web page displayed by Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2683)

An SQL injection flaw in Cumin could allow remote attackers to manipulate
the contents of the back-end database via a specially-crafted URL.
(CVE-2012-2684)

When Cumin handled image requests, clients could request images of
arbitrary sizes. This could result in large memory allocations on the Cumin
server, leading to an out-of-memory condition. (CVE-2012-2685)

Cumin did not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. If an
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the Cumin web interface,
into visiting a specially-crafted web page, it could lead to unauthorized
command execution in the Cumin web interface with the privileges of the
logged-in user. (CVE-2012-2734)

A session fixation flaw was found in Cumin. An authenticated user able to
pre-set the Cumin session cookie in a victim's browser could possibly use
this flaw to steal the victim's session after they log into Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2735)

It was found that authenticated users could send a specially-crafted HTTP
POST request to Cumin that would cause it to submit a job attribute change
to Condor. This could be used to change internal Condor attributes,
including the Owner attribute, which could allow Cumin users to elevate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-3459)

It was discovered that Condor's file system authentication challenge
accepted directories with weak permissions (for example, world readable,
writable and executable permissions). If a user created a directory with
such permissions, a local attacker could rename it, allowing them to
execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user. (CVE-2012-3492)

It was discovered that Condor exposed private information in the data in
the ClassAds format served by condor\_startd. An unauthenticated user able
to connect to condor\_startd's port could request a ClassAd for a running
job, provided they could guess or brute-force the PID of the job. This
could expose the ClaimId which, if obtained, could be used to control the
job as well as start new jobs on the system. (CVE-2012-3493)

It was discovered that the ability to abort a job in Condor only required
WRITE authorization, instead of a combination of WRITE authorization and
job ownership. This could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass
intended restrictions and abort any idle job on the system. (CVE-2012-3491)

The above issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

This update also provides defense in depth patches for Condor. (BZ#848212,
BZ#835592, BZ#841173, BZ#843476)

These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 provide numerous
enhancements and bug fixes for the Grid component of MRG. Some highlights
include:

* Integration with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager via Deltacloud
* Role enforcement in Cumin
* Cumin authentication integration with LDAP
* Enhanced Red Hat HA integration managing multiple-schedulers nodes
* Generic local resource limits for partitionable slots
* Concurrency limit groups

Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, linked to in the
References section, for information on these changes.

## Solution

All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 are advised
to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. Condor
and Cumin must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1281)

## Topic

Updated Grid component packages that fix several security issues, add
various enhancements and fix multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

A number of unprotected resources (web pages, export functionality, image
viewing) were found in Cumin. An unauthenticated user could bypass intended
access restrictions, resulting in information disclosure. (CVE-2012-2680)

Cumin could generate weak session keys, potentially allowing remote
attackers to predict session keys and obtain unauthorized access to Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2681)

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws in Cumin could allow remote attackers
to inject arbitrary web script on a web page displayed by Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2683)

An SQL injection flaw in Cumin could allow remote attackers to manipulate
the contents of the back-end database via a specially-crafted URL.
(CVE-2012-2684)

When Cumin handled image requests, clients could request images of
arbitrary sizes. This could result in large memory allocations on the Cumin
server, leading to an out-of-memory condition. (CVE-2012-2685)

Cumin did not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. If an
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the Cumin web interface,
into visiting a specially-crafted web page, it could lead to unauthorized
command execution in the Cumin web interface with the privileges of the
logged-in user. (CVE-2012-2734)

A session fixation flaw was found in Cumin. An authenticated user able to
pre-set the Cumin session cookie in a victim's browser could possibly use
this flaw to steal the victim's session after they log into Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2735)

It was found that authenticated users could send a specially-crafted HTTP
POST request to Cumin that would cause it to submit a job attribute change
to Condor. This could be used to change internal Condor attributes,
including the Owner attribute, which could allow Cumin users to elevate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-3459)

It was discovered that Condor's file system authentication challenge
accepted directories with weak permissions (for example, world readable,
writable and executable permissions). If a user created a directory with
such permissions, a local attacker could rename it, allowing them to
execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user. (CVE-2012-3492)

It was discovered that Condor exposed private information in the data in
the ClassAds format served by condor\_startd. An unauthenticated user able
to connect to condor\_startd's port could request a ClassAd for a running
job, provided they could guess or brute-force the PID of the job. This
could expose the ClaimId which, if obtained, could be used to control the
job as well as start new jobs on the system. (CVE-2012-3493)

It was discovered that the ability to abort a job in Condor only required
WRITE authorization, instead of a combination of WRITE authorization and
job ownership. This could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass
intended restrictions and abort any idle job on the system. (CVE-2012-3491)

The above issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

This update also provides defense in depth patches for Condor. (BZ#848212,
BZ#835592, BZ#841173, BZ#843476)

These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 provide numerous
enhancements and bug fixes for the Grid component of MRG. Some highlights
include:

* Integration with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager via Deltacloud
* Role enforcement in Cumin
* Cumin authentication integration with LDAP
* Enhanced Red Hat HA integration managing multiple-schedulers nodes
* Generic local resource limits for partitionable slots
* Concurrency limit groups

Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, linked to in the
References section, for information on these changes.

## Solution

All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 are advised
to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. Condor
and Cumin must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-08 15:56:08 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer reported an SQL injection flaw in Cumin, where the agent variable is not properly encoded.  This could allow a remote user to manipulate the contents of the backend database using a specially-crafted URL.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c2)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-08 22:08:06 UTC  ``` Started investigating this.  Bad values for agent or object ids are constructed (indirectly) in the get_sample_filters_by_signature() routine.  This routine is used to pull certain values out of the URL to use as a lookup for an object in question.  The root of the issue is the way that SQL filter text is generated using Python string concatenation.  According to docs associated with psycopg2 (our db adapter), using string concatenation directly leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities due to bad quoting.  psycopg2 provides a mechanism that uses a template and values to create properly formatted/escaped SQL strings.  The authors strongly recommend that Py string concatention never, ever be used.  Developing.  We use the template mechanism in other places, but not everywhere.  This may resolve to scrubbing the rosemary code for any place where concat is used and replacing with the psycopg mechanism.  Will continue investigating with test programs....   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c4)  Florian Weimer    2012-06-11 08:16:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c2)) > Bad values for agent or object ids are constructed (indirectly) in the > get_sample_filters_by_signature() routine.  This routine is used to pull > certain values out of the URL to use as a lookup for an object in question.  Good catch.  So this has:          col = self.sql_samples_table._qmf_agent_id         filters.append(SqlComparisonFilter(col, "'%s'" % agent_id))          col = self.sql_samples_table._qmf_object_id         filters.append(SqlComparisonFilter(col, "'%s'" % obj_id))  Ideally, this should be          col = self.sql_samples_table._qmf_agent_id         filters.append(SqlComparisonFilter(col, agent_id))          col = self.sql_samples_table._qmf_object_id         filters.append(SqlComparisonFilter(col, obj_id))  and SqlComparisonFilter would take care of the escaping (or prepare things for use in a parameterized query).  This should fix all users of SqlComparisonFilter (I think), except for ObjectSqlAdapter.add_value_filter(), which would break.  (The code in r5192 is different.)  > The root of the issue is the way that SQL filter text is generated using Python > string concatenation.

Yes, it's hard to avoid SQL injection issues if you rely on plain string concatenation.  > psycopg2 provides a mechanism that uses a > template and values to create properly formatted/escaped SQL strings.  The > authors strongly recommend that Py string concatention never, ever be used.  In order to use this mechanism, you'd have to tracker parameter values separately from the SQL string (which would have to be constructed using parameters).  In other words, instead of constructing a string, you construct a pair (sql, params), where params is a tuple containing the parameter values.  For a short term solution, I think it is preferable to add the missing quoting in the correct place.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c5)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-12 02:04:26 UTC  ``` Attaching a patch for this issue, tested in a scratch build on el6.  The pyscopg2.cursor.mogrify(text, values) method uses the same mechanism as pyscopg2.cursor.execute(text, values) to do substitution, with proper quoting provided by psycopg2.  The difference is that mogrify just returns the query string (whereas execute builds the string with substitution and then executes it).  For the filter cases, the string concatentation can be replaced with use of cursor.mogrify().  Anything in Cumin that builds query strings with an embedded pattern like "%(Name)s" is already being handled ultimately by cursor.execute(text, values), so those are fine.  This applies to most of the instances of SqlComparisonFilter, as well as it's derived types SqlValueFilter and SqlLikeFilter.  To keep everything compatible, SqlComparisonFilter has been extended with extra arguments that allow it to obtain a cursor object and apply psycopg2 quoting selectively.  This is used in the get_sample_filters_by_signature() call and in one other place, admin.get_roles_for_user(), although in the second it is not strictly necessary (but safer to do anyway).  The only case I'm not certain about is the SqlExistenceFilter.  Not sure what this is trying to accomplish, but it is only used in a single place under the Messaging UI and the "subquery" is an instance of SqlComparisonFilter with a "%(name)s" type pattern, so I'm pretty confident it's fine.  Will continue to look at this (something seems to have broken with newer versions of the broker which is preventing me from testing it).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c6)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-12 02:20:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 591059](attachment.cgi?id=591059&action=diff "Patch for the comparison filter") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=591059&action=edit "Patch for the comparison filter") Patch for the comparison filter   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c7)  Trevor McKay    2012-07-30 16:57:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 601316](attachment.cgi?id=601316&action=diff "Patch for the comparison filter") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=601316&action=edit "Patch for the comparison filter") Patch for the comparison filter   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c8)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 15:58:19 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:43:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1278 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1278.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:52:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1281 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1281.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c11)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 21:10:22 UTC  ``` Created cumin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 858868](show_bug.cgi?id=858868 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2680 CVE-2012-2681 CVE-2012-2683 CVE-2012-2684 CVE-2012-2685 CVE-2012-2734 CVE-2012-2735 CVE-2012-3459 cumin various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c12)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-20 03:02:11 UTC  ``` cumin-0.1.5522-4.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

This includes an XSS in error message displays due to not filtering the displayed output, and not escaping quotes in source HTML on certain pages.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=830243#c2)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-08 17:14:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 590472](attachment.cgi?id=590472&action=diff "Call xml_escape() on error page content") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=590472&action=edit "Call xml_escape() on error page content") Call xml_escape() on error page content   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=830243#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 16:10:01 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  These issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=830243#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:43:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1278 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1278.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=830243#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:52:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1281 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1281.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=830243#c8)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 21:09:59 UTC  ``` Created cumin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 858868](show_bug.cgi?id=858868 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2680 CVE-2012-2681 CVE-2012-2683 CVE-2012-2684 CVE-2012-2685 CVE-2012-2734 CVE-2012-2735 CVE-2012-3459 cumin various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=830243#c9)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-20 03:02:03 UTC  ``` cumin-0.1.5522-4.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-08 15:56:08 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer reported an SQL injection flaw in Cumin, where the agent variable is not properly encoded.  This could allow a remote user to manipulate the contents of the backend database using a specially-crafted URL.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c2)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-08 22:08:06 UTC  ``` Started investigating this.  Bad values for agent or object ids are constructed (indirectly) in the get_sample_filters_by_signature() routine.  This routine is used to pull certain values out of the URL to use as a lookup for an object in question.  The root of the issue is the way that SQL filter text is generated using Python string concatenation.  According to docs associated with psycopg2 (our db adapter), using string concatenation directly leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities due to bad quoting.  psycopg2 provides a mechanism that uses a template and values to create properly formatted/escaped SQL strings.  The authors strongly recommend that Py string concatention never, ever be used.  Developing.  We use the template mechanism in other places, but not everywhere.  This may resolve to scrubbing the rosemary code for any place where concat is used and replacing with the psycopg mechanism.  Will continue investigating with test programs....   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c4)  Florian Weimer    2012-06-11 08:16:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c2)) > Bad values for agent or object ids are constructed (indirectly) in the > get_sample_filters_by_signature() routine.  This routine is used to pull > certain values out of the URL to use as a lookup for an object in question.  Good catch.  So this has:          col = self.sql_samples_table._qmf_agent_id         filters.append(SqlComparisonFilter(col, "'%s'" % agent_id))          col = self.sql_samples_table._qmf_object_id         filters.append(SqlComparisonFilter(col, "'%s'" % obj_id))  Ideally, this should be          col = self.sql_samples_table._qmf_agent_id         filters.append(SqlComparisonFilter(col, agent_id))          col = self.sql_samples_table._qmf_object_id         filters.append(SqlComparisonFilter(col, obj_id))  and SqlComparisonFilter would take care of the escaping (or prepare things for use in a parameterized query).  This should fix all users of SqlComparisonFilter (I think), except for ObjectSqlAdapter.add_value_filter(), which would break.  (The code in r5192 is different.)  > The root of the issue is the way that SQL filter text is generated using Python > string concatenation.

Yes, it's hard to avoid SQL injection issues if you rely on plain string concatenation.  > psycopg2 provides a mechanism that uses a > template and values to create properly formatted/escaped SQL strings.  The > authors strongly recommend that Py string concatention never, ever be used.  In order to use this mechanism, you'd have to tracker parameter values separately from the SQL string (which would have to be constructed using parameters).  In other words, instead of constructing a string, you construct a pair (sql, params), where params is a tuple containing the parameter values.  For a short term solution, I think it is preferable to add the missing quoting in the correct place.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c5)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-12 02:04:26 UTC  ``` Attaching a patch for this issue, tested in a scratch build on el6.  The pyscopg2.cursor.mogrify(text, values) method uses the same mechanism as pyscopg2.cursor.execute(text, values) to do substitution, with proper quoting provided by psycopg2.  The difference is that mogrify just returns the query string (whereas execute builds the string with substitution and then executes it).  For the filter cases, the string concatentation can be replaced with use of cursor.mogrify().  Anything in Cumin that builds query strings with an embedded pattern like "%(Name)s" is already being handled ultimately by cursor.execute(text, values), so those are fine.  This applies to most of the instances of SqlComparisonFilter, as well as it's derived types SqlValueFilter and SqlLikeFilter.  To keep everything compatible, SqlComparisonFilter has been extended with extra arguments that allow it to obtain a cursor object and apply psycopg2 quoting selectively.  This is used in the get_sample_filters_by_signature() call and in one other place, admin.get_roles_for_user(), although in the second it is not strictly necessary (but safer to do anyway).  The only case I'm not certain about is the SqlExistenceFilter.  Not sure what this is trying to accomplish, but it is only used in a single place under the Messaging UI and the "subquery" is an instance of SqlComparisonFilter with a "%(name)s" type pattern, so I'm pretty confident it's fine.  Will continue to look at this (something seems to have broken with newer versions of the broker which is preventing me from testing it).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c6)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-12 02:20:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 591059](attachment.cgi?id=591059&action=diff "Patch for the comparison filter") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=591059&action=edit "Patch for the comparison filter") Patch for the comparison filter   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c7)  Trevor McKay    2012-07-30 16:57:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 601316](attachment.cgi?id=601316&action=diff "Patch for the comparison filter") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=601316&action=edit "Patch for the comparison filter") Patch for the comparison filter   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c8)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 15:58:19 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:43:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1278 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1278.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:52:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1281 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1281.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c11)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 21:10:22 UTC  ``` Created cumin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 858868](show_bug.cgi?id=858868 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2680 CVE-2012-2681 CVE-2012-2683 CVE-2012-2684 CVE-2012-2685 CVE-2012-2734 CVE-2012-2735 CVE-2012-3459 cumin various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=830245#c12)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-20 03:02:11 UTC  ``` cumin-0.1.5522-4.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.
