{
  "cveId": "CVE-2012-2654",
  "description": "When creating security group rules, any case for the protocol was accepted as input, such as TCP, Tcp, tcp, etc., and was stored in the database as specified. However, unless specified as all lowercase, the code to apply the rules would break and result in some rules not being applied.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Case-sensitive comparison of protocol strings in the firewall rule application logic.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The API allowed mixed-case protocol names, but the firewall rule application logic expected lowercase.",
       "The database stored the protocol exactly as entered, without normalization.",
      "Lack of input sanitization or normalization of protocol strings before processing.",
      "Case-sensitive string comparison"
    ],
    "impact": "Security group rules might not be applied correctly, potentially leaving systems more exposed than intended. Incorrect case for protocol definition would cause a later string comparison to fail, leading to security groups not being set correctly. Subsequent modifications to the security group would also fail.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "An attacker could specify a protocol name in mixed case during security group rule creation via the EC2 or OS APIs.",
       "An attacker can't directly exploit this, but it allows for a bypass of intended security rules."
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to create or modify security group rules, which typically requires access to cloud management API. "
