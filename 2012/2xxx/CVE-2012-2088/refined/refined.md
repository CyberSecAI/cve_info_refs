{
  "CVE-2012-2088": {
    "Description": "A type-conversion flaw leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libtiff reads certain tiled tiff files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted TIFF image that, when opened, could cause an application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "Root cause": "Improper conversion between signed and unsigned integer values.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could create a specially-crafted TIFF image that, when opened, could cause an application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application or a Denial of Service condition.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted TIFF file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious TIFF file and entice a user to open it with a vulnerable application"
  }
