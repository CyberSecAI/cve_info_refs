- The `username` parameter is vulnerable.
- The `password` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially manipulate SQL queries to bypass authentication.
- Possible access to sensitive database information.
- Possible modification or deletion of data.
- Potential for further attacks depending on the application and database structure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed via HTTP POST requests to the `/timesheet/login.php` endpoint.
- The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within the `username` and `password` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server.
