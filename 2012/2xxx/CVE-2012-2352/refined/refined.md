Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-2352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authorization mechanism of Sympa's web interface, specifically in the `arc_manage`, `arc_download`, and `arc_delete` functions. These functions, responsible for archive management, lacked proper access control checks, allowing unauthorized users to bypass intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authorization Bypass:** The core weakness is the insufficient access control in the `do_arc_manage`, `do_arc_download`, and `do_arc_delete` subroutines.  Specifically, the code did not verify if the user was authorized to perform archive-related actions on a specific list before allowing access to the archive management page, or download/delete list archives.
*   **Missing Access Control Checks:** The code was missing a check to see if a user had the "web_archive.access" right before proceeding with archive operations, thereby exposing functionality intended for list members only to the public.
*   **Insecure Defaults**: The default behavior allowed access to functions by unauthorized users, which suggests an insecure default configuration or implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to Archives:** An attacker could access the archive management page even for lists that should have been restricted to members.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could download the archives of private mailing lists, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Data Loss:** An attacker could delete archives of private mailing lists, resulting in data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of Sympa. An attacker would need to access the `arc_manage` page or call the `arc_download`/`arc_delete` functions with the appropriate list parameter.
*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability could be exploited by directly crafting HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Sympa server and its web interface.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, or a member of a specific mailing list, to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper authorization checks.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located within the `wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in` file.
*   The fix involves adding checks for the `web_archive.access` right to the `do_arc_manage`, `do_arc_download`, and `do_arc_delete` functions.
*   The code diff shows the introduction of `unless (defined &check_authz('do_arc', 'web_archive.access'))` checks to prevent unauthorized access.

**Affected Versions:**
*   All Sympa versions prior to 6.1.11 are vulnerable.

**Fix:**
*   The fix was implemented in Sympa version 6.1.11.
*   The Debian security advisory indicates the fix has been backported to version 6.0.1+dfsg-4+squeeze1 for the stable distribution(squeeze).

In summary, CVE-2012-2352 is an authorization bypass vulnerability in Sympa that allows unauthenticated users to access, download, and delete archives of restricted mailing lists due to insufficient access control checks on archive management functions.
