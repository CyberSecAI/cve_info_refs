Subject: CVE request: sympa (try again)

Hi,

Please assign a CVE for Sympa, any version prior to 6.1.11. It is
possible to open the archive management ("arc_manage") page for any
list, even those set to only be available to members, giving anyone the
option to download the archive, or delete the archive.

<http://www.sympa.org/distribution/latest-stable/NEWS>
<https://sourcesup.renater.fr/scm/viewvc.php/branches/sympa-6.0-branch/wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in?root=sympa&r1=6706&r2=7358&pathrev=7358>

thank you,
micah

ps - for some reason the previous message is formatted strange, so I'm
sending this one without the signature

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Ok I see this one and several more:

================================

6.1.11		May 11, 2012
Bug fixes:
[7358] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Fixing a potential security issue
related to archives

================================

6.1.1           October 22, 2010
This version includes a lots news such as DKIM support, autosignoff
footer link included in lists messages, ...
Various vulnerability have been solved in 6.1.1 : cross side scripting,
cross-Site request forgeries, brute force attack, DOS. These
vulnerabilities were identified with the help of P. Gardenat (Rectorat
 de Rennes) during a security audit on Sympa.
- ---------------------
web_tt2/error.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Now shared document
can't	be read or edited unless list is open. This is a security fix

================================

6.0		1st October 2009
Security:
- - [reported by T. Retout] SQL injection threat removed by using place
holders instead of direct sprint in a query.
- - [Submitted by N. Bertrand, univ.  Minnesota] Basic logs in debug
don't issue the password  unencrypted in the logs for function
Auth::ldap_authentication. This way, this password won't be sent
unencrypted to a possible syslog server.
- - [#4439] [#4440] [reported by O.Berger] security vulnerability which
use a file in /tmp.
- - [#4430] store temporary files in Sympa's own tmp directory instead
of /tmp to prevent symlink attacks

================================

Can you confirm these and I will assign CVE's for the outstanding issues.

Package        : sympa
Vulnerability  : authorization bypass
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2352
Debian Bug     :

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Sympa, a mailing list
manager, that allow to skip the scenario-based authorization
mechanisms. This vulnerability allows to display the archives
management page, and download and delete the list archives by
unauthorized users.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0.1+dfsg-4+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.1.11~dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your sympa packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
