{
  "CVE-2012-2384": {
    "Description": "On 32-bit systems, a large args->num_cliprects from userspace via ioctl may overflow the allocation size, leading to out-of-bounds access.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when calculating the allocation size for cliprects based on user-provided input (args->num_cliprects).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds access"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Out-of-bounds memory access, potentially leading to system crashes or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attack via a crafted ioctl call to the drm driver.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to execute ioctl calls on the vulnerable system, typically requiring local access or the ability to influence the execution of an application that can do so.",
        "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was introduced in commit 432e58ed in the Linux kernel's DRM subsystem."
