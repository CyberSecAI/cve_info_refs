Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2942:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided documents directly mention CVE-2012-2942 and describe a buffer overflow vulnerability in HAProxy related to header processing and a specific configuration option (`global.tune.bufsize`). This matches the description of CVE-2012-2942.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root cause:** A boundary error during data copying into the "trash buffer" within the header capture functionality.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   Buffer overflow in the trash buffer of HAProxy's header capture mechanism.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   Denial of service.
*  **Attack vectors:**
   *  Remote attackers can trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted network traffic to the HAProxy server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Attacker needs to send network traffic to the HAProxy instance.
    *   The HAProxy configuration needs to have `global.tune.bufsize` set to a value greater than the default (16384 bytes).
    *   Header rewriting must be enabled through directives like `regrep` or `rsprep`

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects HAProxy versions prior to 1.4.21.
*   The fix for this issue was included in HAProxy version 1.4.21 and in the git repository.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during header capture when the `global.tune.bufsize` setting is non-default and header rewriting is enabled.

**Summary of extracted information:**

CVE-2012-2942 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in HAProxy that occurs due to a boundary error when copying data into the trash buffer during header capture. This vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers sending specific network traffic, leading to potential arbitrary code execution or a denial of service. The exploit requires a non-default value for the `global.tune.bufsize` configuration option, and that header rewriting is enabled. Versions of HAProxy prior to 1.4.21 are affected.
