**HAProxyConf 2025 Call for Papers** The next edition of the HAProxyConf will be held on June 4-5 2025, with some workshops on June 3. The [Call for Papers is open](https://www.haproxyconf.com/call-for-papers/). If you feel like you're doing awesome things with HAProxy, that it eases your job, reduces your costs, if you think you've figured smart ways to use it and want to share your findings, if you've written useful companion tools that your friends constantly tell you you should advertise more, and even if you want to express some criticism, please consider submitting a paper to the link above. If you just want to attend, see where it's held, how to get there or register, you can also [visit the conference's site](https://www.haproxyconf.com/) (registrations are expected to open very soon).  **May, 29th, 2024** : **HAProxy 3.0.0 release** Once again, 3.0 has been a release focusing on polishing a lot of the existing things and sprinkling lots of small new features all around, including crt-stores to ease cert management, GUIDs to config objects for more reliable state manipulation, stats preservation across reloads, syslog load balancing, JSON & CBOR logging, virtual maps/acls, improved performance all over the board (Lua, stick-tables, rings), improved H2/H3 protection against protocol-level attacks. A lot more details are explained on the [HAProxyTech's blog](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/announcing-haproxy-3-0), and the [mailing-list announcement](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy%40formilux.org/msg44993.html) summarizes most of these at a higher level.  **Dec, 5th, 2023** : **HAProxy 2.9.0 release** This release has received a lot of small changes that are difficult to summarize. Most of them were aimed at improving performance and resource usage in general (zero-copy forwarding, QUIC's smaller footprint for closed connections, improved scalability), others focusing on better integration with other components (support for the AWS-LC crypto library, QUIC OpenSSL compatitility layer, PROXY protocol manipulation), ease of configuration (most log-format tags now have an equivalent sample fetch, some converters support variables in addition to integers, warnings about bad cpu-map or thread settings), more reliability (log backends with checked servers, better debugging), and a really cool new feature to play with, reverse-http. A lot more details are explained on the [HAProxyTech's blog](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/announcing-haproxy-2-9), and the [mailing-list announcement](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy%40formilux.org/msg43600.html) summarizes most of these at a higher level.  [***Older news...***](/news.html) Description HAProxy is a free, very fast and reliable reverse-proxy offering [high availability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability), [load balancing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancer), and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. It is particularly suited for very high traffic web sites and powers a significant portion of the world's most visited ones. Over the years it has become the de-facto standard opensource load balancer, is now shipped with most mainstream Linux distributions, and is often deployed by default in cloud platforms. Since it does not advertise itself, we only know it's used when the [admins report it](/they-use-it.html) :-) The HAProxy core team maintains multiple versions in parallel. Since version 1.8, two major version are emitted every year. The first digit usually indicates a breaking change (config format etc) but in practice rarely changes. The second digit indicates new features. Both constitute a **branch**. One extra number appears after these digits to indicate the bug fix release. The core team deploys a lot of efforts backporting fixes to older releases while being extremely careful not to break anything. For this reason, it is really important to stay up to date within one branch, i.e. having the highest possible number on the last digits. Branches with an even number are called "LTS" (for "long term support") and area maintained for 5 years after their release. During this time they will receive fixes for bugs that are discovered after the release. These branches are aimed at general users who seek extreme stability and do not want to qualify a new version too often but still want to receive fixes. Branches with an odd number are only called "stable", they're aimed at highly skilled users who prefer to upgrade often to benefit from modern features, and who are also able to roll back in case of problem. These versions are maintained between 12 and 18 months. The duration is short and purposely not strict so that the maintenance cycle is decided with users based on feedback, and so that these versions do not end up in embedded products. It may happen that a few features are backported to these version if there is some reasonable demand and the operation is considered riskless enough. Everyone used to dealing with production knows that it's difficult to upgrade components in field when one has to plan and advertise upwards of any operation. For this reason, the HAProxy core team doesn't insist on users to upgrade, will not ask someone to switch to a new branch (unless they ask for a feature that is part of that other branch), but will often ask the user to re-check with the latest version of their branch before reporting a problem, because nobody likes to troubleshoot a problem a second time. It's often suggested to use the versions that come with the operating system when it follows the official maintenance cycle, and depending on the expected level of stability or exposure, some users may want to update as soon as an update is available while others may prefer to wait a few weeks to a month to be sure the update is reliable enough for them. Here's a very rough history of changes in each major version:  * **version 3.0** : crt-stores, persistent stats, syslog load balancing, JSON&CBOR log encoding, virtual maps &acls, zero-copy from the cache, H2/H3 protocol-level protections* **version 2.9** : reverse-http, log backends, zero-copy forwarding, memory usage reduction, increased bandwidth, better general scalability, AWS-LC support, QUIC openssl compat layer, PROXY protocol manipulation* **version 2.8** : QUIC now prod ready, Lua-based mailers, OCSP auto updates, LetsEncrypt, wolfSSL support, RFC7239 "forwarded", listeners on more than 64 threads, perf/usability/reliability/observability improvements* **version 2.7** : Traffic shaping, QUIC improvements, thread groups, easier switch to alternate SSL libraries, improved debugging* **version 2.6** : QUIC/HTTP3, OpenSSL 3.0, better usability, improved code accessibility and maintenance  Hide/Show older ones ...* **version 2.5** : runtime server addition/removal, runtime CA/CRL updates, native HTTP client, simplified HTTPS logging, default TCP/HTTP rulesets, JWT validation, and more* **version 2.4** : syslog and DNS over TCP, multi-threaded Lua, full sharing of idle conns, lower latency, server-side dynamic SSL update, Opentracing, WebSocket over H2, atomic maps, Vary support, new debugging tools, even more user-friendly CLI and configuration, lots of cleanups* **version 2.3** : syslog forwarding, better idle conn management, improved balancing with large queues, simplified SSL managment, more stats metrics, stricter config checking by default, general performance improvements* **version 2.2** : runtime certificate additions, improved idle connection management, logging over TCP, HTTP "return" directive, errorfile templates, TLSv1.2 by default, extensible health-checks* **version 2.1** : improved I/Os and multi-threading, FastCGI, runtime certificate updates, HTX-only, improved debugging, removal of obsolete keywords* **version 2.0** : gRPC, layer 7 retries, process manager, SSL peers, log load balancing/sampling, end-to-end TCP fast-open, automatic settings (maxconn, threads, HTTP reuse, pools), ...* **version 1.9** : improved multi-threading, end-to-end HTTP/2, connection pools, queue priority control, stdout logging, ...* **version 1.8** : multi-threading, HTTP/2, cache, on-the fly server addition/removal, seamless reloads, DNS SRV, hardware SSL engines, ...* **version 1.7** : added server hot reconfiguration, content processing agents, multi-type certs, ...* **version 1.6** : added DNS resolution support, HTTP connection multiplexing, full stick-table replication, stateless compression, ...* **version 1.5** : added SSL, IPv6, server-side keep-alive, DDoS protection, ...* **version 1.4** : client-side keep-alive, stick to any expression, more complete CLI* **version 1.3** : ACL & content switching (frontend/backend split), CLI, TCP splicing, dynamic LB algos* **version 1.2** : epoll, queuing, more LB algorithms* **version 1.1** : health checks, cookie insertion* **version 1.0** : high availability, cookie-based stickiness   Performance  As shown in [this test run on AWS ARM-based Graviton2](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy-forwards-over-2-million-http-requests-per-second-on-a-single-aws-arm-instance/), HAProxy scales very well with threads and was shown to be able to reach 2 million requests/s over SSL and 100 Gbps for forwarded traffic.  This is made possible thanks to its [**event-driven**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_driven) architecture that allows to react extremely quickly to I/O events, its parallelism on SMP machines provided by light multi-threading, a task scheduler that permanently composes between low-latency and high throughput, and generally speaking a permanent quest of resource savings at every single architecture layer. These efforts tend to cost a bit in development time but are immediately valued by users who are able to reduce their number of machines upgrade after upgrade. For the vast majority of common loads, the HAProxy process is simply not noticed, which tends to make its users forget it, sometimes resulting in questions regarding extremely old versions.  Please consult [this section](/oldstuff.html#perf) for more information on the architecture details and some performance test results.  Reliability - *keeping high-traffic sites online since 2002* HAProxy is first known for being extremely robust. The core team developers tend to be irritated by certain bugs they fix, but this is because their job is to see them all. Most users report having never ever faced any single crash and claim that HAProxy is the most solid part of their infrastructure. Finding machines with HAProxy processes being up for more than 3 years is not exceptional at all! All this is not an accident, though. A lot of efforts are made in that direction, to provide excellent observability on what is happening, and an amazing number of protections against bad behaviors. HAProxy is built with many checks for unacceptable situations (impossible conditions, endless loops, etc) that in other products might result in service outages or data corruption, but in HAProxy will immediately result in a crash with a dump of the problem. This rigor pays off since most users have never faced such an issue, thanks to the few who faced them and provided useful reports allowing to fix the problem early. The development process also encourages quality, with a long term maintenance cycle: versions are maintained for 5 years by the same developers who code the new features. This encourages them to write high quality code and commit messages that correspond to the highest standards. A regression testing suite is used and run along development by all developers and before merging code, as well as after on a wide variety of platforms thanks to the continuous integration (CI) system. The principle of "eating one's dog's food" applies here as well: haproxy.org runs on the latest development release. This usually helps spot a bug or two per major version before it hits a release. But in addition it maintains a permanent pressure on the development team to release something they're confident in. The program having been designed from its early age to be extremely conservative on resource usage, a significant number of settings are calculated at startup time and enforce many limits on number of sockets, connections, streams etc, guaranteeing that any processing that was started will complete. Security - *Hardened by default* Security is a very important concern when deploying a software load balancer, because it runs at the edge and takes all the dirty traffic. It is possible to harden the OS, to limit the number of open ports and accessible services, but the load balancer itself stays exposed. The unified and non-fantasist [coding style](/coding-style.html) aims at avoiding common traps when writing or reviewing code. Some high standards are sought when it comes to dealing with unvalidated data. Non-portable functions and those having unreliable behaviors are avoided or replaced. Input data gets sanitized very early in the lower layers. Resource usage is carefully controlled. Dangling pointers are forbidden in the code via careful release functions. These standards already help eliminate a great deal of uncertainty in the code itself. Since zero-bug is not reasonable, the product embarks a number of defensive measures, such as chroot, privilege drops, fork prevention, strict protocol validation, checks for impossible states and detailed traces in case of violation detection, etc. All these usually result in an attempt to exploit a real bug in a failure or possibly a crash. These measures have to be purposely disabled by the user using sufficiently evocative commands so that the reason for doing so has to be regularly questioned.

Commercial Support and availability If you think you don't have the time and skills to setup and maintain a free load balancer, or if you're seeking for commercial support to satisfy your customers or your boss, you have the following options :  1. contact [HAProxy Technologies](https://www.haproxy.com/services/haproxy-professional-services/)    to hire some professional services or subscribe a support contract ;- install [HAProxy Enterprise Edition (HAPEE)](https://www.haproxy.com/products/haproxy-enterprise-edition/),      which is a long-term maintained HAProxy package accompanied by a well-polished collection of software, scripts,      configuration files and documentation which significantly simplifies the setup and maintenance of a completely      operational solution ; it is particularly suited to **Cloud environments** where deployments must be fast.- try an [ALOHA appliance](https://www.haproxy.com/products/main-features-of-aloha-load-balancers/)        (hardware or virtual), which will even save you from having to worry about the system, hardware and from managing a Unix-like        system.  I also find it important to credit [**Loadbalancer.org**](http://www.loadbalancer.org/). I am not affiliated with them at all but like us, they have contributed a fair amount of time and money to the project to add new features and they help users on the mailing list, so I have some respect for what they do. They're a UK-based company and their load balancer also employs HAProxy, though it is somewhat different from the ALOHA. Contacts Feel free to contact us for any questions or comments :  * mailing-list :       Read the list [archives on mail-archive](https://www.mail-archive.com/haproxy%40formilux.org/)   Some people regularly ask if it is possible to send donations, so I have set up a Paypal account for this. **[Click here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=w%401wt%2eeu&lc=FR&item_name=Willy%20Tarreau¤cy_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted)** if you want to donate.

Subject: CVE request: haproxy trash buffer overflow flaw

Could a CVE be assigned to this flaw please?

A flaw was reported in HAProxy where, due to a boundary error when
copying data into the trash buffer, an external attacker could cause a
buffer overflow.  Exploiting this flaw could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, however it requires non-default settings for the
global.tune.bufsize configuration option (must be set to a value greater
than the default), and also that header rewriting is enabled (via, for
example, the regrep or rsprep directives).

This flaw is reported against 1.4.20, prior versions may also be
affected.  This has been fixed upstream in version 1.4.21 and in git.

Subject: Duplicate CVE identifiers (CVE-2012-2391 and CVE-2012-2942) assigned
 to HAProxy issue

Hello Steve, vendors,

previously the CVE identifier of CVE-2012-2391 has been assigned to the following issue:
[1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/23/12>
[2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/23/15>

Today when checking CVE new mail, noticed the CVE-2012-2942 yet:

======================================================

Reference: URL:<http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/75777> [Open URL]

Buffer overflow in the trash buffer in the header capture
functionality in HAProxy before 1.4.21, when global.tune.bufsize is
set to a value greater than the default and header rewriting is
enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

Both of these are referring to the same issue.

Steve, CVE-assign could you clarify which CVE id should be kept and
which one should be rejected as duplicate?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:45:54 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached an updated graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a configure in the tarball, so the ebuild might look a little funny because it uses autogen.sh instead of configure.  Besides the version update, the following was added:  1. Dependencies 2. conditional tcltk dependency (Not sure if this works for portage tcl-tk-8.3.3, as the portage version is broken.  It doesn't install private headers.  I submitted fixed tcl and tk ebuilds to this list previously, and it works with those)  3. Documentation  I have also attached a diff between the original and the new ebuild.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:46:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2](attachment.cgi?id=2 "graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=2&action=edit "graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild")] graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:47:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3](attachment.cgi?id=3 "graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=3&action=edit "graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=3&action=diff "graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff")] graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 22:13:33 UTC  ``` commited, added depends on 25 too, so that I get notified when 25 is fixed. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

2006/04/15 : 1.2.12
Very few changes preparing for more important changes to support per-server
session limitations and queueing :
- ignore leading empty lines in HTTP requests as suggested by RFC2616.
- added the 'weight' parameter to the servers, limited to 1..256. It applies
to roundrobin and source hash.
- the optional '-s' option could clobber '-st' and '-sf' if compiled in.
2006/03/30 : 1.2.11.1
- under some conditions, it might have been possible that when the
last dead server became available, it would not have been used
till another one would have changed state. Could not be reproduced
at all, however seems possible from the code.
2006/03/25 : 1.2.11
- added the '-db' command-line option to disable backgrounding.
- added the -sf/-st command-line arguments which are used to specify
a list of pids to send a FINISH or TERMINATE signal upon startup.
They will also be asked to release their port if a bind fails.
- reworked the startup mechanism to allow the sending of a signal to a list
of old pids if a socket cannot be bound, with a retry for a limited amount
of time (1 second by default).
- added the ability to enforce limits on memory usage.
- added the 'source' load-balancing algorithm which uses the source IP(v4|v6)
- re-architectured the server round-robin mechanism to ease integration of
other algorithms. It now relies on the number of active and backup servers.
- added a counter for the number of active and backup servers, and report
these numbers upon SIGHUP or state change.
2006/03/23 : 1.2.10.1
- while fixing the backup server round-robin "feature", a new bug was
introduced which could miss some backup servers.
- the displayed proxy name was wrong when dumping upon SIGHUP.
2006/03/19 : 1.2.10
- assert.h is needed when DEBUG is defined.
- ENORMOUS long standing bug affecting the epoll polling system :
event\_data is a union, not a structure !
- Make fd management more robust and easier to debug. Also some
micro-optimisations.
- Limit the number of consecutive accept() in multi-process mode.
This produces a more evenly distributed load across the processes and
slightly improves performance by reducing bottlenecks.
- Make health-checks be more regular, and faster to retry after a timeout.
- Fixed some messages to ease parsing of alerts.
- provided a patch to enable epoll on RHEL3 kernels.
- Separated OpenBSD build from the main Makefile into a new one.
2006/03/15 : 1.2.9
- haproxy could not be stopped after being paused, it had to be woken up
first. This has been fixed.
- the 'ulimit-n' parameter is now optional and by default computed from
maxconn + the number of listeners + the number of health-checks.
- it is now possible to specify a maximum number of connections at build
time with the SYSTEM\_MAXCONN define. The value set in the configuration
file will then be limited to this value, and only the command-line '-n'
option will be able to bypass it. It will prevent against accidental
high memory usage on small systems.
- RFC2616 expects that any HTTP agent accepts multi-line headers. Earlier
versions did not detect a line beginning with a space as the continuation
of previous header. It is now correct.
- health checks sent to servers configured with identical intervals were
sent in perfect synchronisation because the initial time was the same
for all. This could induce high load peaks when fragile servers were
hosting tens of instances for the same application. Now the load is
spread evenly across the smallest interval amongst a listener.
- a new 'forceclose' option was added to make the proxy close the outgoing
channel to the server once it has sent all its headers and the server
starts responding. This helps some servers which don't close upon the
'Connection: close' header. It implies 'option httpclose'.
- there was a bug in the way the backup servers were handled. They were
erroneously load-balanced while the doc said the opposite. Since
load-balanced backup servers is one of the features some people have
been asking for, the problem was fixed to reflect the documented
behaviour and a new option 'allbackups' was introduced to provide the
feature to those who need it.
- a never ending connect() could lead to a fast select() loop if its
timeout times the number of retransmits exceeded the server read or write
timeout, because the later was used to compute select()'s timeout while
the connection timeout was not reached.
- now we initialize the libc's localtime structures very early so that even
under OOM conditions, we can still send dated error messages without
segfaulting.
- the 'daemon' mode implies 'quiet' and disables 'verbose' because file
descriptors are closed.
2006/01/29 : 1.2.8
- fixed a nasty bug affecting poll/epoll which could return unmodified data
from the server to the client, and sometimes lead to memory corruption
crashing the process.
- added the new pause/play mechanism with SIGTTOU/SIGTTIN for hot-reconf.
2005/12/18 : 1.2.7.1
- the "retries" option was ignored because connect() could not return an
error if the connection failed before the timeout.
- TCP health-checks could not detect a connection refused in poll/epoll
mode.
2005/11/13 : 1.2.7
- building with -DUSE\_PCRE should include PCRE headers and not regex.h. At
least on Solaris, this caused the libc's regex primitives to be used instead
of PCRE, which caused trouble on group references. This is now fixed.
- delayed the quiet mode during startup so that most of the startup alerts can
be displayed even in quiet mode.
- display an alert when a listener has no address, invalid or no port, or when
there are no enabled listeners upon startup.
- added "static-pcre" to the list of supported regex options in the Makefile.
2005/10/09 : 1.2.7rc (1.1.33rc)
- second batch of socklen\_t changes.
- clean-ups from Cameron Simpson.
- because tv\_remain() does not know about eternity, using no timeout can
make select() spin around a null time-out. Bug reported by Cameron Simpson.
- client read timeout was not properly set to eternity initialized after an
accept() if it was not set in the config. It remained undetected so long
because eternity is 0 and newly allocated pages are zeroed by the system.
- do not call get\_original\_dst() when not in transparent mode.
- implemented a workaround for a bug in certain epoll() implementations on
linux-2.4 kernels (epoll-lt <= 0.21).
- implemented TCP keepalive with new options : tcpka, clitcpka, srvtcpka.
2005/08/07 : 1.2.6
- clean-up patch from Alexander Lazic fixes build on Debian 3.1 (socklen\_t).
2005/07/06 : 1.2.6-pre5 (1.1.32)
- added the number of active sessions (proxy/process) in the logs
2005/07/06 : 1.2.6-pre4 (1.1.32-pre4)
- the time-out fix introduced in 1.1.25 caused a corner case where it was
possible for a client to keep a connection maintained regardless of the
timeout if the server closed the connection during the HEADER phase,
while the client ignored the close request while doing nothing in the
other direction. This has been fixed now by ensuring that read timeouts
are re-armed when switching to any SHUTW state.
2005/07/05 : 1.2.6-pre3 (1.1.32-pre3)
- enhanced error reporting in the logs. Now the proxy will precisely detect
various error conditions related to the system and/or process limits, and
generate LOG\_EMERG logs indicating that a resource has been exhausted.
- logs will contain two new characters for the error cause : 'R' indicates
a resource exhausted, and 'I' indicates an internal error, though this
one should never happen.
- server connection timeouts can now be reported in the logs (sC), as well
as connections refused because of maxconn limitations (PC).
2005/07/05 : 1.2.6-pre2 (1.1.32-pre2)
- new global configuration keyword "ulimit-n" may be used to raise the FD
limit to usable values.
- a warning is now displayed on startup if the FD limit is lower than the
configured maximum number of sockets.
2005/07/05 : 1.2.6-pre1 (1.1.32-pre1)
- new configuration keyword "monitor-net" makes it possible to be monitored
by external devices which connect to the proxy without being logged nor
forwarded to any server. Particularly useful on generic TCPv4 relays.
2005/06/21 : 1.2.5.2
- fixed build on PPC where chars are unsigned by default
2005/05/02 : 1.2.5.1
- dirty hack to fix a bug introduced with epoll : if we close an FD and
immediately reassign it to another session through a connect(), the
Prev{Read,Write}Events are not updated, which causes trouble detecting
changes, thus leading to many timeouts at high loads.
2005/04/30 : 1.2.5 (1.1.31)
- changed the runtime argument to disable epoll() to '-de'
- changed the runtime argument to disable poll() to '-dp'
- added global options 'nopoll' and 'noepoll' to do the same at the
configuration level.
- added a 'linux24e' target to the Makefile for Linux 2.4 systems patched to
support epoll().
- changed default FD\_SETSIZE to 65536 on Solaris (default=1024)
- conditionned signals redirection to #ifdef DEBUG\_MEMORY
2005/04/26 : 1.2.5-pre4
- made epoll() support a compile-time option : ENABLE\_EPOLL
- provided a very little libc replacement for a possibly missing epoll()
implementation which can be enabled by -DUSE\_MY\_EPOLL
- implemented the poll() poller, which can be enabled with -DENABLE\_POLL.
The equivalent runtime argument becomes '-P'. A few tests show that it
performs like select() with many fds, but slightly slower (certainly
because of the higher amount of memory involved).
- separated the 3 polling methods and the tasks scheduler into 4 distinct
functions which makes the code a lot more modular.
- moved some event tables to private static declarations inside the poller
functions.
- the poller functions can now initialize themselves, run, and cleanup.
- changed the runtime argument to enable epoll() to '-E'.
- removed buggy epoll\_ctl() code in the client\_retnclose() function. This
function was never meant to remove anything.
- fixed a typo which caused glibc to yell about a double free on exit.
- removed error checking after epoll\_ctl(DEL) because we can never know if
the fd is still active or already closed.
- added a few entries in the makefile
2005/04/25 : 1.2.5-pre3
- experimental epoll() support (use temporary '-e' argument)
2005/04/24 : 1.2.5-pre2
- implemented the HTTP 303 code for error redirection. This forces the
browser to fetch the given URI with a GET request. The new keyword for
this is 'errorloc303', and a new 'errorloc302' keyword has been created
to make them easily distinguishable.
- added more controls in the parser for valid use of '\x' sequence.
- few fixes from Alex & Klaus
2005/02/17 : 1.2.5-pre1
- fixed a few errors in the documentation
2005/02/13
- do not pre-initialize unused file-descriptors before select() anymore.
2005/01/22 : 1.2.4
- merged Alexander Lazic's and Klaus Wagner's work on application
cookie-based persistence. Since this is the first merge, this version is
not intended for general use and reports are more than welcome. Some
documentation is really needed though.
2005/01/22 : 1.2.3 (1.1.30)
- add an architecture guide to the documentation
- released without any changes
2004/12/26 : 1.2.3-pre1 (1.1.30-pre1)
- increased default BUFSIZE to 16 kB to accept max headers of 8 kB which is
compatible with Apache. This limit can be configured in the makefile now.
Thanks to Eric Fehr for the checks.
- added a per-server "source" option which now makes it possible to bind to
a different source for each (potentially identical) server.
- changed cookie-based server selection slightly to allow several servers to
share a same cookie, thus making it possible to associate backup servers to
live servers and ease soft-stop for maintenance periods. (Alexander Lazic)
- added the cookie 'prefix' mode which makes it possible to use persistence
with thin clients which support only one cookie. The server name is prefixed
before the application cookie, and restore back.
- fixed the order of servers within an instance to match documentation. Now
the servers are \*really\* used in the order of their declaration. This is
particularly important when multiple backup servers are in use.
2004/10/18 : 1.2.2 (1.1.29)
- fixed a bug where a TCP connection would be logged twice if the 'logasap'
option was enabled without the 'tcplog' option.
- encode\_string() would use hdr\_encode\_map instead of the map argument.
2004/08/10 : (1.1.29-pre2)
- the logged request is now encoded with '#XX' for unprintable characters
- new keywords 'capture request header' and 'capture response header' enable
logging of arbitrary HTTP headers in requests and responses
- removed "-DSOLARIS" after replacing the last inet\_aton() with inet\_pton()
2004/06/06 : 1.2.1 (1.1.28)
- added the '-V' command line option to verbosely report errors even though
the -q or 'quiet' options are specified. This is useful with '-c'.
- added a Red Hat init script and a .spec from Simon Matter
2004/06/05 :
- added the "logasap" option which produces a log without waiting for the data
to be transferred from the server to the client.
- added the "httpclose" option which removes any "connection:" header and adds
"Connection: close" in both direction.
- added the 'checkcache' option which blocks cacheable responses containing
dangerous headers, such as 'set-cookie'.
- added 'rspdeny' and 'rspideny' to block certain responses to avoid sensible
information leak from servers.
2004/04/18 :
- send an EMERG log when no server is available for a given proxy
- added the '-c' command line option to syntactically check the
configuration file without starting the service.
2003/11/09 : 1.2.0
- the same as 1.1.27 + IPv6 support on the client side
2003/10/27 : 1.1.27
- the configurable HTTP health check introduced in 1.1.23 revealed a shameful
bug : the code still assumed that HTTP requests were the same size as the
original ones (22 bytes), and failed if they were not.
- added support for pidfiles.
2003/10/22 : 1.1.26
- the fix introduced in 1.1.25 for client timeouts while waiting for servers
broke almost all compatibility with POST requests, because the proxy
stopped to read anything from the client as soon as it got all of its
headers.
2003/10/15 : 1.1.25
- added the 'tcplog' option, which provides enhanced, HTTP-like logs for
generic TCP proxies, or lighter logs for HTTP proxies.
- fixed a time-out condition wrongly reported as client time-out in data
phase if the client timeout was lower than the connect timeout times the
number of retries.
2003/09/21 : 1.1.24
- if a client sent a full request then shut its write connection down, then
the request was aborted. This case was detected only when using haproxy
both as health-check client and as a server.
- if 'option httpchk' is used in a 'health' mode server, then responses will
change from 'OK' to 'HTTP/1.0 200 OK'.
- fixed a Linux-only bug in case of HTTP server health-checks, where a single
server response followed by a close could be ignored, and the server seen
as failed.
2003/09/19 : 1.1.23
- fixed a stupid bug introduced in 1.1.22 which caused second and subsequent
'default' sections to keep previous parameters, and not initialize logs
correctly.
- fixed a second stupid bug introduced in 1.1.22 which caused configurations
relying on 'dispatch' mode to segfault at the first connection.
- 'option httpchk' now supports method, HTTP version and a few headers.
- now, 'option httpchk', 'cookie' and 'capture' can be specified in
'defaults' section
2003/09/10 : 1.1.22
- 'listen' now supports optionnal address:port-range lists
- 'bind' introduced to add new listen addresses
- fixed a bug which caused a session to be kept established on a server till
it timed out if the client closed during the DATA phase.
- the port part of each server address can now be empty to make the proxy
connect to the server on the same port it was connected to, be an absolute
unsigned number to reflect a single port (as in older versions), or an
explicitly signed number (+N/-N) to indicate that this offset must be
applied to the port the proxy was connected to, when connecting to the
server.
- the 'port' server option allows the user to specify a different
health-check port than the service one. It is mandatory when only relative
ports have been specified and check is required. By default, the checks are
sent to the service port.
- new 'defaults' section which is rather similar to 'listen' except that all
values are only used as default values for future 'listen' sections, until
a new 'defaults' resets them. At the moment, server options, regexes,
cookie names and captures cannot be set in the 'defaults' section.
2003/05/06 : 1.1.21
- changed the debug output format so that it now includes the session unique
ID followed by the instance name at the beginning of each line.
- in debug mode, accept now shows the client's IP and port.
- added one 3 small debugging scripts to search and pretty print debug output
- changed the default health check request to "OPTIONS /" instead of
"OPTIONS \*" since not all servers implement the later one.
- "option httpchk" now accepts an optional parameter allowing the user to
specify and URI other than '/' during health-checks.
2003/04/21 : 1.1.20
- fixed two problems with time-outs, one where a server would be logged as
timed out during transfer that take longer to complete than the fixed
time-out, and one where clients were logged as timed-out during the data
phase because they didn't have anything to send. This sometimes caused
slow client connections to close too early while in fact there was no
problem. The proper fix would be to have a per-fd time-out with
conditions depending on the state of the HTTP FSM.
2003/04/16 : 1.1.19
- haproxy was NOT RFC compliant because it was case-sensitive on HTTP
"Cookie:" and "Set-Cookie:" headers. This caused JVM 1.4 to fail on
cookie persistence because it uses "cookie:". Two memcmp() have been
replaced with strncasecmp().
2003/04/02 : 1.1.18
- Haproxy can be compiled with PCRE regex instead of libc regex, by setting
REGEX=pcre on the make command line.
- HTTP health-checks now use "OPTIONS \*" instead of "OPTIONS /".
- when explicit source address binding is required, it is now also used for
health-checks.
- added 'reqpass' and 'reqipass' to allow certain headers but not the request
itself.
- factored several strings to reduce binary size by about 2 kB.
- replaced setreuid() and setregid() with more standard setuid() and setgid().
- added 4 status flags to the log line indicating who ended the connection
first, the sessions state, the validity of the cookie, and action taken on
the set-cookie header.
2002/10/18 : 1.1.17
- add the notion of "backup" servers, which are used only when all other
servers are down.
- make Set-Cookie return "" instead of "(null)" when the server has no
cookie assigned (useful for backup servers).
- "log" now supports an optionnal level name (info, notice, err ...) above
which nothing is sent.
- replaced some strncmp() with memcmp() for better efficiency.
- added "capture cookie" option which logs client and/or server cookies
- cleaned up/down messages and dump servers states upon SIGHUP
- added a redirection feature for errors : "errorloc  "
- now we won't insist on connecting to a dead server, even with a cookie,
unless option "persist" is specified.
- added HTTP/408 response for client request time-out and HTTP/50[234] for
server reply time-out or errors.
2002/09/01 : 1.1.16
- implement HTTP health checks when option "httpchk" is specified.
2002/08/07 : 1.1.15
- replaced setpgid()/setpgrp() with setsid() for better portability, because
setpgrp() doesn't have the same meaning under Solaris, Linux, and OpenBSD.
2002/07/20 : 1.1.14
- added "postonly" cookie mode
2002/07/15 : 1.1.13
- tv\_diff used inverted parameters which led to negative times !
2002/07/13 : 1.1.12
- fixed stats monitoring, and optimized some tv\_\* for most common cases.
- replaced temporary 'newhdr' with 'trash' to reduce stack size
- made HTTP errors more HTML-fiendly.
- renamed strlcpy() to strlcpy2() because of a slightly difference between
their behaviour (return value), to avoid confusion.
- restricted HTTP messages to HTTP proxies only
- added a 502 message when the connection has been refused by the server,
to prevent clients from believing this is a zero-byte HTTP 0.9 reply.
- changed 'Cache-control:' from 'no-cache="set-cookie"' to 'private' when
inserting a cookie, because some caches (apache) don't understand it.
- fixed processing of server headers when client is in SHUTR state
2002/07/04 :
- automatically close fd's 0,1 and 2 when going daemon ; setpgrp() after
setpgid()
2002/06/04 : 1.1.11
- fixed multi-cookie handling in client request to allow clean deletion
in insert+indirect mode. Now, only the server cookie is deleted and not
all the header. Should now be compliant to RFC2965.
- added a "nocache" option to "cookie" to specify that we explicitly want
to add a "cache-control" header when we add a cookie.
It is also possible to add an "Expires: " to keep compatibility
with old/broken caches.
2002/05/10 : 1.1.10
- if a cookie is used in insert+indirect mode, it's desirable that the
the servers don't see it. It was not possible to remove it correctly
with regexps, so now it's removed automatically.
2002/04/19 : 1.1.9
- don't use snprintf()'s return value as an end of message since it may
be larger. This caused bus errors and segfaults in internal libc's
getenv() during localtime() in send\_log().
- removed dead insecure send\_syslog() function and all references to it.
- fixed warnings on Solaris due to buggy implementation of isXXXX().
2002/04/18 : 1.1.8
- option "dontlognull"
- fixed "double space" bug in config parser
- fixed an uninitialized server field in case of dispatch
with no existing server which could cause a segfault during
logging.
- the pid logged was always the father's, which was wrong for daemons.
- fixed wrong level "LOG\_INFO" for message "proxy started".
2002/04/13 :
- http logging is now complete :
- ip:port, date, proxy, server
- req\_time, conn\_time, hdr\_time, tot\_time
- status, size, request
- source address
2002/04/12 : 1.1.7
- added option forwardfor
- added reqirep, reqidel, reqiallow, reqideny, rspirep, rspidel
- added "log global" in "listen" section.
2002/04/09 :
- added a new "global" section :
- logs
- debug, quiet, daemon modes
- uid, gid, chroot, nbproc, maxconn
2002/04/08 : 1.1.6
- regex are now chained and not limited anymore.
- unavailable server now returns HTTP/502.
- increased per-line args limit to 40
- added reqallow/reqdeny to block some request on matches
- added HTTP 400/403 responses
2002/04/03 : 1.1.5
- connection logging displayed incorrect source address.
- added proxy start/stop and server up/down log events.
- replaced log message short buffers with larger trash.
- enlarged buffer to 8 kB and replace buffer to 4 kB.
2002/03/25 : 1.1.4
- made rise/fall/interval time configurable
2002/03/22 : 1.1.3
- fixed a bug : cr\_expire and cw\_expire were inverted in CL\_STSHUT[WR]
which could lead to loops.
2002/03/21 : 1.1.2
- fixed a bug in buffer management where we could have a loop
between event\_read() and process\_{cli|srv} if R==BUFSIZE-MAXREWRITE.
=> implemented an adjustable buffer limit.
- fixed a bug : expiration of tasks in wait queue timeout is used again,
and running tasks are skipped.
- added some debug lines for accept events.
- send warnings for servers up/down.
2002/03/12 : 1.1.1
- fixed a bug in total failure handling
- fixed a bug in timestamp comparison within same second (tv\_cmp\_ms)
2002/03/10 : 1.1.0
- fixed a few timeout bugs
- rearranged the task scheduler subsystem to improve performance,
add new tasks, and make it easier to later port to librt ;
- allow multiple accept() for one select() wake up ;
- implemented internal load balancing with basic health-check ;
- cookie insertion and header add/replace/delete, with better strings
support.
2002/03/08
- reworked buffer handling to fix a few rewrite bugs, and
improve overall performance.
- implement the "purge" option to delete server cookies in direct mode.
2002/03/07
- fixed some error cases where the maxfd was not decreased.
2002/02/26
- now supports transparent proxying, at least on linux 2.4.
2002/02/12
- soft stop works again (fixed select timeout computation).
- it seems that TCP proxies sometimes cannot timeout.
- added a "quiet" mode.
- enforce file descriptor limitation on socket() and accept().
2001/12/30 : release of version 1.0.2 : fixed a bug in header processing
2001/12/19 : release of version 1.0.1 : no MSG\_NOSIGNAL on solaris
2001/12/16 : release of version 1.0.0.
2001/12/16 : added syslog capability for each accepted connection.
2001/11/19 : corrected premature end of files and occasional SIGPIPE.
2001/10/31 : added health-check type servers (mode health) which replies OK then closes.
2001/10/30 : added the ability to support standard TCP proxies and HTTP proxies
with or without cookies (use keyword http for this).
2001/09/01 : added client/server header replacing with regexps.
eg:
cliexp ^(Host:\ [^:]\*).\* Host:\ \1:80
srvexp ^Server:\ .\* Server:\ Apache
2000/11/29 : first fully working release with complete FSMs and timeouts.
2000/11/28 : major rewrite

# USN-1800-1: HAProxy vulnerabilities

15 April 2013

HAProxy could be made to crash or run programs if it received specially
crafted network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [haproxy](/security/cves?package=haproxy) - fast and reliable load balancing reverse proxy

## Details

It was discovered that HAProxy incorrectly handled configurations where

global.tune.bufsize was set to a value higher than the default. A remote

attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-2942](/security/CVE-2012-2942))

Yves Lafon discovered that HAProxy incorrectly handled HTTP keywords in TCP

inspection rules when HTTP keep-alive is enabled. A remote attacker could

use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2013-1912](/security/CVE-2013-1912))

# HAProxy: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **201301-02**

A buffer overflow in HAProxy may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-proxy/haproxy** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.21** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.21** |

### Background

HAProxy is a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy for high availability environments.

### Description

A boundary error in HAProxy could cause a buffer overflow when header
rewriting is enabled and the configuration sets global.tune.bufsize to a
value greater than the default (16384 bytes).

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All HAProxy users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/haproxy-1.4.21"

```
