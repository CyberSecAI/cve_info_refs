Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2882:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a "wild pointer in OGG container handling." This indicates an issue with how the OGG container format is processed, leading to a pointer being used incorrectly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Wild pointer:** The primary vulnerability is the existence of a wild pointer, likely caused by a logic error or incorrect memory management during OGG parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The content does not specify the exact impact of the vulnerability, but wild pointer issues often lead to:
    - Memory corruption
    - Program crashes
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution in some scenarios

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a malformed OGG file. An attacker would need to deliver a crafted OGG file to the vulnerable software (Chromium) to trigger the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious OGG file to the target. This could be achieved through:
    - Embedding the OGG file on a website.
    - Tricking the user into opening the file.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is related to issue 140647 in the Chromium bug tracker.
- The fix was part of a larger update to address multiple security flaws in Chromium.
- The vulnerability was found and credited to Google Chrome Security Team (Inferno).
- The provided commit log for the FFmpeg update lists the following as a fix: 
    - "oggdec: check stream index before using it in ogg_get_length()"
    - This likely is the root cause of the vulnerability, as a missing check on the stream index could lead to accessing invalid memory locations via the wild pointer

The provided information indicates this was a High severity issue.
