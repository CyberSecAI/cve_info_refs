  "CVE-2012-2625": {
    "description": "The xen packages contain administration tools and the xend service for managing the kernel-xen kernel for virtualization on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the pyGrub boot loader handled compressed kernel images. A privileged guest user in a para-virtualized guest (a DomU) could use this flaw to create a crafted kernel image that, when attempting to boot it, could result in an out-of-memory condition in the privileged domain (the Dom0).",

     "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is related to CVE-2012-4544, which covers a similar issue in the Xen domain builder. Also note that using pvgrub instead of pygrub mitigates the issue, as builder will run in guest context.\nThis issue was publicly discussed in various places, including <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-2625> and <http://bugs.debian.org/688125>."
