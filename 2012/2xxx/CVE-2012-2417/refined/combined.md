(thanks: Legrandin)
 In the ElGamal schemes (for both encryption and signatures), g is supposed to be the generator of the entire Z^\*\_p group. However, in PyCrypto 2.5 and earlier, g is more simply the generator of a random sub-group of Z^\*\_p.
 The result is that the signature space (when the key is used for signing) or the public key space (when the key is used for encryption) may be greatly reduced from its expected size of log(p) bits, possibly down to 1 bit (the worst case if the order of g is 2).
 While it has not been confirmed, it has also been suggested that an attacker might be able to use this fact to determine the private key.
 Anyone using ElGamal keys should generate new keys as soon as practical.
 Any additional information about this bug will be tracked at https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/985164
 \* Huge documentation cleanup (thanks: Legrandin).
 \* Added more tests, including test vectors from NIST 800-38A (thanks: Legrandin)
 \* Remove broken MODE\_PGP, which never actually worked properly. A new mode, MODE\_OPENPGP, has been added for people wishing to write OpenPGP implementations. Note that this does not implement the full OpenPGP specification, only the "OpenPGP CFB mode" part of that specification. https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/996814
 \* Fix: getPrime with invalid input causes Python to abort with fatal error https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/988431
 \* Fix: Segfaults within error-handling paths (thanks: Paul Howarth & Dave Malcolm) https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/934294
 \* Fix: Block ciphers allow empty string as IV https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/997464
 \* Fix DevURandomRNG to work with Python3's new I/O stack. (thanks: Sebastian Ramacher)
 \* Remove automagic dependencies on libgmp and libmpir, let the caller disable them using args.
 \* Many other minor bug fixes and improvements (mostly thanks to Legrandin)
2.5=== \* Added PKCS#1 encryption schemes (v1.5 and OAEP). We now have a decent, easy-to-use non-textbook RSA implementation. Yay!
 \* Added PKCS#1 signature schemes (v1.5 and PSS). v1.5 required some extensive changes to Hash modules to contain the algorithm specific ASN.1 OID. To that end, we now always have a (thin) Python module to hide the one in pure C.
 \* Added 2 standard Key Derivation Functions (PBKDF1 and PBKDF2).
 \* Added export/import of RSA keys in OpenSSH and PKCS#8 formats.
 \* Added password-protected export/import of RSA keys (one old method for PKCS#8 PEM only).
 \* Added ability to generate RSA key pairs with configurable public exponent e.
 \* Added ability to construct an RSA key pair even if only the private exponent d is known, and not p and q.
 \* Added SHA-2 C source code (fully from Lorenz Quack).
 \* Unit tests for all the above.
 \* Updates to documentation (both inline and in Doc/pycrypt.rst)
 \* All of the above changes were put together by Legrandin (Thanks!)
 \* Minor bug fixes (setup.py and tests).
2.4.1===== \* Fix "error: Setup script exited with error: src/config.h: No such file or directory" when installing via easy\_install. (Sebastian Ramacher)
2.4=== \* Python 3 support! (Thorsten E. Behrens, Anders Sundman) PyCrypto now supports every version of Python from 2.1 through 3.2.
 \* Timing-attack countermeasures in \_fastmath: When built against libgmp version 5 or later, we use mpz\_powm\_sec instead of mpz\_powm. This should prevent the timing attack described by Geremy Condra at PyCon 2011: http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-through-the-side-channel-timing-and-implementation-attacks-in-python-4897955
 \* New hash modules (for Python >= 2.5 only): SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512 (Frédéric Bertolus)
 \* Configuration using GNU autoconf. This should help fix a bunch of build issues.
 \* Support using MPIR as an alternative to GMP.
 \* Improve the test command in setup.py, by allowing tests to be performed on a single sub-package or module only. (Legrandin)
 You can now do something like this:
 python setup.py test -m Hash.SHA256 --skip-slow-tests
 \* Fix double-decref of "counter" when Cipher object initialisation fails (Ryan Kelly)
 \* Apply patches from Debian's python-crypto 2.3-3 package (Jan Dittberner, Sebastian Ramacher): - fix-RSA-generate-exception.patch - epydoc-exclude-introspect.patch - no-usr-local.patch
 \* Fix launchpad bug #702835: "Import key code is not compatible with GMP library" (Legrandin)
 \* More tests, better documentation, various bugfixes.
2.3=== \* Fix NameError when attempting to use deprecated getRandomNumber() function.
 \* \_slowmath: Compute RSA u parameter when it's not given to RSA.construct. This makes \_slowmath behave the same as \_fastmath in this regard.
 \* Make RSA.generate raise a more user-friendly exception message when the user tries to generate a bogus-length key.
2.2===
 \* Deprecated Crypto.Util.number.getRandomNumber(), which had confusing semantics. It's been replaced by getRandomNBitInteger and getRandomInteger. (Thanks: Lorenz Quack)
 \* Better isPrime() and getPrime() implementations that do a real Rabin-Miller probabilistic primality test (not the phony test we did before with fixed bases). (Thanks: Lorenz Quack)
 \* getStrongPrime() implementation for generating RSA primes. (Thanks: Lorenz Quack)
 \* Support for importing and exporting RSA keys in DER and PEM format. (Thanks: Legrandin)
 \* Fix PyCrypto when floor division (python -Qnew) is enabled.
 \* When building using gcc, use -std=c99 for compilation. This should fix building on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
2.1.0=====
 \* Fix building PyCrypto on Win64 using MS Visual Studio 9. (Thanks: Nevins Bartolomeo.)
2.1.0beta1==========
 \* Modified RSA.generate() to ensure that e is coprime to p-1 and q-1. Apparently, RSA.generate was capable of generating unusable keys.
2.1.0alpha2===========
 \* Modified isPrime() to release the global interpreter lock while performing computations. (patch from Lorenz Quack)
 \* Release the GIL while encrypting, decrypting, and hashing (but not during initialization or finalization).
 \* API changes:
 - Removed RandomPoolCompat and made Crypto.Util.randpool.RandomPool a wrapper around Crypto.Random that emits a DeprecationWarning. This is to discourage developers from attempting to provide backwards compatibility for systems where there are NO strong entropy sources available.
 - Added Crypto.Random.get\_random\_bytes(). This should allow people to use something like this if they want backwards-compatibility:
 try: from Crypto.Random import get\_random\_bytes except ImportError: try: from os import urandom as get\_random\_bytes except ImportError: get\_random\_bytes = open("/dev/urandom", "rb").read
 - Implemented \_\_ne\_\_() on pubkey, which fixes the following broken behaviour: >>> pk.publickey() == pk.publickey() True >>> pk.publickey() != pk.publickey() True (patch from Lorenz Quack)
 - Block ciphers created with MODE\_CTR can now operate on strings of any size, rather than just multiples of the underlying cipher's block size.
 - Crypto.Util.Counter objects now raise OverflowError when they wrap around to zero. You can override this new behaviour by passing allow\_wraparound=True to Counter.new()
2.1.0alpha1===========
 \* This version supports Python versions 2.1 through 2.6.
 \* Clarified copyright status of much of the existing code by tracking down Andrew M. Kuchling, Barry A. Warsaw, Jeethu Rao, Joris Bontje, Mark Moraes, Paul Swartz, Robey Pointer, and Wim Lewis and getting their permission to clarify the license/public-domain status of their contributions. Many thanks to all involved!
 \* Replaced the test suite with a new, comprehensive package (Crypto.SelfTest) that includes documentation about where its test vectors came from, or how they were derived.
 Use "python setup.py test" to run the tests after building.
 \* API changes:
 - Added Crypto.version\_info, which from now on will contain version information in a format similar to Python's sys.version\_info.
 - Added a new random numbers API (Crypto.Random), and deprecated the old one (Crypto.Util.randpool.RandomPool), which was misused more often than not.
 The new API is used by invoking Crypto.Random.new() and then just reading from the file-like object that is returned.
 CAVEAT: To maintain the security of the PRNG, you must call Crypto.Random.atfork() in both the parent and the child processes whenever you use os.fork(). Otherwise, the parent and child will share copies of the same entropy pool, causing them to return the same results! This is a limitation of Python, which does not provide readily-accessible hooks to os.fork(). It's also a limitation caused by the failure of operating systems to provide sufficiently fast, trustworthy sources of cryptographically-strong random numbers.
 - Crypto.PublicKey now raises ValueError/TypeError/RuntimeError instead of the various custom "error" exceptions
 - Removed the IDEA and RC5 modules due to software patents. Debian has been doing this for a while
 - Added Crypto.Random.random, a strong version of the standard Python 'random' module.
 - Added Crypto.Util.Counter, providing fast counter implementations for use with CTR-mode ciphers.
 \* Bug fixes:
 - Fixed padding bug in SHA256; this resulted in bad digests whenever (the number of bytes hashed) mod 64 == 55.
 - Fixed a 32-bit limitation on the length of messages the SHA256 module could hash.
 - AllOrNothing: Fixed padding bug in digest()
 - Fixed a bad behaviour of the XOR cipher module: It would silently truncate all keys to 32 bytes. Now it raises ValueError when the key is too long.
 - DSA: Added code to enforce FIPS 186-2 requirements on the size of the prime p
 - Fixed the winrandom module, which had been omitted from the build process, causing security problems for programs that misuse RandomPool.
 - Fixed infinite loop when attempting to generate RSA keys with an odd number of bits in the modulus. (Not that you should do that.)
 \* Clarified the documentation for Crypto.Util.number.getRandomNumber.
 Confusingly, this function does NOT return N random bits; It returns a random N-bit number, i.e. a random number between 2\*\*(N-1) and (2\*\*N)-1.
 Note that getRandomNumber is for internal use only and may be renamed or removed in future releases.
 \* Replaced RIPEMD.c with a new implementation (RIPEMD160.c) to alleviate copyright concerns.
 \* Replaced the DES/DES3 modules with ones based on libtomcrypt-1.16 to alleviate copyright concerns.
 \* Replaced Blowfish.c with a new implementation to alleviate copyright concerns.
 \* Added a string-XOR implementation written in C (Crypto.Util.strxor) and used it to speed up Crypto.Hash.HMAC
 \* Converted documentation to reStructured Text.
 \* Added epydoc configuration Doc/epydoc-config
 \* setup.py now emits a warning when building without GMP.
 \* Added pct-speedtest.py to the source tree for doing performance testing on the new code.
 \* Cleaned up the code in several places.
2.0.1=====
 \* Fix SHA256 and RIPEMD on AMD64 platform. \* Deleted Demo/ directory. \* Add PublicKey to Crypto.\_\_all\_\_
2.0===
 \* Added SHA256 module contributed by Jeethu Rao, with test data from Taylor Boon.
 \* Fixed AES.c compilation problems with Borland C.  (Contributed by Jeethu Rao.)
 \* Fix ZeroDivisionErrors on Windows, caused by the system clock not having enough resolution.  \* Fix 2.1/2.2-incompatible use of (key not in dict), pointed out by Ian Bicking.
 \* Fix FutureWarning in Crypto.Util.randpool, noted by James P Rutledge.
 1.9alpha6=========
 \* Util.number.getPrime() would inadvertently round off the bit size; if you asked for a 129-bit prime or 135-bit prime, you got a 128-bit prime.
 \* Added Util/test/prime\_speed.py to measure the speed of prime generation, and PublicKey/test/rsa\_speed.py to measure the speed of RSA operations.
 \* Merged the \_rsa.c and \_dsa.c files into a single accelerator module, \_fastmath.c.
 \* Speed improvements: Added fast isPrime() function to \_fastmath, cutting the time to generate a 1024-bit prime by a factor of 10. Optimized the C version of RSA decryption to use a longer series of operations that's roughly 3x faster than a single exponentiation. (Contributed by Joris Bontje.)
 \* Added support to RSA key objects for blinding and unblinding  data. (Contributed by Joris Bontje.)
 \* Simplified RSA key generation: hard-wired the encryption exponent to 65537 instead of generating a random prime; generate prime factors in a loop until the product  is large enough.  \* Renamed cansign(), canencrypt(), hasprivate(), to  can\_sign, can\_encrypt, has\_private. If people shriek about this change very loudly, I'll add aliases for the old method names that log a warning and call the new method.
1.9alpha5=========
 \* Many randpool changes. RandomPool now has a randomize(N:int) method that can be called to get N bytes of entropy for the pool (N defaults to 0, which 'fills up' the pool's entropy) KeyboardRandom overloads this method.
 \* Added src/winrand.c for Crypto.Util.winrandom and now use winrandom for \_randomize if possible. (Calls Windows CryptoAPI CryptGenRandom)
 \* Several additional places for stirring the pool, capturing inter-event entropy when reading/writing, stirring before and after saves.
 \* RandomPool.add\_event now returns the number of estimated bits of added entropy, rather than the pool entropy itself (since the pool entropy is capped at the number of bits in the pool)
 \* Moved termios code from KeyboardRandomPool into a KeyboardEntry class, provided a version for Windows using msvcrt.
 \* Fix randpool.py crash on machines with poor timer resolution. (Reported by Mark Moraes and others.)
 \* If the GNU GMP library is available, two C extensions will be  compiled to speed up RSA and DSA operations. (Contributed by  Paul Swartz.)
 \* DES3 with a 24-byte key was broken; now fixed.  (Patch by Philippe Frycia.)
1.9alpha4=========
 \* Fix compilation problem on Windows.
 \* HMAC.py fixed to work with pre-2.2 Pythons  \* setup.py now dies if built with Python 1.x
1.9alpha3=========
 \* Fix a ref-counting bug that caused core dumps.  (Reported by Piers Lauder and an anonymous SF poster.)
1.9alpha2=========
 \* (Backwards incompatible) The old Crypto.Hash.HMAC module is gone, replaced by a copy of hmac.py from Python 2.2's standard library. It will display a warning on interpreter versions older than 2.2.  \* (Backwards incompatible) Restored the Crypto.Protocol package, and modernized and tidied up the two modules in it, AllOrNothing.py and Chaffing.py, renaming various methods and changing the interface.  \* (Backwards incompatible) Changed the function names in Crypto.Util.RFC1751.  \* Restored the Crypto.PublicKey package at user request. I think I'll leave it in the package and warn about it in the documentation. I hope that eventually I can point to someone else's better public-key code, and at that point I may insert warnings and begin the process of deprecating this code.
 \* Fix use of a Python 2.2 C function, replacing it with a  2.1-compatible equivalent. (Bug report and patch by Andrew Eland.)
 \* Fix endianness bugs that caused test case failures on Sparc, PPC, and doubtless other platforms.
 \* Fixed compilation problem on FreeBSD and MacOS X.  \* Expanded the test suite (requires Sancho, from  http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/sancho/)
 \* Added lots of docstrings, so 'pydoc Crypto' now produces  helpful output. (Open question: maybe \*all\* of the documentation should be moved into docstrings?)  \* Make test.py automatically add the build/\* directory to sys.path.
 \* Removed 'inline' declaration from C functions. Some compilers don't support it, and Python's pyconfig.h no longer tells you whether it's supported or not. After this change, some ciphers got slower, but others got faster.  \* The C-level API has been changed to reduce the amount of memory-to-memory copying. This makes the code neater, but  had ambiguous performance effects; again, some ciphers got slower and others became faster. Probably this is due to my compiler optimizing slightly worse or better as a result.
 \* Moved C source implementations into src/ from block/, hash/,  and stream/. Having Hash/ and hash/ directories causes problems on case-insensitive filesystems such as Mac OS.
 \* Cleaned up the C code for the extensions.  1.9alpha1=========
 \* Added Crypto.Cipher.AES.
 \* Added the CTR mode and the variable-sized CFB mode from the NIST standard on feedback modes.   \* Removed Diamond, HAVAL, MD5, Sapphire, SHA, and Skipjack. MD5 and SHA are included with Python; the others are all of marginal usefulness in the real world.
 \* Renamed the module-level constants ECB, CFB, &c., to MODE\_ECB, MODE\_CFB, as part of making the block encryption modules  compliant with PEP 272. (I'm not sure about this change; if enough users complain about it, I might back it out.)  \* Made the hashing modules compliant with PEP 247 (not backward compatible -- the major changes are that the constructor is now  MD2.new and not MD2.MD2, and the size of the digest is now  given as 'digest\_size', not 'digestsize'.
 \* The Crypto.PublicKey package is no longer installed; the interfaces are all wrong, and I have no idea what the right interfaces should be.
1.1alpha2========= \* Most importantly, the distribution has been broken into twoparts: exportable, and export-controlled. The exportable partcontains all the hashing algorithms, signature-only public keyalgorithms, chaffing & winnowing, random number generation, variousutility modules, and the documentation.
 The export-controlled part contains public-key encryptionalgorithms such as RSA and ElGamal, and bulk encryption algorithmslike DES, IDEA, or Skipjack. Getting this code still requires thatyou go through an access control CGI script, and denies you access ifyou're outside the US or Canada.
 \* Added the RIPEMD hashing algorithm. (Contributed byHirendra Hindocha.)
 \* Implemented the recently declassified Skipjack blockencryption algorithm. My implementation runs at 864 K/sec on aPII/266, which isn't particularly fast, but you're probably better offusing another algorithm anyway. :)
 \* A simple XOR cipher has been added, mostly for use by thechaffing/winnowing code. (Contributed by Barry Warsaw.)
 \* Added Protocol.Chaffing and Hash.HMAC.py. (Contributed byBarry Warsaw.)
 Protocol.Chaffing implements chaffing and winnowing, recentlyproposed by R. Rivest, which hides a message (the wheat) by addingmany noise messages to it (the chaff). The chaff can be discarded bythe receiver through a message authentication code. The neat thingabout this is that it allows secret communication without actuallyhaving an encryption algorithm, and therefore this falls within theexportable subset.
 \* Tidied up randpool.py, and removed its use of a blockcipher; this makes it work with only the export-controlled subsetavailable.
 \* Various renamings and reorganizations, mostly internal.
 1.0.2=====
 \* Changed files to work with Python 1.5; everything has beenre-arranged into a hierarchical package. (Not backward compatible.)The package organization is:Crypto. Hash. MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA, HAVAL Cipher. ARC2, ARC4, Blowfish, CAST, DES, DES3, Diamond,  IDEA, RC5, Sapphire PublicKey. DSA, ElGamal, qNEW, RSA Util. number, randpool, RFC1751
 Since this is backward-incompatible anyway, I also changedmodule names from all lower-case to mixed-case: diamond -> Diamond,rc5 -> RC5, etc. That had been an annoying inconsistency for a while.  \* Added CAST5 module contributed by <wiml@hhhh.org>.
 \* Added qNEW digital signature algorithm (from the digisign.pyI advertised a while back). (If anyone would like to suggest newalgorithms that should be implemented, please do; I think I've goteverything that's really useful at the moment, but...)
 \* Support for keyword arguments has been added. This allowedremoving the obnoxious key handling for Diamond and RC5, where thefirst few bytes of the key indicated the number of rounds to use, andvarious other parameters. Now you need only do something like:
from Crypto.Cipher import RC5obj = RC5.new(key, RC5.ECB, rounds=8)
(Not backward compatible.)
 \* Various function names have been changed, and parameternames altered. None of these were part of the public interface, so itshouldn't really matter much.
 \* Various bugs fixed, the test suite has been expanded, andthe build process simplified.
 \* Updated the documentation accordingly.
 1.0.1=====  \* Changed files to work with Python 1.4 .
 \* The DES and DES3 modules now automatically correct theparity of their keys.  \* Added R. Rivest's DES test (see http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/destest.txt)
1.0.0=====
 \* REDOC III succumbed to differential cryptanalysis, and hasbeen removed.
 \* The crypt and rotor modules have been dropped; they're stillavailable in the standard Python distribution.
 \* The Ultra-Fast crypt() module has been placed in a separatedistribution.
 \* Various bugs fixed.

### Bug Description

In the ElGamal schemes (for both encryption and signatures), g is supposed to be the generator of the entire Z^\*\_p group.

However, in the current implementation, g is more simply the generator of a random sub-group of Z^\*\_p.

The order of such sub-group may be smaller than p-1, and since there are not constraints or checks on the factorization of p-1, the order may be \*much\* smaller than what it should be.

To say, if I limit the bit size to 8 bits, I get p=211 and g=107. The order of g is 42, much less than the expected (and "secure") 210!

Thanks for this. Do you know if there is a way to take an existing key and find out whether it has this problem? (Even better, to compute the order of the sub-group?)

Also, given that this is a \*random\* sub-group, does this actually help an attacker? I'm going to fix this anyway, but I want to get an understanding of how bad this is. I don't know much about ElGamal encryption.

> Do you know if there is a way to take an existing key and find out whether it has this problem? (Even better, to compute the order of the sub-group?)

One way is to factor p-1 and find all its divisors. The divisors are also all the possible orders a sub-group of Zp can have.

The generator g is safe (with respect to this problem) if g^d mod p is not 1 for all divisors other than p-1.

That may not be enough though: when the key is used for signing, one should also check that g and g^{-1} don't divide p-1 (see patch). Those are at least the additional contraints I have found so far for the key...

> Also, given that this is a \*random\* sub-group, does this actually help an attacker? I'm going to fix this anyway, but I want to get an understanding of how bad this is. I don't know much about ElGamal encryption.

g is also made public, so that would be only relevant if the attack was based on some precomputation I think. The main problem I see is that the signature space (when the key is used for signing) or the public key space (when the key is used for encryption) may be greatly reduced from log(p) bits down to up 1 bit (worst case if the order of g is 2). That's already bad enough, but it could be that such fact may also be used to work out the private key (which the RFC you have found seem to imply).

> Is it okay if I just merge your entire tree (up to 6f312637208cc70b231892109564e2aebc92728a)?

I can submit a complete/tested/polished set of changes in one week time. As you can guess, the changes are mostly about improving documentation of the public key module: right now, qnew and maybe pycrypt.rst are still missing. I run into this problem by reviewing the Elgamal code.

How can the user know whether they have an ElGamal key generated by the vulnerable versions of PyCrypto? For example, it is not stated in USN-1484-1 whether this library is used by Seahorse. The security notice also did not specify that users should replace the potentially-vulnerable keys. Even more disappointing, the notice states that "The problem can be corrected by updating your system..." Well, the software may be fixed, but the potentially-insecure keys are not magically made more secure by upgrading PyCrypto.

CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2417

It was discovered that that the ElGamal code in PythonCrypto, a
collection of cryptographic algorithms and protocols for Python used
insecure insufficient prime numbers in key generation, which lead to a
weakened signature or public key space, allowing easier brute force
attacks on such keys.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-crypto packages. After
installing this update, previously generated keys need to be regenerated.

Thanks for this. Do you know if there is a way to take an existing key and find out whether it has this problem? (Even better, to compute the order of the sub-group?)

Also, given that this is a \*random\* sub-group, does this actually help an attacker? I'm going to fix this anyway, but I want to get an understanding of how bad this is. I don't know much about ElGamal encryption.

Is it okay if I just merge your entire tree (up to 6f312637208cc70b231892109564e2aebc92728a)?

> Do you know if there is a way to take an existing key and find out whether it has this problem? (Even better, to compute the order of the sub-group?)

One way is to factor p-1 and find all its divisors. The divisors are also all the possible orders a sub-group of Zp can have.

The generator g is safe (with respect to this problem) if g^d mod p is not 1 for all divisors other than p-1.

That may not be enough though: when the key is used for signing, one should also check that g and g^{-1} don't divide p-1 (see patch). Those are at least the additional contraints I have found so far for the key...

> Also, given that this is a \*random\* sub-group, does this actually help an attacker? I'm going to fix this anyway, but I want to get an understanding of how bad this is. I don't know much about ElGamal encryption.

g is also made public, so that would be only relevant if the attack was based on some precomputation I think. The main problem I see is that the signature space (when the key is used for signing) or the public key space (when the key is used for encryption) may be greatly reduced from log(p) bits down to up 1 bit (worst case if the order of g is 2). That's already bad enough, but it could be that such fact may also be used to work out the private key (which the RFC you have found seem to imply).

> Is it okay if I just merge your entire tree (up to 6f312637208cc70b231892109564e2aebc92728a)?

I can submit a complete/tested/polished set of changes in one week time. As you can guess, the changes are mostly about improving documentation of the public key module: right now, qnew and maybe pycrypt.rst are still missing. I run into this problem by reviewing the Elgamal code.

How can the user know whether they have an ElGamal key generated by the vulnerable versions of PyCrypto? For example, it is not stated in USN-1484-1 whether this library is used by Seahorse. The security notice also did not specify that users should replace the potentially-vulnerable keys. Even more disappointing, the notice states that "The problem can be corrected by updating your system..." Well, the software may be fixed, but the potentially-insecure keys are not magically made more secure by upgrading PyCrypto.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE-2012-2417 - PyCrypto <= 2.5 insecure ElGamal key generation

CVE-2012-2417 [https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/+bug/985164](https://bugs.launchpad.net/pycrypto/%2Bbug/985164)

PyCrypto (also known as python-crypto) versions 2.5 and earlier implement
incorrect ElGamal key generation.  The bug has been fixed in PyCrypto
2.6, which was released this morning.  Details below:

     In the ElGamal schemes (for both encryption and signatures), g is
     supposed to be the generator of the entire Z^*_p group. However, in
     PyCrypto 2.5 and earlier, g is more simply the generator of a random
     sub-group of Z^*_p.

     The result is that the signature space (when the key is used for
     signing) or the public key space (when the key is used for encryption)
     may be greatly reduced from its expected size of log(p) bits, possibly
     down to 1 bit (the worst case if the order of g is 2).

     While it has not been confirmed, it has also been suggested that an
     attacker might be able to use this fact to determine the private key.

Anyone using ElGamal keys should generate new keys as soon as practical.

Any additional information about this bug will be tracked at the above URL.
