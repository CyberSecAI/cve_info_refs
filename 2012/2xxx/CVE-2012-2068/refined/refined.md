Scripting (XSS)","<https://drupal.org/node/1482744>"
```

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-2068

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Drupal Fancy Slide module

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Fancy Slide module for Drupal is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The module does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
   - Session hijacking
   - Defacement of the website
   - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
   - Theft of sensitive information
   - Redirection to malicious sites

**Attack vectors:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the vulnerable input fields or settings of the Fancy Slide module. This injected code is then executed when a user views the content containing the slide.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to submit content through the Fancy Slide module or manipulate the configuration of the module. The attacker does not need access to the server or a user's session; they can target users directly via the website.
