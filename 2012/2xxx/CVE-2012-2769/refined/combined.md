We have determined a number of security vulnerabilities in commonly
installed RT extensions, enumerated below.  You can determine which, if
any, of these extensions your RT installation is using by navigating to
Configuration -> Tools -> System Configuration, and examining the
"Plugins" configuration setting.

We have released updated versions of each vulnerable extension.
Installation instructions for each are included in a README file in each
extension's tarball.  You need only download and upgrade these
extensions if you have a previous version of them installed; RT
installations with none of the below extensions installed are not
vulnerable, and do not need to take action.

RT::Authen::ExternalAuth 0.10 and below (for all versions of RT) are
vulnerable to an escalation of privilege attack where the URL of a RSS
feed of the user can be used to acquire a fully logged-in session as
that user.  CVE-2012-2770 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Users of RT 3.8.2 and above should upgrade to RT::Authen::ExternalAuth
0.11, which resolves this vulnerability.  Because users of RT 3.8.1
cannot run RT::Authen::ExternalAuth later then 0.08 (due to bugs in
plugin handling code in RT 3.8.1), we are also providing a patch which
applies to RT::Authen::ExternalAuth 0.08.  This patch should only be
applied if you are running RT 3.8.1 and RT::Authen::ExternalAuth 0.08.
Instructions for applying the patch can be found in the patch file
itself.

RT::FM versions 2.0.4 through 2.4.3, inclusive, are vulnerable to
multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in the topic administration
page.  CVE-2012-2768 has been assigned to this vulnerability.  This
release also includes updates for compatibility with RT 3.8.12.  As RT
4.0 and above bundle RT::FM's functionality, and resolved this
vulnerability in RT 4.0.6, this update is only applicable to
installations of RT 3.8.

RT::Extension::MobileUI 1.01 and below are vulnerable to multiple
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.  CVE-2012-2769 has been assigned to
this vulnerability.  As RT 4.0 and above bundle
RT::Extension::MobileUI's functionality, and resolved this vulnerability
in RT 4.0.6, this update is only applicable to installations of RT 3.8.

extension.  If you need help resolving this issue locally, we will

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
