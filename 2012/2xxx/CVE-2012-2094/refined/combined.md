# refreshing in log viewer interprets html and javascript

Bug #977944 reported by
[J. Daniel Schmidt](https://launchpad.net/~jdsn)
on 2012-04-10

[270](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 2 people

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon) | Fix Released | Critical | Unassigned | [OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) 2012.2 "folsom"](https://launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bmilestone/2012.2) |
|  | [Essex](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/essex) | Fix Released | Critical | Unassigned | [OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) 2012.1.1](https://launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bmilestone/2012.1.1) |

### Bug Description

In the log viewer the refreshing mechanism does not escape the fetched log data.

This means that HTML with Javascript code gets interpreted as such and thus code can be injected in a dashboard session.

A harmless test for this is this command run inside a VM:

# echo "<b>test</b>" > /dev/ttyS0

This opens up even more creativity:

# echo "<script>alert('test foobar')</script>" > /dev/ttyS0

After loading the log you just have to wait (a few seconds) for the first refresh.

Thanks for your report, jdsn.

In other words this is a Cross-Site Scripting flaw which could be used to steal the session id of the logged in user viewing the logs.

I would recommend getting a CVE for it if this affects released products / software.

Robert, I agree with you. I will take care and get us one.

Since I have found the issue I guess according to the unwritten rule I have to suggest a CRD / disclosing date. Would 2012/04/20? be acceptable?

Subscribed Horizon PTL to the bug.

For reference, here is the process we follow for vulnerability management in OpenStack: <http://wiki.openstack.org/VulnerabilityManagement>

I'd like to hold off on deciding on a CRD until we're ready to send out an advance notification of the issue. Next steps:

1) We will need a patch for both master and stable/essex. I suspect that the same patch will apply fine to both in this case.

2) The patch(es) need to be pre-approved on this bug by two members of horizon-core. Devin, can you handle that?

3) Once all of that is done, we can decide on a CRD and one of the VMT members can send out the advance notification. (I don't mind doing it.)

Thanks! Can you help clarify the scope of the vulnerability? What all is this log viewer used for? Is it just for viewing output from VM consoles? Anything more than that?

Regarding the CRD (coordinated release date), I would normally propose a day next week. Given that a significant portion of the people responsible for getting the patch merged or updating packages will be busy at the OpenStack conference, we could do it 2 weeks out: Tuesday, April 24th. Would you consider this critical enough that we just do what it takes to get it released next week? If so, I'd say Tuesday, April 17th. I'm fine either way.

Hi Russel, you are correct - the log viewer allows you to tail the logs of the guest consoles.

+2 on the fix, it looks good.

Agree on the earlier release date. This is absolutely critical, since it can relatively easily be exploited to gain administrator privileges in many cases.

Actually this bug needs 6621 (which is the backport of 6618)... but that needs the equivalent of \*6626\* (not 6676) being present in the branch before it can hit.

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2012-004
CVE: 2012-2094
Date: April 17, 2012
Title: XSS vulnerability in Horizon log viewer
Impact: High
Reporter: Matthias Weckbecker <mweckbecker@xxxxxxx>
Products: Horizon
Affects: All versions

Description:
Matthias Weckbecker reported a vulnerability in Horizon. He noted that
the log viewer refreshing mechanism does not escape the data fetched
from guest consoles. This means that HTML with Javascript code gets
interpreted as such, resulting in the ability to inject code into a
dashboard session.

Fixes:
  Folsom: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/6618/>
  2012.1: <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/6621/>

# USN-1439-1: Horizon vulnerabilities

7 May 2012

Horizon could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [horizon](/security/cves?package=horizon) - Web interface for OpenStack cloud infrastructure

## Details

Matthias Weckbecker discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability

in Horizon via the log viewer refrash mechanism. If a user were tricked

into viewing a specially crafted log message, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents or steal confidential data within the

same domain. ([CVE-2012-2094](/security/CVE-2012-2094))

Thomas Biege discovered a session fixation vulnerability in Horizon. An

attacker could exploit this to potentially allow access to unauthorized

information and capabilities. ([CVE-2012-2144](/security/CVE-2012-2144))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [python-django-horizon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/horizon)
  -
  [2012.1-0ubuntu8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/horizon/2012.1-0ubuntu8.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## References

* [CVE-2012-2094](/security/CVE-2012-2094)
* [CVE-2012-2144](/security/CVE-2012-2144)

### Join the discussion

* [Security announcements mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-security-announce)

### Need help with your security needs?

Ubuntu Pro provides up to ten-year security coverage for over 23,000 open-source packages within the Ubuntu Main and Universe repositories.
