Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Horizon log viewer's mechanism for refreshing logs. The log viewer did not properly escape fetched log data from guest consoles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The log viewer interprets HTML and JavaScript code within the log data, leading to the possibility of code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into a dashboard session through specially crafted log messages.
*   **Session Hijacking:** This can lead to stealing the session ID of the logged-in user, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the dashboard.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, exploitation could lead to gaining administrator privileges.
*   **Data Modification/Theft:** Remote attackers could modify the contents or steal confidential data within the same domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker needs to inject malicious code into the logs of a guest console. This can be done by a user with access to the console of a virtual machine.
*   A user with access to the dashboard would then need to view these logs in the log viewer. The malicious code would then be executed when the log viewer refreshes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to write to a guest console's log. This typically requires the ability to execute commands within a virtual machine.
*   The attacker does not require administrator access to the Horizon dashboard itself, only the guest machine's console.
*   A user of the Horizon dashboard must view the affected log to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Matthias Weckbecker.
*   The fix involves ensuring that log data is treated as plain text and not interpreted as HTML or JavaScript.
*   Patches were created for both the master and stable/essex branches of Horizon.
*   The coordinated release date (CRD) was set for April 17th, 2012.
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Horizon.
*   Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-1439-1) addresses this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in `horizon` package version `2012.1-0ubuntu8.1` in Ubuntu 12.04.
