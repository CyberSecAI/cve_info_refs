```
Root cause of vulnerability:
Cumin used the random.getrandbits() function to generate session keys, which relies on the Mersenne Twister algorithm that leaks state and can become predictable.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Generation of weak session keys, making them potentially predictable.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote attackers could predict session keys and gain unauthorized access to Cumin.

Attack vectors:
- Remote network access to the Cumin service

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to make network requests to the Cumin web interface.
- No authentication required to attempt exploitation.
