## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1281)

## Topic

Updated Grid component packages that fix several security issues, add
various enhancements and fix multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

A number of unprotected resources (web pages, export functionality, image
viewing) were found in Cumin. An unauthenticated user could bypass intended
access restrictions, resulting in information disclosure. (CVE-2012-2680)

Cumin could generate weak session keys, potentially allowing remote
attackers to predict session keys and obtain unauthorized access to Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2681)

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws in Cumin could allow remote attackers
to inject arbitrary web script on a web page displayed by Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2683)

An SQL injection flaw in Cumin could allow remote attackers to manipulate
the contents of the back-end database via a specially-crafted URL.
(CVE-2012-2684)

When Cumin handled image requests, clients could request images of
arbitrary sizes. This could result in large memory allocations on the Cumin
server, leading to an out-of-memory condition. (CVE-2012-2685)

Cumin did not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. If an
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the Cumin web interface,
into visiting a specially-crafted web page, it could lead to unauthorized
command execution in the Cumin web interface with the privileges of the
logged-in user. (CVE-2012-2734)

A session fixation flaw was found in Cumin. An authenticated user able to
pre-set the Cumin session cookie in a victim's browser could possibly use
this flaw to steal the victim's session after they log into Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2735)

It was found that authenticated users could send a specially-crafted HTTP
POST request to Cumin that would cause it to submit a job attribute change
to Condor. This could be used to change internal Condor attributes,
including the Owner attribute, which could allow Cumin users to elevate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-3459)

It was discovered that Condor's file system authentication challenge
accepted directories with weak permissions (for example, world readable,
writable and executable permissions). If a user created a directory with
such permissions, a local attacker could rename it, allowing them to
execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user. (CVE-2012-3492)

It was discovered that Condor exposed private information in the data in
the ClassAds format served by condor\_startd. An unauthenticated user able
to connect to condor\_startd's port could request a ClassAd for a running
job, provided they could guess or brute-force the PID of the job. This
could expose the ClaimId which, if obtained, could be used to control the
job as well as start new jobs on the system. (CVE-2012-3493)

It was discovered that the ability to abort a job in Condor only required
WRITE authorization, instead of a combination of WRITE authorization and
job ownership. This could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass
intended restrictions and abort any idle job on the system. (CVE-2012-3491)

The above issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

This update also provides defense in depth patches for Condor. (BZ#848212,
BZ#835592, BZ#841173, BZ#843476)

These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 provide numerous
enhancements and bug fixes for the Grid component of MRG. Some highlights
include:

* Integration with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager via Deltacloud
* Role enforcement in Cumin
* Cumin authentication integration with LDAP
* Enhanced Red Hat HA integration managing multiple-schedulers nodes
* Generic local resource limits for partitionable slots
* Concurrency limit groups

Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, linked to in the
References section, for information on these changes.

## Solution

All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 are advised
to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. Condor
and Cumin must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1278)

## Topic

Updated Grid component packages that fix several security issues, add
various enhancements and fix multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

A number of unprotected resources (web pages, export functionality, image
viewing) were found in Cumin. An unauthenticated user could bypass intended
access restrictions, resulting in information disclosure. (CVE-2012-2680)

Cumin could generate weak session keys, potentially allowing remote
attackers to predict session keys and obtain unauthorized access to Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2681)

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws in Cumin could allow remote attackers
to inject arbitrary web script on a web page displayed by Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2683)

An SQL injection flaw in Cumin could allow remote attackers to manipulate
the contents of the back-end database via a specially-crafted URL.
(CVE-2012-2684)

When Cumin handled image requests, clients could request images of
arbitrary sizes. This could result in large memory allocations on the Cumin
server, leading to an out-of-memory condition. (CVE-2012-2685)

Cumin did not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. If an
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the Cumin web interface,
into visiting a specially-crafted web page, it could lead to unauthorized
command execution in the Cumin web interface with the privileges of the
logged-in user. (CVE-2012-2734)

A session fixation flaw was found in Cumin. An authenticated user able to
pre-set the Cumin session cookie in a victim's browser could possibly use
this flaw to steal the victim's session after they log into Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2735)

It was found that authenticated users could send a specially-crafted HTTP
POST request to Cumin that would cause it to submit a job attribute change
to Condor. This could be used to change internal Condor attributes,
including the Owner attribute, which could allow Cumin users to elevate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-3459)

It was discovered that Condor's file system authentication challenge
accepted directories with weak permissions (for example, world readable,
writable and executable permissions). If a user created a directory with
such permissions, a local attacker could rename it, allowing them to
execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user. (CVE-2012-3492)

It was discovered that Condor exposed private information in the data in
the ClassAds format served by condor\_startd. An unauthenticated user able
to connect to condor\_startd's port could request a ClassAd for a running
job, provided they could guess or brute-force the PID of the job. This
could expose the ClaimId which, if obtained, could be used to control the
job as well as start new jobs on the system. (CVE-2012-3493)

It was discovered that the ability to abort a job in Condor only required
WRITE authorization, instead of a combination of WRITE authorization and
job ownership. This could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass
intended restrictions and abort any idle job on the system. (CVE-2012-3491)

The above issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

This update also provides defense in depth patches for Condor. (BZ#848212,
BZ#835592, BZ#841173, BZ#843476)

These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 provide numerous
enhancements and bug fixes for the Grid component of MRG. Some highlights
include:

* Integration with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager via Deltacloud
* Role enforcement in Cumin
* Cumin authentication integration with LDAP
* Enhanced Red Hat HA integration managing multiple-schedulers nodes
* Generic local resource limits for partitionable slots
* Concurrency limit groups

Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, linked to in the
References section, for information on these changes.

## Solution

All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 are advised
to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. Condor
and Cumin must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Recent developments regarding the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) have some technology leaders on edge. Since February, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has almost completely stopped enriching software vulnerabi...](https://www.flexera.com/blog/vulnerability-management/avoid-missing-crucial-vulnerability-intelligence-amid-nvd-backlog/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=827558#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-01 18:32:17 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer reported a flaw in cumin that would cause it to create weak session keys.  The wooly.util.unique_id() uses the random.getrandbits() function to generate the session keys, however random.getrandbits() leaks state and can eventually become predictable (according to the Python documentation it uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm).  To create truly unique session keys, wooly.util.unique_id() should open /dev/urandom and read 16 bytes from there.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=827558#c1)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-04 16:10:05 UTC  ``` There is a fix for this in revision 5400 on the cumin trunk.  Here is the diff:   def unique_id(): -    bits0 = random.getrandbits(32) -    bits1 = random.getrandbits(32) -    bits2 = random.getrandbits(32) -    bits3 = random.getrandbits(32)   -    return "%08x-%08x-%08x-%08x" % (bits0, bits1, bits2, bits3) +    # Generate 4 unsigned integers. +    # Take 4 bytes from urandom and interpret +    # them as a standard-sized ('=') unsigned long ('L'). +    # Unpack returns a tuple, hence the [0]. +    try: +        bits = [struct.unpack("=L", os.urandom(4))[0] for x in range(4)] +    except NotImplementedError: +        bits = [random.getrandbits(32) for x in range(4)]   +    return "%08x-%08x-%08x-%08x" % (bits[0], bits[1], bits[2], bits[3]) +   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=827558#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2012-08-07 11:25:15 UTC  ``` svn diff -c 5400 <http://svn.fedorahosted.org/svn/cumin> svn diff -c 5437 <http://svn.fedorahosted.org/svn/cumin>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=827558#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 16:10:53 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=827558#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:43:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1278 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1278.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=827558#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:52:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1281 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1281.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=827558#c8)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 21:09:41 UTC  ``` Created cumin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 858868](show_bug.cgi?id=858868 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2680 CVE-2012-2681 CVE-2012-2683 CVE-2012-2684 CVE-2012-2685 CVE-2012-2734 CVE-2012-2735 CVE-2012-3459 cumin various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the

(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=827558#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-01 18:32:17 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer reported a flaw in cumin that would cause it to create weak session keys.  The wooly.util.unique_id() uses the random.getrandbits() function to generate the session keys, however random.getrandbits() leaks state and can eventually become predictable (according to the Python documentation it uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm).  To create truly unique session keys, wooly.util.unique_id() should open /dev/urandom and read 16 bytes from there.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=827558#c1)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-04 16:10:05 UTC  ``` There is a fix for this in revision 5400 on the cumin trunk.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=829421#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-06 16:53:25 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer reported multiple instances of unprotected access (web pages, export functionality, image viewing) in cumin.  An unauthenticated user could view pages that should have been restricted to authenticated users only, resulting in information disclosure.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=829421#c1)  Trevor McKay    2012-06-07 16:48:50 UTC  ``` Fixed in revision 5398 on trunk.  Essentially, a fragment from the existing authentication check on the index.html page has been added to all widgets.  The check can be enabled or disabled, and is disabled by default.  For widgets in the page hierarchy, the check is enabled except where necessary for actual login -- the login page itself, and the css and resource pages which allow it to draw.
