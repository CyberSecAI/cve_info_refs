Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2690:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `virt-edit` tool in `libguestfs`, when editing files inside a guest disk image, would create a new file instead of modifying the original.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Failure to preserve file attributes: Creating a new file instead of editing the existing one resulted in the loss of original file attributes such as permissions, owner, and SELinux context.
- World-readable files: This could lead to sensitive files becoming world-readable if edited by an administrator, potentially exposing them to unauthorized access by unprivileged guest users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Confidentiality breach: Unprivileged guest users could gain access to sensitive files that they should not have access to. This can result in information disclosure.
- Security context bypass: The loss of SELinux context could lead to a bypass of the intended security policy.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `virt-edit` tool within libguestfs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user within the virtual machine guest OS.
-  The attacker needs the existence of a world-readable file, created using `virt-edit` by a privileged user/administrator.
- A privileged user on the host system has to use `virt-edit` to edit a file within the virtual machine.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of such a vulnerable file on the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was addressed in updated `libguestfs` packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
- The severity of the vulnerability was rated as "low" by Red Hat.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `libguestfs-1.16.19-1.el6`
- The fix involves ensuring that `virt-edit` modifies the original file rather than creating a new one, thus preserving its attributes.
