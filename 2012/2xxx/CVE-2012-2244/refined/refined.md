{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows an administrator to set the path to clamav (antivirus software). If an administrator sets this path to a location where a malicious file exists, that file could be executed when the application attempts to use clamav. Additionally, uploaded files were being set as executable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary code execution via configurable clamav path.",
    "Uploaded files are set as executable."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution on the server by uploading and then executing a malicious file.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs administrator access to modify the clamav path and upload a malicious file. Alternatively, they could set the clamav path to `/bin/bash` and then any user could upload and execute a shell script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Administrative access to modify the clamav path setting.",
    "Ability to upload files to the server."
  ]
