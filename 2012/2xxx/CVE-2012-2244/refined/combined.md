## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

[Find out about sharing portfolios](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137011)

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

# Arbitrary Code Execution via pathtoclam config setting

### Bug Description

This bug is related to [bug #1055232](/bugs/1055232)

The ability of the administrator to set the path to clamav can be

abused. For instance changing the path to clamav from '/path/to/av' to

'/path/to/maharadata/artefact/file/originals/9/9' can cause a

malicious uploaded file to be executed. This requires that the saved file

is set to executable on upload, which currently it is.

They could also potentially set it to /bin/bash, allowing any user to upload

a shell script that doesn't require the executable bit set to run.

Fixes:

- Because installing antivirus will require shell access to the

server it seems reasonable to require setting the path to the AV be

done in a configuration file rather than a settings page. It could be

argued that in web applications generally, admin web access should not

be equivalent to shell access, due to relatively ease of session

compromise (as compared to shell access).

- Uploaded files should not be set to executable.

Sorry, these bugs have the wrong bug number in the commit message, as they came from [bug #1055232](/bugs/1055232) originally. I will change them in my git branch for when we release.

Also, the -2 meaning 1st fix and -3 meaning 2nd fix may be confusing to some.

If there is no patch for the version you wish to patch, then pick the next highest version and so on until you hit the master patches. ie [bug-1055232](/bugs/1055232)-3-14.patch is for 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 for fix 2

### Bug Description

This bug is related to [bug #1055232](/bugs/1055232)

The ability of the administrator to set the path to clamav can be

abused. For instance changing the path to clamav from '/path/to/av' to

'/path/to/maharadata/artefact/file/originals/9/9' can cause a

malicious uploaded file to be executed. This requires that the saved file

is set to executable on upload, which currently it is.

They could also potentially set it to /bin/bash, allowing any user to upload

a shell script that doesn't require the executable bit set to run.

Fixes:

- Because installing antivirus will require shell access to the

server it seems reasonable to require setting the path to the AV be

done in a configuration file rather than a settings page. It could be

argued that in web applications generally, admin web access should not

be equivalent to shell access, due to relatively ease of session

compromise (as compared to shell access).

- Uploaded files should not be set to executable.

Sorry, these bugs have the wrong bug number in the commit message, as they came from [bug #1055232](/bugs/1055232) originally. I will change them in my git branch for when we release.

Also, the -2 meaning 1st fix and -3 meaning 2nd fix may be confusing to some.

If there is no patch for the version you wish to patch, then pick the next highest version and so on until you hit the master patches. ie [bug-1055232](/bugs/1055232)-3-14.patch is for 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 for fix 2
