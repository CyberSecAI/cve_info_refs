{
  "CVE-2012-2377": {
    "description": "When a JGroups channel is started, the JGroups diagnostics service will be enabled by default with no authentication. This service is exposed via IP multicast. On JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6, an attacker on an adjacent network can exploit this flaw to read diagnostics information and invoke JMX operations on the server (limited remote code execution). On other affected JBoss products, an attacker on an adjacent network can exploit this flaw only to read diagnostics information (information disclosure).",
    "root_cause": "The JGroups diagnostics service is enabled by default without any authentication when a JGroups channel is started.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unauthenticated access to JGroups diagnostics service.",
      "Information disclosure of diagnostics data.",
      "Potential for limited remote code execution through JMX operations (in specific products like JBoss EAP 6)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on an adjacent network can read diagnostic information. In some JBoss products, they can also invoke JMX operations leading to limited remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "IP multicast"
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker on an adjacent network."
