# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**How does MS12-064 relate to this bulletin (MS12-066)?**

The security update packages for Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010 Service Pack 1 (KB2687401) in this bulletin, MS12-066, also address the vulnerabilities described in [MS12-064](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260965).

**A Microsoft Office component discussed in this bulletin is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

For example, Microsoft InfoPath 2010 is included in Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010. Systems with Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 will be offered updates for InfoPath 2010 whether InfoPath 2010 is installed or not. This would not be the case for Microsoft Office Standard 2010, because InfoPath 2010 is not included in Office Standard 2010.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**Why are multiple update packages available for some affected software?**

The updates required to address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are offered across different updates packages as indicated in the **Affected Software** table due to the componentized servicing model for Microsoft Office and Microsoft SharePoint Server software.

**There are multiple update packages available for some affected software. Do I need to install all of the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, depending on their configuration of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, not all the server-package updates listed in this bulletin may apply. For more information on the applicability of these server-package updates in a SharePoint environment, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2741517](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2741517).

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for one version of Microsoft Office or Microsoft SharePoint Server software can be applied in any sequence.

**What is Microsoft Groove Server 2010?**

Microsoft Groove Server 2010 provides comprehensive services for managing Microsoft SharePoint Workspace. Groove Server 2010 contains two components: Groove Server 2010 Manager and Groove Server 2010 Relay, each of which runs on a Windows server on an enterprise network.

**How is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 related to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007?**

Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 is an integrated suite of server capabilities built on top of Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.

For systems with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 installed, you will need to apply the KB2687356 update for Windows SharePoint Services 3.0. There is no configuration where you can only have Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and not Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.

**What is Microsoft SharePoint Services 3.0?**

[Windows SharePoint Services 3.0](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/sharepoint/bb684453) provides a platform for collaborative applications, offering a common framework for document management and a common repository for storing documents of all types. It exposes key Windows Server services like Windows Workflow Services and Windows Rights Management Services.

Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 is provided as a free download for supported editions of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.

**What is Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010?**

[Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010](https://technet.microsoft.com/sharepoint/ee263910.aspx) is the new version of Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services. It is the essential solution for organizations that need a secure, manageable, web-based collaboration platform. SharePoint helps teams stay connected and productive by providing easy access to the people, documents, and information that they need to make well-informed decisions and get work done. Use SharePoint Foundation to coordinate schedules, organize documents, and participate in discussions through team workspaces, blogs, wikis, and document libraries on the platform that is the underlying infrastructure for SharePoint Server.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why is the Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) update only available from the Microsoft Download Center?**

Microsoft is releasing the update for Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) to the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129) only. Because the user level installation of Lync 2010 Attendee is handled through a Lync session, distribution methods such as automatic updating are not appropriate for this type of installation scenario.

**Where are the hashes of the security updates?**

The SHA1 and SHA2 hashes of the security updates can be used to verify the authenticity of downloaded security update packages. For the hash information pertaining to this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2741517](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2741517).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

#### FAQ for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2520

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that HTML strings are sanitized.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read content that the attacker is not authorized to read or use the victim's identity to take actions on the targeted site or application.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to convince a user to click a link that goes to a specially crafted URL, or send the user a specially crafted chat message.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted URL that directs the user to the targeted SharePoint site that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's website.

In a chat-based attack scenario, an attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted script to a Lync or Microsoft Communicator chat window. Because of the vulnerability, in specific situations the specially crafted script is not properly sanitized, which subsequently could lead to an attacker-supplied script being run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content.

For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user receives a specially crafted chat message for any malicious action to occur.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Lync or Microsoft Communicator are used frequently and environments where users connect to a SharePoint server are primarily at risk for this vulnerability.

**What is HTML sanitization?**

HTML sanitization is a process that restricts HTML to elements that can be safely displayed in a browser.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that HTML strings are sanitized.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2012-2520](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-2520).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the **Add or Remove Programs** item in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the **Add or Remove Programs** item in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify that the security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.
