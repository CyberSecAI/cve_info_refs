Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-2520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of HTML strings within the affected Microsoft products. Specifically, the way these products handle and process HTML content before displaying it is flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper HTML Sanitization:** The core weakness lies in the inadequate filtering or sanitization of HTML input. This allows for the possibility of injecting malicious HTML or script code.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The vulnerability enables cross-site scripting attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges within the context of the logged-on user.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Remote code execution could be achieved by an attacker.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject client-side scripts that execute in the security context of a user.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker might use the victim's identity to perform actions on a targeted site or application.
- **Denial of Service:** In some cases, triggering the vulnerability might result in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted URLs:** Attackers can trick users into clicking on a malicious link that directs them to a specially crafted URL.
- **Malicious Chat Messages:** Attackers can send specially crafted chat messages to users through Microsoft Lync or Communicator. These messages contain malicious scripts that get executed when viewed.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can host malicious content on compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to employ social engineering tactics to convince users to interact with malicious links or messages.
- **Ability to send messages:** For the chat-based attack vector, the attacker must be able to send messages through the affected chat applications.
- **Hosting Infrastructure:** For web-based attacks, attackers need to have a web server to host the malicious content.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability affects various Microsoft products, including Microsoft Office (InfoPath), Microsoft Communications Platforms (Communicator, Lync), Microsoft Server software (SharePoint), and Microsoft Office Web Apps.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Important".
- Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been publicly disclosed (CVE-2012-2520).
- The fix involves modifying how the affected products sanitize HTML strings to prevent malicious injection.
