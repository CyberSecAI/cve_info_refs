        "source": "www.exploit-db.com_49b23c07_20250125_072828.html",
        "vulnerability": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting",
        "description": "The WordPress Postie plugin version 1.4.3 is vulnerable to persistent XSS. By sending a specially crafted email, an attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code. The injected payload will be stored within the system and executed when the affected page is loaded.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of the 'From' field in emails processed by the Postie plugin. When Postie parses the email, it does not properly sanitize the 'From' field before storing and displaying it, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Improper Input Sanitization",
            "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
         ],
        "impact": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
        "attack_vectors": "Email injection.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send an email to the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin. The attacker must be able to craft a malicious 'From' field with an XSS payload."
