Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the EmailArchitect Enterprise Email Server version 10.0. It stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The server fails to properly sanitize user-controlled data before displaying it, specifically in the "From" and "Date" fields within email headers. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored by the server and executed when a user views the affected email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the affected email.
- **Potential for Account Compromise:** This could lead to stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, potentially allowing for account compromise and further attacks, such as redirecting users to malicious websites, displaying unwanted content, or performing actions on their behalf.
- **Reputation Damage:**  The email server's reputation could be damaged if it's seen as a vector for malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Injection:** An attacker crafts a specially crafted email with malicious JavaScript payload in the "From" and "Date" fields of the email headers.
- **SMTP Communication:** The crafted email is sent to the vulnerable EmailArchitect server via SMTP.
- **Stored XSS:** When a user views the email using the EmailArchitect email client or webmail interface, the malicious JavaScript is executed within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send emails to the vulnerable server:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to an email server running EmailArchitect Enterprise Email Server v10.0. This means the attacker can be internal or external.
- **Knowledge of email injection techniques:** The attacker needs to craft a special email with JavaScript code in the "From" and "Date" headers.
- **No user interaction is needed beyond the normal viewing of email:** The XSS is stored so when a user views the email, the payload is executed.

**Additional details:**
The exploit-db entry provides specific example payloads for injection in "From" and "Date" headers, and a python script for sending email with malicious payload.

The exploit-db entry also specifies vulnerable OS: Windows Server 2003 SP2, and test environment OS: Window 7 Pro SP1 (x86), OS: MAC OS Lion; Browser: Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 12.
