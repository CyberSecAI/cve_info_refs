The content is related to CVE-2012-2562.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The MobileTrack application does not verify the source of SMS commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Lack of authentication for administrative SMS commands (CWE-306)

**Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send SMS commands to the MobileTrack application as if they were the administrator. This can lead to:
    *   Uninstalling the application (using the TERM command).
    *   Wiping the entire phone (using the WIPE command).

**Attack vectors:**
*   Sending SMS commands to a device with MobileTrack installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to know the phone number of the device with MobileTrack installed.
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate or have any prior access to the device or the application.
