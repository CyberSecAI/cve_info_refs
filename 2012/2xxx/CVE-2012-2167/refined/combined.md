# IBM XIV Storage System Gen3 (MTM 2810-114, 2812-114) - access to open TCP ports might lead to loss of access to data

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

On IBM XIV Storage System Gen3 (MTM 2810-114, 2812-114) that is running code level 11.0.1.a or lower, there are open TCP ports which if accessed might lead to system outage.

## Content

**VULNERABILITY DETAILS**

**CVE ID: CVE-2012-2167**

In systems with the affected code levels there are a set of TCP ports that were used for software error injection during test cycles. Those ports are not needed for normal operation, and therefore have now been closed. Under certain circumstances, data injected into the previously open ports could cause loss of access to data. Accordingly, installation of this update is recommended.

**CVSS:**
