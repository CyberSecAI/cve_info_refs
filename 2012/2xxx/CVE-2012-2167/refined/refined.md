- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unnecessary TCP ports, used for software error injection during testing, were left open in production systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open TCP ports that should not have been exposed in production environments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Data injected into these open ports could cause loss of access to data and potentially system outage.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to the open TCP ports.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable system and the ability to inject data into the open ports.
