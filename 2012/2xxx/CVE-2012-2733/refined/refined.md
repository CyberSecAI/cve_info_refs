CVE-2012-2733:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The checks limiting the size of request headers were performed too late in the parsing process for the HTTP NIO connector.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Lack of proper input validation for HTTP headers, specifically size limitations.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker could trigger an OutOfMemoryError, leading to a denial of service, by sending a single request with very large headers.
  - Attack vectors: Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with excessively large headers to the server using the NIO connector.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and has no specific position requirements.
