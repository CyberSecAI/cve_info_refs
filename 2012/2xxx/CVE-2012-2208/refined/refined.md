Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-2208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory path traversal issue in the `upgrade.php` file of Piwigo. The `language` GET parameter is not properly sanitized and is used in an `include()` function to load language files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Path Traversal:** The application allows an attacker to manipulate the `language` parameter to include files outside the intended directory. This is a classic directory traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By using directory traversal, an attacker can include a malicious PHP file located anywhere in the filesystem accessible by the webserver (e.g. in /tmp) with a name that matches one of the language files. The attacker controlled PHP code will then be executed on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The `language` parameter in the `upgrade.php` script is the primary attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting Piwigo.
- The attacker needs to place a malicious PHP file with a name matching one of the language files at a known location on the server.
- No authentication is needed

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in `upgrade.php`, and the `language` parameter is used unsanitized in an `include()` function which loads `common.lang.php`, `admin.lang.php`, `install.lang.php`, or `upgrade.lang.php` depending on the requested context.
- The exploit example provided is: `http://[host]/upgrade.php?language=../../../../../tmp/`
- The attacker has to create a malicious file named e.g. `admin.lang.php` in `/tmp/` that will then be included by the vulnerable code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in Piwigo version 2.3.3 and likely prior versions.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Piwigo version 2.3.4.
- This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2012-2209, which relates to XSS vulnerabilities.
