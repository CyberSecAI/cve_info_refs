Now, you can see if a host's logical network definitions are out of sync with its data center logical network definitions, and synchronize them if desired using the "Setup Networks" action. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2012-12-04 19:16:19 UTC | | | oVirt Team: | Network | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.1

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1506)

## Topic

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.1 is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally
managing collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give
administrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts were added to
the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. The Python scripts
needed to configure the host for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were
stored in the "/tmp/" directory and could be pre-created by an attacker. A
local, unprivileged user on the host to be added to the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization environment could use this flaw to escalate their
privileges. This update provides the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Manager part of the fix. The RHSA-2012:1508 VDSM update (Red Hat Enterprise
Linux hosts) must also be installed to completely fix this issue.
(CVE-2012-0860)

A flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor hosts were added to the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization environment. The Python scripts needed to configure the host
for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were downloaded in an insecure way,
that is, without properly validating SSL certificates during HTTPS
connections. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to
conduct a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially gaining root access to the
host being added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. This
update provides the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager part of the
fix. The RHSA-2012:1508 VDSM update (Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts) or
RHSA-2012:1505 rhev-hypervisor6 update (Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor hosts) must also be installed to completely fix this issue.
(CVE-2012-0861)

It was found that under certain conditions, Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager would fail to lock the screen on a virtual machine
between SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments)
sessions. A user with access to a virtual machine in Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Manager could potentially exploit this flaw to gain access
to another user's unlocked desktop session. (CVE-2011-4316)

It was found that Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager did not
correctly pass wipe-after-delete when moving disks between storage domains.
This resulted in such disks not being securely deleted as expected,
potentially leading to information disclosure. (CVE-2012-5516)

A flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
back end checked the privileges of users making requests via the SOAP and
GWT APIs. An authenticated attacker able to issue queries against Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager could use this flaw to query data that
they should not have access to. (CVE-2012-2696)

These issues were discovered by Red Hat.

In addition to resolving the above security issues these updated Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager packages fix various bugs, and add
various enhancements.

Documentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available in the
Technical Notes:

<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Technical_Notes/index.html>

All Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages which resolve these security issues, fix these
bugs, and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
