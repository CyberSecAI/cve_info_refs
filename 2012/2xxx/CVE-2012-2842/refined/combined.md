## Safari 6.0.1

**Note**: For OS X Mountain Lion systems, Safari 6.0.1 is included with OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2.

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted downloaded HTML document may lead to the disclosure of local file content

  Description: In OS X Mountain Lion HTML files were removed from the unsafe type list. Quarantined HTML documents are opened in a safe mode that prevents accessing other local or remote resources. A logic error in Safari's handling of the Quarantine attribute caused the safe mode not to be triggered on Quarantined files. This issue was addressed by properly detecting the existence of the Quarantine attribute.
