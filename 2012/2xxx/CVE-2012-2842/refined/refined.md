Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** error in the handling of counters within WebKit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core issue is that memory allocated for a counter is freed, but the software continues to access or use the freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution:** Exploiting the use-after-free vulnerability can lead to the application crashing (unexpected termination). In more severe cases, it could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system, potentially taking control of the affected application or even the entire device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Visiting a maliciously crafted website:**  The vulnerability is triggered by accessing a specially designed web page that exploits the counter handling flaw.
*   **Downloaded HTML document:** For Safari, opening a malicious HTML document can also trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious website or embed the malicious HTML into a downloadable file.
*  The user has to visit the malicious page or open the malicious file on a vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in WebKit, affecting multiple Apple products like Safari and iTunes.
*   The vulnerability was also present in Chromium.
*   The vulnerability was identified and credited to "miaubiz"
*   The fix involves improved memory handling, specifically addressing the use-after-free condition in counter handling.
