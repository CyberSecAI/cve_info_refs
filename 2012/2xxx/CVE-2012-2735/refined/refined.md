  "CVE-2012-2735": {
    "Description": "A session fixation flaw was found in Cumin. An authenticated user able to pre-set the Cumin session cookie in a victim's browser could possibly use this flaw to steal the victim's session after they log into Cumin.",
    "Root cause": "Cumin does not reset the session cookie after authentication.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Session fixation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could steal a victim's session and gain unauthorized access to Cumin.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker obtains a session cookie from the server.",
      "The attacker uses loopholes in the browser security model to set the cookie in the victim's browser.",
      "The victim logs into the site.",
      "The attacker uses the victim's session."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker must be able to obtain a session cookie from the server.",
      "The attacker must be able to set a cookie in the victim's browser (through browser security loopholes)."
    ],
        "More Details": "The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to potentially hijack a user's session by first obtaining a valid session ID. Then, by leveraging loopholes within the victim's browser they can inject the pre-determined cookie, effectively gaining control of the session after the user has logged in to the application."
