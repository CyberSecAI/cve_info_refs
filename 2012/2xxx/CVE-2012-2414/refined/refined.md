```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A flaw in the Asterisk Manager Interface allows users to bypass security checks and execute shell commands even when they lack the necessary "System class authorization".
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper authorization checks within the Asterisk Manager Interface. Specifically, the MixMonitor application with the originate action, or the GetVar or Status manager actions combined with the SHELL and EVAL functions could be exploited to execute shell commands without proper authorization.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker could gain unauthorized shell access and execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through authenticated sessions with the Asterisk Manager Interface.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the Asterisk Manager Interface and be able to issue commands through the interface.
