**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Drupal "Zen" module

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided text doesn't detail the specific coding error, but it indicates the "Zen" Drupal module is vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to:
    * Cookie theft.
    * Session hijacking.
    * Defacement of the website.
    * Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    * Other malicious activities performed within the context of the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**  Attackers can inject malicious scripts through user-controlled input fields or other vulnerable parts of the "Zen" module. When a user views the page containing the injected script, their browser executes the script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script code into the vulnerable parts of the Drupal module. This may require them to be a registered user or exploit some other vulnerability to gain access to the injection points.
