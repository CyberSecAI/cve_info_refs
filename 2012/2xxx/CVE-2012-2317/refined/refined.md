Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A Debian/Ubuntu specific patch (`php_crypt_revamped.patch`) applied to the PHP `crypt()` function caused it to incorrectly handle empty or NULL salt strings. Instead of generating a random salt and a corresponding hash, it returned an empty string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Fail-Open Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is that when `crypt()` is called with an empty or NULL salt, it produces an empty string instead of a proper hash. This means that if a PHP application uses `crypt()` to generate password hashes and does not provide a salt, authentication will succeed for any password against those accounts as the check would be comparing the submitted password hash to an empty string.
*   **Inconsistent Behavior:** The patch also caused inconsistencies in the length of the generated salts for CRYPT_EXT_DES hashes, leading to authentication failures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The most critical impact is the potential for complete bypass of authentication. Attackers could log in to any account if the password hashes were created with the vulnerable `crypt()` function using a NULL or empty salt, because the stored password hash could be an empty string.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through any PHP application that uses the `crypt()` function to hash passwords without providing a salt. This vulnerability is specific to systems where the problematic Debian/Ubuntu patch has been applied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to target a vulnerable PHP application deployed on an affected Ubuntu (10.04 and 11.04) system that uses PHP's crypt() without providing a salt.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special position; they simply need to interact with the login functionality of the affected PHP application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was introduced by the `php_crypt_revamped.patch`, which aimed to use system-provided crypto instead of PHP's bundled code.
*   The vulnerability was present in Debian versions 5.3.2-1 and fixed in versions 5.3.6-1 and 5.3.3-7+squeeze4. However, the fix was not initially included in Ubuntu 11.04.
*   The problem was reported by Boaz Rymland.
*   This issue affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and 11.04.
