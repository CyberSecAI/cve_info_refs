{
  "CVE-2012-2661": {
    "description": "A security flaw was found in the way rubygem-activerecord, the ActiveRecord pattern for ORM, performed SQL query generation based on the content of params hash, when nested query paramaters were provided. If a Ruby on Rails application directly passed request params to the 'where' method of an ActiveRecord class, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the 'params[:id]' to return a specially-crafted hash, resulting into the WHERE clause of the SQL statement to query an arbitrary table with value of attacker's choice, leading to disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of nested parameters in SQL query generation within the rubygem-activerecord component.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Sensitive information disclosure through the ability to query an arbitrary table with attacker-controlled values in the WHERE clause of the SQL statement.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially-crafted HTTP request with manipulated nested query parameters."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Ruby on Rails application that uses Active Record and directly passes request parameters to the `where` method of an ActiveRecord class, and they must be able to craft the nested parameters in a specific format.",
