Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2193:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within IBM Cognos BI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the rendered web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker's JavaScript code to execute within the victim's web browser. This can have several consequences:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** If the session cookie is accessible to the injected script, the attacker can steal the victim's session and gain unauthorized access to their account.
    *   **Data Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal sensitive information displayed on the web page.
    *   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can use the injected script to perform malicious actions on behalf of the victim, such as changing settings or initiating unwanted transactions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when clicked by the victim, injects the malicious script into the web page.
*   **Additional User Interaction:** The user is required to click a link and then click an additional link on the rendered web page to trigger the malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker must be capable of constructing a URL that includes the malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must persuade the victim to click the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects all supported platforms of IBM Cognos BI.
*   The document suggests a mitigation is to configure IBM Cognos BI to use the "httpOnly" attribute for the session cookie, preventing the attacker from stealing the session id through the injected script.
*   Interim fixes are available to address this vulnerability.
