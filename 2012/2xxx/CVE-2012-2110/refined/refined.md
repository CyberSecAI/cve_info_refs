  "CVE-2012-2110": {
    "description": "Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "Multiple numeric conversion errors in OpenSSL's ASN.1 parsing, specifically when reading DER encoded data from BIO inputs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer conversion errors",
        "Buffer overflow",
        "Lack of proper bounds checking"
      ],
      "impact": "An application using the OpenSSL library could be made to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially-crafted DER encoded data",
	"BIO inputs"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide specially crafted DER encoded data which would trigger the vulnerable code path. This could occur via various BIO inputs (file, network stream, etc.) to an application using OpenSSL."
