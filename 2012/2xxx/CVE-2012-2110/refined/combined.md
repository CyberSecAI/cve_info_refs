## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0518)

## Topic

Updated openssl, openssl097a, and openssl098e packages that fix one
security issue are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were
found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data
from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER
(Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO
input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2110)

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
a backported patch to resolve this issue. For the update to take effect,
all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system
rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2012:1307 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2012-09-24
Updated:
2012-09-24
# RHSA-2012:1307 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for the OpenSSL component for JBoss Enterprise Application
Platform 5.1.2 for Solaris and Microsoft Windows that fixes multiple
security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were
found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data
from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER
(Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO
input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2110)

A double free flaw was discovered in the policy checking code in OpenSSL.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application that uses
OpenSSL by providing an X.509 certificate that has specially-crafted
policy extension data. (CVE-2011-4109)

An information leak flaw was found in the SSL 3.0 protocol implementation
in OpenSSL. Incorrect initialization of SSL record padding bytes could
cause an SSL client or server to send a limited amount of possibly
sensitive data to its SSL peer via the encrypted connection.
(CVE-2011-4576)

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of TLS/SSL
handshake restarts required to support Server Gated Cryptography. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL consume
an excessive amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake.
(CVE-2011-4619)

This update also fixes additional security issues in OpenSSL that are not
exposed in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform: CVE-2011-4108,
CVE-2012-0884, CVE-2012-1165, and CVE-2012-2333.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss Enterprise
Application Platform's "server/[PROFILE]/deploy/" directory, along with all
other customized configuration files.

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 for Solaris and
Microsoft Windows as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised
to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

JBoss server instances configured to use the Tomcat Native library must be
restarted for this update to take effect.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Incorrect integer conversions in OpenSSL can result in memory corruption.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

CVE-2012-2110

This advisory is intended for system administrators and developers exposing
OpenSSL in production systems to untrusted data.

asn1_d2i_read_bio in OpenSSL contains multiple integer errors that can cause
memory corruption when parsing encoded ASN.1 data. This error can be exploited
on systems that parse untrusted data, such as X.509 certificates or RSA public
keys.

The following context structure from asn1.h is used to record the current state
of the decoder:

typedef struct asn1_const_ctx_st
{
    const unsigned char *p;/* work char pointer */
    int eos;    /* end of sequence read for indefinite encoding */
    int error;  /* error code to use when returning an error */
    int inf;    /* constructed if 0x20, indefinite is 0x21 */
    int tag;    /* tag from last 'get object' */
    int xclass; /* class from last 'get object' */
    long slen;  /* length of last 'get object' */
    const unsigned char *max; /* largest value of p allowed */
    const unsigned char *q;/* temporary variable */
    const unsigned char **pp;/* variable */
    int line;   /* used in error processing */
} ASN1_const_CTX;

These members are populated via calls to ASN1_get_object and asn1_get_length
which have the following prototypes

int ASN1_get_object(const unsigned char **pp,
                    long *plength,
                    int *ptag,
                    int *pclass,
                    long omax);

int asn1_get_length(const unsigned char **pp,
                    int *inf,
                    long *rl,
                    int max);

The lengths are always stored as signed longs, however, asn1_d2i_read_bio
casts ASN1_const_CTX->slen to a signed int in multiple locations. This
truncation can result in numerous conversion problems.

The most visible example on x64 is this cast incorrectly interpreting the
result of asn1_get_length.

222             /* suck in c.slen bytes of data */
223             want=(int)c.slen;

A simple way to demonstrate this is to prepare a DER certificate that contains
a length with the 31st bit set, like so

$ dumpasn1 testcase.crt
0 NDEF: [PRIVATE 3] {
   2 2147483648:   [1]
        ...
   }

Breakpoint 2, asn1_d2i_read_bio (in=0x9173a0, pb=0x7fffffffd8f0) at a_d2i_fp.c:224
224             if (want > (len-off))
(gdb) list
219             }
220         else
221             {
222             /* suck in c.slen bytes of data */
223             want=(int)c.slen;
224             if (want > (len-off))
225                 {
226                 want-=(len-off);
227                 if (!BUF_MEM_grow_clean(b,len+want))
228                     {
(gdb) p c.slen
$18 = 2147483648
(gdb) p want
$19 = -2147483648

This results in an inconsistent state, and will lead to memory corruption.

--------------------
Affected Software
------------------------

All versions of OpenSSL on all platforms up to and including version 1.0.1 are
affected.

Some attack vectors require an I32LP64 architecture, others do not.

--------------------
Consequences
-----------------------

In order to explore the subtle problems caused by this, an unrelated bug in the
OpenSSL allocator wrappers must be discussed.

It is generally expected that the realloc standard library routine should support
reducing the size of a buffer, as well as increasing it. As ISO C99 states "The
realloc function deallocates the old object pointed to by ptr and returns a
pointer to a new object that has the size speciﬁed by size. The contents of the
new object shall be the same as that of the old object prior to deallocation,
up to the lesser of the new and old sizes."

However, the wrapper routines from OpenSSL do not support shrinking a buffer,
due to this code:

void *CRYPTO_realloc_clean(void *str, int old_len, int num, const char *file, int line)
{
    /* ... */
    ret=malloc_ex_func(num,file,line);
    if(ret)
        {
        memcpy(ret,str,old_len);
        OPENSSL_cleanse(str,old_len);
        free_func(str);
        }
    /* ... */
    return ret;
}

The old data is always copied over, regardless of whether the new size will be
enough. This allows us to turn this truncation into what is effectively:

    memcpy(heap_buffer, <attacker controlled buffer>, <attacker controlled size>);

We can reach this code by simply causing an integer to be sign extended and
truncated multiple times. These two protoypes are relevant:

int BUF_MEM_grow_clean(BUF_MEM *str, size_t len);

void *CRYPTO_realloc_clean(void *str, int old_len, int num, const char *file, int line);

BUF_MEM_grow_clean accepts a size_t, but the subroutine it uses to handle the
allocation only accepts a 32bit signed integer. We can exploit this by
providing a large amount of data to OpenSSL, and causing the length calculation
here to become negative:

            /* suck in c.slen bytes of data */
            want=(int)c.slen;
            if (want > (len-off))
                {
                want-=(len-off);
                if (!BUF_MEM_grow_clean(b,len+want))
                    {
                    ASN1err(ASN1_F_ASN1_D2I_READ_BIO,ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE);
                    goto err;
                    }

Because want is a signed int, the sign extension to size_t for
BUF_MEM_grow_clean means an unexpectedly size_t is produced. An
example is probably helpful:

(gdb) bt
#0  asn1_d2i_read_bio (in=0x9173a0, pb=0x7fffffffd8f0) at a_d2i_fp.c:223
#1  0x0000000000524ce8 in ASN1_item_d2i_bio (it=0x62d740, in=0x9173a0, x=0x0) at a_d2i_fp.c:112

#5  0x00000000004032d9 in do_cmd (prog=0x9123e0, argc=3, argv=0x7fffffffe440) at openssl.c:489
#6  0x0000000000402ee6 in main (Argc=3, Argv=0x7fffffffe440) at openssl.c:381
(gdb) list
218                 want=HEADER_SIZE;
219             }
220         else
221             {
222             /* suck in c.slen bytes of data */
223             want=(int)c.slen;
224             if (want > (len-off))
225                 {
226                 want-=(len-off);
227                 if (!BUF_MEM_grow_clean(b,len+want))
(gdb) pt len
type = int
(gdb) pt want
type = int
(gdb) p len
$28 = 1431655797
(gdb) p want
$29 = 2147483646
(gdb) p len+want
$30 = -715827853
(gdb) s
BUF_MEM_grow_clean (str=0x917440, len=18446744072993723763) at buffer.c:133
(gdb) p/x len
$31 = 0xffffffffd5555573

Here len+want wraps to a negative value, which is sign extended to a large
size_t for BUF_MEM_grow_clean. Now the call to CRYPTO_realloc_clean() truncates
this back into a signed int:

CRYPTO_realloc_clean (str=0x7fff85be4010, old_len=1908874388, num=477218632, file=0x626661 "buffer.c", line=149) at mem.c:369

Now old_len > num, which openssl does not handle, resulting in this:

 ret = malloc_ex_func(num, file, line);

 memcpy(ret, str, old_len);

Effectively a textbook heap overflow. It is likely this code is reachable via
the majority of the d2i BIO interfaces and their wrappers, so most applications
that handle untrusted data via OpenSSL should take action.

Note that even if you do not use d2i_* calls directly, many of the higher level
APIs will use it indirectly for you. Producing DER data to demonstrate this
is relatively easy for both x86 and x64 architectures.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0884 CVE-2012-1165 CVE-2012-2110

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2012-0884

	Ivan Nestlerode discovered a weakness in the CMS and PKCS #7
	implementations that could allow an attacker to decrypt data
	via a Million Message Attack (MMA).

CVE-2012-1165

	It was discovered that a NULL pointer could be dereferenced
	when parsing certain S/MIME messages, leading to denial of
	service.

CVE-2012-2110

	Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team, discovered a vulnerability
	in the way DER-encoded ASN.1 data is parsed that can result in
	a heap overflow.

Additionally, the fix for CVE-2011-4619 has been updated to address an
issue with SGC handshakes.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze11.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1a-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

Here's the fix, by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL core team:  "Make sure tkeylen is initialised properly when encrypting CMS messages." <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22537>  or with an additional compiler warning fix:  <http://cvs.openssl.org/filediff?f=openssl/crypto/cms/cms_enc.c&v1=1.11&v2=1.13>  (Note: the "tkeylen = 0" portion is just to silence a possible compiler warning; the actual fix is to the code.)  The bug had been introduced in:  "Fix for CMS/PKCS7 MMA. If RSA decryption fails use a random key and continue with symmetric decryption process to avoid leaking timing information to an attacker." <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22251>  and more specifically in this portion:  <http://cvs.openssl.org/filediff?f=openssl/crypto/cms/cms_enc.c&v1=1.10&v2=1.11>  which introduced the tkey and tkeylen variables.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=802725#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-24 16:02:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.0  Via RHSA-2012:1308 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1308.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=802725#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-24 16:03:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2  Via RHSA-2012:1307 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1307.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=802725#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-24 16:04:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:1306 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1306.html>   ``` |  |

# USN-1424-1: OpenSSL vulnerabilities

19 April 2012

An application using OpenSSL could be made to crash or run programs if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

It was discovered that OpenSSL could be made to dereference a NULL pointer

when processing S/MIME messages. A remote attacker could use this to cause

a denial of service. These issues did not affect Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

([CVE-2006-7250](/security/CVE-2006-7250), [CVE-2012-1165](/security/CVE-2012-1165))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that OpenSSL did not properly perform bounds

checking when processing DER data via BIO or FILE functions. A remote

attacker could trigger this flaw in services that used SSL to cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with application

privileges. ([CVE-2012-2110](/security/CVE-2012-2110))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.17)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [1.0.0e-2ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/1.0.0e-2ubuntu4.4)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [0.9.8o-5ubuntu1.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/0.9.8o-5ubuntu1.4)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.10)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0522)

## Topic

Updated openssl packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 Extended Life Cycle Support; Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5.3 Long Life; and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6, 6.0 and
6.1 Extended Update Support.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were
found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data
from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER
(Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO
input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2110)

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
a backported patch to resolve this issue. For the update to take effect,
all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system
rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=820686#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-05-10 17:18:09 UTC  ``` It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle TLS record length values from the received TLS packets.  After subtracting the number of padding bytes from the record length value, it did not check the resulting record length before subtracting the size of explicit IV (initialization vector for CBC encryption modes).  This could result in an integer underflow of the record length value, leading to a buffer over-read and out-of-bounds access.  A remote TLS peer could use this to crash an application using OpenSSL (usually a TLS or DTLS server) by sending a specially TLS packet.  Explicit IV is used in TLS 1.2, 1.1 and DTLS.  The openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, and 6 only support TLS 1.0 and do not support TLS 1.1 and 1.2 and hence are not affected by the TLS part of this problem.  TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2 support was introduced upstream in OpenSSL version 1.0.1.  That version is currently only available in Fedora Rawhide/18.  The support for DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) is enabled in openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 and those versions are affected by the DTLS part of this problem.  Applications using openssl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 to provide TLS/SSL service (such as httpd) are not affected by this issue.  Upstream fix: <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22538> (0.9.8) <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22547> (1.0.1)  This was fixed upstream in versions: 0.9.8x, 1.0.0j and 1.0.1c  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Codenomicon as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=820686#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-05-10 17:33:23 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <http://openssl.org/news/secadv_20120510.txt>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=820686#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2012-05-10 17:35:09 UTC  ``` Created mingw32-openssl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 820694](show_bug.cgi?id=820694 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-2333 openssl: record length handling integer underflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=820686#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-05-10 17:35:13 UTC  ``` Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 820693](show_bug.cgi?id=820693 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2333 openssl: record length handling integer underflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=820686#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-05-15 06:44:45 UTC  ``` CERT-FI advisory: <http://www.cert.fi/en/reports/2012/vulnerability641549.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=820686#c7)  James Hammett    2012-05-18 07:11:35 UTC  ``` The statement:  Explicit IV is used in TLS 1.2, 1.1 and DTLS.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0990 : Ward van Wanrooij

* **Note**: Starting with OS X v10.8.4, Java Web Start (i.e., JNLP) applications downloaded from the Internet need to be signed with a Developer ID certificate. Gatekeeper will check downloaded Java Web Start applications for a signature and block such applications from launching if they are not properly signed.

  You can use the codesign utility to sign the JNLP file, which will attach the code signature to the JNLP file as extended attributes. To preserve these attributes, package the JNLP file in a ZIP, XIP, or DMG file. Be careful using the ZIP format, as some third-party tools might not capture the required extended attributes correctly.

# RHSA-2012:1306 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for the OpenSSL component for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2
for Solaris and Microsoft Windows that fixes multiple security issues is
now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were
found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data
from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER
(Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO
input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2110)

A double free flaw was discovered in the policy checking code in OpenSSL.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application that uses
OpenSSL by providing an X.509 certificate that has specially-crafted
policy extension data. (CVE-2011-4109)

An information leak flaw was found in the SSL 3.0 protocol implementation
in OpenSSL. Incorrect initialization of SSL record padding bytes could
cause an SSL client or server to send a limited amount of possibly
sensitive data to its SSL peer via the encrypted connection.
(CVE-2011-4576)

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of TLS/SSL
handshake restarts required to support Server Gated Cryptography. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL consume
an excessive amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake.
(CVE-2011-4619)

This update also fixes additional security issues in OpenSSL that are not
exposed in JBoss Enterprise Web Server: CVE-2011-4108, CVE-2012-0884,
CVE-2012-1165, and CVE-2012-2333.

Warning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise
Web Server installation (including all applications and configuration
files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Solaris and Microsoft
Windows as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply
this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Web Server installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The Apache HTTP Server must be restarted for this update to take effect.

RHSA-2012:1308 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2012-09-24
Updated:
2012-09-24
# RHSA-2012:1308 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: openssl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An update for the OpenSSL component for JBoss Enterprise Application
Platform 6.0.0 for Solaris and Microsoft Windows that fixes multiple
security issues is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

Multiple numeric conversion errors, leading to a buffer overflow, were
found in the way OpenSSL parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) data
from BIO (OpenSSL's I/O abstraction) inputs. Specially-crafted DER
(Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded data read from a file or other BIO
input could cause an application using the OpenSSL library to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2110)

A double free flaw was discovered in the policy checking code in OpenSSL.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash an application that uses
OpenSSL by providing an X.509 certificate that has specially-crafted
policy extension data. (CVE-2011-4109)

An information leak flaw was found in the SSL 3.0 protocol implementation
in OpenSSL. Incorrect initialization of SSL record padding bytes could
cause an SSL client or server to send a limited amount of possibly
sensitive data to its SSL peer via the encrypted connection.
(CVE-2011-4576)

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of TLS/SSL
handshake restarts required to support Server Gated Cryptography. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to make a TLS/SSL server using OpenSSL consume
an excessive amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake.
(CVE-2011-4619)

This update also fixes additional security issues in OpenSSL that are not
exposed in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform: CVE-2011-4108,
CVE-2012-0884, CVE-2012-1165, and CVE-2012-2333.

Warning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed applications, and
also back up your existing Apache HTTP Server installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

All users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.0 for Solaris and
Microsoft Windows as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised
to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform installation and deployed
applications, and also back up your existing Apache HTTP Server
installation (including all applications and configuration files).

The Apache HTTP Server, as well as JBoss server instances configured to use
the Tomcat Native library, must be restarted for this update to take
effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-19 11:09:02 UTC  ``` Quoting Tavis Ormandy's advisory "Incorrect integer conversions in OpenSSL can result in memory corruption.":    asn1_d2i_read_bio in OpenSSL contains multiple integer errors that can   cause memory corruption when parsing encoded ASN.1 data. This error can be   exploited on systems that parse untrusted data, such as X.509 certificates   or RSA public keys.  Reference: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Apr/210>  Tavis's post also provides link to an upstream advisory, which has not been published yet.  Fixes are not yet available in upstream CVS repository.  <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20120419.txt>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-19 11:17:26 UTC  ``` Created mingw32-openssl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 814203](show_bug.cgi?id=814203 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-2110 mingw32-openssl: asn1_d2i_read_bio integer errors leading to buffer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-19 11:17:30 UTC  ``` Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 814202](show_bug.cgi?id=814202 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2110 openssl: asn1_d2i_read_bio integer errors leading to buffer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-19 12:02:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c0))  > Fixes are not yet available in upstream CVS repository.

Affected functions are of the form d2i_*_bio or   d2i_*_fp, for example d2i_X509_bio or d2i_PKCS12_fp.    Applications using the memory based ASN1 functions (d2i_X509, d2i_PKCS12 etc)   are not affected. In particular the SSL/TLS code of OpenSSL is *not*   affected.    Applications only using the PEM routines are not affected.    S/MIME or CMS applications using the built in MIME parser SMIME_read_PKCS7   or SMIME_read_CMS *are* affected.    The OpenSSL command line utility is also affected if used to process   untrusted data in DER format.    Note: although an application using the SSL/TLS portions of OpenSSL is not   automatically affected it might still call a function such as d2i_X509_bio on   untrusted data and be vulnerable.  Fixed upstream in versions 1.0.1a, 1.0.0i and 0.9.8v.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-20 08:42:39 UTC  ``` OpenSSH upstream details on how OpenSSH is affected by this OpenSSL issue: <http://marc.info/?l=openssh-unix-dev&m=133483989311217&w=2>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-20 09:41:45 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20120419.txt>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-20 13:09:52 UTC  ``` Few notes on what is affected by this issue:  Upstream advisory mentions:    Applications using the memory based ASN1 functions (d2i_X509, d2i_PKCS12 etc)   are not affected. In particular the SSL/TLS code of OpenSSL is *not*   affected.  SSL/TLS code is mentioned explicitly as ASN.1 encoded data - server and possibly client X509 certificates - are transferred and parsed during the SSL/TLS handshake.  Those certificates are parsed using d2i_X509 function, which do not lead to a call of the affected asn1_d2i_read_bio function.  SSL/TLS server or client may call the affected function to load certificates or private keys.  Those inputs are usually trusted.  Additionally, applications may only support loading those from PEM encoded files.  Upstream advisory notes PEM routines are unaffected:    Applications only using the PEM routines are not affected.  Upstream advisory further notes that applications reading S/MIME or CMS files are affected:    S/MIME or CMS applications using the built in MIME parser SMIME_read_PKCS7   or SMIME_read_CMS *are* affected.  CMS format is only supported in openssl version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  Older versions do not have CMS support.  OCSP support in httpd/mod_ssl is affected affected by this issue, as it uses d2i_OCSP_RESPONSE_bio function.  OCSP response read from the network can trigger this issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-19 11:09:02 UTC  ``` Quoting Tavis Ormandy's advisory "Incorrect integer conversions in OpenSSL can result in memory corruption.":    asn1_d2i_read_bio in OpenSSL contains multiple integer errors that can   cause memory corruption when parsing encoded ASN.1 data. This error can be   exploited on systems that parse untrusted data, such as X.509 certificates   or RSA public keys.  Reference: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Apr/210>  Tavis's post also provides link to an upstream advisory, which has not been published yet.  Fixes are not yet available in upstream CVS repository.  <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20120419.txt>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-19 11:17:26 UTC  ``` Created mingw32-openssl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 814203](show_bug.cgi?id=814203 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-2110 mingw32-openssl: asn1_d2i_read_bio integer errors leading to buffer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-19 11:17:30 UTC  ``` Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 814202](show_bug.cgi?id=814202 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2110 openssl: asn1_d2i_read_bio integer errors leading to buffer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-19 12:02:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c0))  > Fixes are not yet available in upstream CVS repository.

Affected functions are of the form d2i_*_bio or   d2i_*_fp, for example d2i_X509_bio or d2i_PKCS12_fp.    Applications using the memory based ASN1 functions (d2i_X509, d2i_PKCS12 etc)   are not affected. In particular the SSL/TLS code of OpenSSL is *not*   affected.    Applications only using the PEM routines are not affected.    S/MIME or CMS applications using the built in MIME parser SMIME_read_PKCS7   or SMIME_read_CMS *are* affected.    The OpenSSL command line utility is also affected if used to process   untrusted data in DER format.    Note: although an application using the SSL/TLS portions of OpenSSL is not   automatically affected it might still call a function such as d2i_X509_bio on   untrusted data and be vulnerable.  Fixed upstream in versions 1.0.1a, 1.0.0i and 0.9.8v.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-20 08:42:39 UTC  ``` OpenSSH upstream details on how OpenSSH is affected by this OpenSSL issue: <http://marc.info/?l=openssh-unix-dev&m=133483989311217&w=2>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-20 09:41:45 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20120419.txt>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-20 13:09:52 UTC  ``` Few notes on what is affected by this issue:  Upstream advisory mentions:    Applications using the memory based ASN1 functions (d2i_X509, d2i_PKCS12 etc)   are not affected. In particular the SSL/TLS code of OpenSSL is *not*   affected.  SSL/TLS code is mentioned explicitly as ASN.1 encoded data - server and possibly client X509 certificates - are transferred and parsed during the SSL/TLS handshake.  Those certificates are parsed using d2i_X509 function, which do not lead to a call of the affected asn1_d2i_read_bio function.  SSL/TLS server or client may call the affected function to load certificates or private keys.  Those inputs are usually trusted.  Additionally, applications may only support loading those from PEM encoded files.  Upstream advisory notes PEM routines are unaffected:    Applications only using the PEM routines are not affected.  Upstream advisory further notes that applications reading S/MIME or CMS files are affected:    S/MIME or CMS applications using the built in MIME parser SMIME_read_PKCS7   or SMIME_read_CMS *are* affected.  CMS format is only supported in openssl version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  Older versions do not have CMS support.  OCSP support in httpd/mod_ssl is affected affected by this issue, as it uses d2i_OCSP_RESPONSE_bio function.  OCSP response read from the network can trigger this issue.  The httpd versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5 and 6 do not include OCSP support.  OCSP support in available in JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1 httpd packages.  Upstream advisory also notes that various openssl command's sub-commands can call affected asn1_d2i_read_bio function:    The OpenSSL command line utility is also affected if used to process   untrusted data in DER format.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c11)  Joe Orton    2012-04-20 15:53:25 UTC  ``` On the OCSP stapling code:   <http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=133493590915303>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=814185#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2012-04-24 08:08:41 UTC  ``` Upstream fix as included in 0.9.8v did not completely address this issue in OpenSSL versions 0.9.x.  This problem has now been corrected in 0.9.8w, see [bug #815661](show_bug.cgi?id=815661 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2012-2131 openssl: incomplete fix of CVE-2012-2110 for 0.9.x") / [CVE-2012-2131](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2131) for details.
