| Summary | 0014340: CVE-2012-2691 Reporters can update notes of other users by using SOAP API | | | | |
| Description | Reporters are not able to update notes of other users in a standard MantisBT configuration when using the web interface. This is the intended behaviour as the default setting for the access check is $g\_update\_bugnote\_threshold = DEVELOPER;  However the access check when using the SOAP API (function mc\_issue\_note\_update) uses option $g\_add\_bugnote\_threshold which defaults to REPORTER. This means that any reporter is able to remove the contents of all bugnotes!  Replacing $g\_add\_bugnote\_threshold by $g\_update\_bugnote\_threshold is not enough to solve the issue, as reporters will not be able to update their own notes. Checking that the id of the current user is the same id like the reporter id of the note is no clean solution, but acceptable and already used in source code at various places. (function access\_has\_bugnote\_level, bugnote\_edit\_page.php, …)  Example where this approach is no clean solution: User A (REPORTER) enters issue 1 with note 1 User A get's restricted to be a VIEWER Current implementation will still allow User A to edit note 1 because there are places in source code where access checking is only executed if current\_user\_id != bugnote\_reporter\_id  Quick solution: Add checks to function mc\_issue\_note\_update  Clean solution: Implement a helper function which returns true or false to check access rights. Use the function in SOAP and Web code | | | | |

Commit [edc8142](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/edc8142bb8ac0ac0df1a3824d78c15f4015d959e) introduced proper logic
to avoid unauthorized update of bugnotes, but was passing incorrect
parameters to access_has_bugnote_level() so unprivileged users could
still update them.

Fixes #14340

Fix #14340: Reporters can use SOAP to update bugnotes without permission

```
The access checks inside bugnote_update.php and
api/soap/mc_issue_api.php differed. Users were incorrectly allowed via
the SOAP interface to update the bugnotes of other users. Instead of
comparing the SOAP user's access level to $g_update_bugnote_threshold,
$g_add_bugnote_threshold was used instead.

This posed a problem because the default installed state of MantisBT is
to allow the REPORTER access level to submit bugs via the SOAP API. Thus
in the default installed state, any user who could submit a bug could
also update/modify the bugnotes of any other user.

Access checks within bugnote_update.php and api/soap/mc_issue_api.php
should now be equivalent.

Thanks to Roland Becker and Damien Regard (both MantisBT developers) for
finding and reporting this problem.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Fix #14340: Reporters can use SOAP to update bugnotes without permission

```
The access checks inside bugnote_update.php and
api/soap/mc_issue_api.php differed. Users were incorrectly allowed via
the SOAP interface to update the bugnotes of other users. Instead of
comparing the SOAP user's access level to $g_update_bugnote_threshold,
$g_add_bugnote_threshold was used instead.

This posed a problem because the default installed state of MantisBT is
to allow the REPORTER access level to submit bugs via the SOAP API. Thus
in the default installed state, any user who could submit a bug could
also update/modify the bugnotes of any other user.

Access checks within bugnote_update.php and api/soap/mc_issue_api.php
should now be equivalent.

Thanks to Roland Becker and Damien Regard (both MantisBT developers) for
finding and reporting this problem.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix #14340: Reporters can use SOAP to update bugnotes without permission

[Browse files](/mantisbt/mantisbt/tree/508cab0054e6ac62988bbe7fb5aa250239bd0d14)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
The access checks inside bugnote_update.php and
api/soap/mc_issue_api.php differed. Users were incorrectly allowed via
the SOAP interface to update the bugnotes of other users. Instead of
comparing the SOAP user's access level to $g_update_bugnote_threshold,
$g_add_bugnote_threshold was used instead.

This posed a problem because the default installed state of MantisBT is
to allow the REPORTER access level to submit bugs via the SOAP API. Thus
in the default installed state, any user who could submit a bug could
also update/modify the bugnotes of any other user.

Access checks within bugnote_update.php and api/soap/mc_issue_api.php
should now be equivalent.

Thanks to Roland Becker and Damien Regard (both MantisBT developers) for
finding and reporting this problem.

Message-ID: <1339229952.28538.22@d.hx.id.au>

Subject: CVE requests (x2) for Mantis Bug Tracker (MantisBT) before 1.2.11

CVE REQUEST #1

Title: Reporters can edit arbitrary bugnotes via SOAP API
Affected: MantisBT 1.2.10 and earlier versions
Not affected: MantisBT 1.2.11

Description:
Roland Becker and Damien Regad (MantisBT developers) found that any user
able to report issues via the SOAP interface could also modify any
bugnotes (comments) created by other users. In a default/typical
MantisBT installation, SOAP API is enabled and any user can sign up to
report new issues. This vulnerability therefore impacts upon many public
facing MantisBT installations.

CVE REQUEST #2

Title: delete_attachments_threshold not checked on attachment deletion
Affected: MantisBT 1.2.10 and earlier versions
Not affected: MantisBT 1.2.11

Description:
Roland Becker (MantisBT developer) found that the
delete_attachments_threshold permission was not being checked when a
user attempted to delete an attachment from an issue. The more generic
update_bug_threshold permission was being checked instead. MantisBT
administrators may have been under the false impression that their
configuration of the delete_attachments_threshold was successfully
preventing unwanted users from deleting attachments.

Commit [edc8142](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/edc8142bb8ac0ac0df1a3824d78c15f4015d959e) introduced proper logic
to avoid unauthorized update of bugnotes, but was passing incorrect
parameters to access_has_bugnote_level() so unprivileged users could
still update them.

Fixes #14340
