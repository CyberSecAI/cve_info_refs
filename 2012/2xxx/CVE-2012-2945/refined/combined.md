## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

# CVE-2012-2945 hadoop-env symlink vulnerability

---

*From*: "Simon ." <bofh666ftw () googlemail com>

*Date*: Sun, 1 Jul 2012 00:10:54 +0200

---

```
Software       : hadoop-1.0.3
Vulnerability  : Symlink
Problem type   : local
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2945
Date           : May 28, 2012
Affected       : min May 08, 2012

Symptom:

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk
$ file /tmp/hadoop-root-tasktracker.pid
/tmp/hadoop-root-tasktracker.pid: symbolic link to `/etc/passwd-'
$ sh bin/start-all.sh
starting namenode, logging to
/home/cloudopfer/src/hadoop-1.0.3/libexec/../logs/hadoop-root-namenode-t0.out
root@localhost's password:
localhost: starting datanode, logging to
/home/cloudopfer/src/hadoop-1.0.3/libexec/../logs/hadoop-root-datanode-t0.out
root@localhost's password:
localhost: starting secondarynamenode, logging to
/home/cloudopfer/src/hadoop-1.0.3/libexec/../logs/hadoop-root-secondarynamenode-t0.out
starting jobtracker, logging to
/home/cloudopfer/src/hadoop-1.0.3/libexec/../logs/hadoop-root-jobtracker-t0.out
root@localhost's password:
localhost: starting tasktracker, logging to
/home/cloudopfer/src/hadoop-1.0.3/libexec/../logs/hadoop-root-tasktracker-t0.out
$ tail -1 /etc/passwd-
10544

Problem:

$ grep tmp src/hadoop-1.0.3/conf/hadoop-env.sh
# The directory where pid files are stored. /tmp by default.

as pointed out by CVE Team:
"Incidentally, it seems that in Hadoop 1.x, only the
HADOOP_PID_DIR setting is affected, but in Hadoop 2.x, both the
HADOOP_PID_DIR and HADOOP_SECURE_DN_PID_DIR settings might be
affected:

<http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-2/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/conf/hadoop-env.sh>

 # The directory where pid files are stored. /tmp by default.
 export HADOOP_PID_DIR=${HADOOP_PID_DIR}
 export HADOOP_SECURE_DN_PID_DIR=${HADOOP_PID_DIR}
"

Solution:

Hadoop Cloud Specialists (lol) should edit conf/hadoop-env and change
the pid file directory to something sane.

Impact:

Low

Timeline:

May 25 - got drunk
May 26 - got drunk
May 27 - MARK -
May 28 - playing around with hadoop
       - notified security@
       - got reply, clarified things
Jul 01 - get rid of this ;)

Greetings:

To CVE Team!
To srm, Dude!
To the usual suspects
To those, who trust me.
To all who stay real.

Simon

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Hadoop is Java framework for building distributed, data-intensive applications.
Hadoop is modeled off of Google's MapReduce and Google File System (GFS)
publications. Writting and maintainted by the Apache Software Foundation,
Hadoop enables a cluster of machines to be integrated into a single
data-processing unit connected by a network. In addition to the core job
manager, Hadoop includes varuous tools to faciliate building large
data-processing applications:

 * HDFS - A distributed filesystem
 * HBase - A scaleable, distributed database
 * Chukwa - data collection system
 * Pig - data-flow language for parallel computation
 * ZooKeeper - high-availability coordination system
 * Hive - data warehouse infrastructure providing data querying and analysis

Subject: cloudera may be working on this
Date: Wed, 30 Sep 2009 16:46:05 +0200
```
Cloudera[1] already has Debian packages for hadoop, but these are not part of
Debian. On my question[2] they replied, that they would be working on getting
their packages shaped for Debian. However they did not yet reply to this RFP
as I asked them.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
