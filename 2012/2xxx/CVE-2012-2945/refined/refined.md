{
  "CVE-2012-2945": {
    "description": "Hadoop 1.0.3 contains a symlink vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The default directory for PID files in `conf/hadoop-env.sh` was set to `/tmp` which is world-writable and allows for creation of symlinks.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "symlink vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create a symlink in `/tmp` that points to a sensitive file. When Hadoop attempts to write a PID file to this location, it could overwrite the target of the symlink, potentially leading to data corruption or other security issues.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires local access to the system where Hadoop is installed and running.",
     "other_details": "The vulnerability exists because the HADOOP_PID_DIR variable in `conf/hadoop-env.sh` is set to `/tmp` by default. In Hadoop 2.x, both the `HADOOP_PID_DIR` and `HADOOP_SECURE_DN_PID_DIR` settings are affected."
