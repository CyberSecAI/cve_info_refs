Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stemmed from a mass-assignment issue in the Rails application used by GitHub. The application failed to properly sanitize incoming form parameters when updating public keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Mass Assignment:** The Rails application used `update_attributes` without whitelisting accessible attributes. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary parameters into the update process, including the `user_id` associated with a public key.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The backend did not validate or filter the incoming `public_key` parameters, specifically the nested `user_id`, allowing modification of data outside the user's intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Compromise:** The attacker was able to associate their public key with the Rails organization account, granting them full access to the organization's repositories.
*   **Code Injection:** The attacker demonstrated the vulnerability by pushing a new file to the Rails repository, showing they could read and write in any public or private repository of the compromised account.
*  **Potential for Further Damage:** The attacker could have potentially planted backdoors or performed other malicious activities before the vulnerability was patched.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Form Manipulation:** The attacker manipulated the public key update form by adding a hidden field: `<input value=USER_ID name=public_key[user_id]>` where `USER_ID` is the id of the target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needed to be able to interact with the public key update form and inject a hidden field.
*   **Knowledge of Rails:** Understanding the Rails framework's mass assignment vulnerability was required to craft the attack.
*   **GitHub User Account:** The attacker needed an account on GitHub to make the modifications.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was exploited by Egor Homakov, who added his public key to the Rails organization.
*   The issue was quickly fixed by Github, within an hour, and rails within 5 hours.
*  The blog post describes the events surrounding the exploit and the ethical questions it raised.
*   The GitHub blog post confirms the mass-assignment vulnerability as the root cause.
*   The GitHub post states the attacker compromised 3 accounts and that all affected parties have been contacted.
