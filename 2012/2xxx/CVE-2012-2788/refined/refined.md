Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2788:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content directly mentions "CVE-2012-2788" within the context of a list of CVEs fixed in FFmpeg 0.11. This confirms that the content is indeed related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

The provided content doesn't offer specific details on the root cause of CVE-2012-2788, only that it was fixed in ffmpeg 0.11. The most specific information comes from the mailing list message which mentions: *"Please recheck the page, ive added git hashes to them."* This suggests that code changes in git can help reveal the root cause of the vulnerability.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

Without specific details, we can only assume the existence of a security weakness that could be triggered while processing media files via FFmpeg. The vulnerabilities could be related to memory management (buffer overflows, use-after-free), logic errors, or other flaws in code that decodes specific media formats.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

Again, specifics are missing here. However, based on the context (security fixes in a media processing library), a potential impact of successful exploitation could include:
*   **Crash/Denial of Service:** A maliciously crafted media file could cause FFmpeg to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the vulnerability is severe enough, it could potentially lead to an attacker executing arbitrary code on the system, effectively taking control.

**5. Attack Vectors**

The attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted media files. This means an attacker would need to get the vulnerable FFmpeg to process the malicious data.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

To exploit this, an attacker would need to:
*   **Ability to Provide Media:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious media file to the application utilizing the vulnerable version of FFmpeg.
* **Knowledge:** Needs knowledge of how to trigger the vulnerability with crafted files

**Summary**

Based on the limited information available, CVE-2012-2788 refers to a security vulnerability that existed in FFmpeg and was fixed in version 0.11. The vulnerability is triggered when processing maliciously crafted media files and could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution. The primary attack vector is through malicious media files. However, the exact nature of the vulnerability remains unknown without further investigation and access to the referenced git commit data..
