| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=817437#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2012-04-30 02:45:38 UTC  ``` In JBoss AS 7.1.1 or later, property replacements in any descriptor ignores java security policies being used. If a user configures a security policy, it can be assumed that deployments cannot access properties unless a separate policy is specified. A malicious application could exploit this flaw to access such properties, potentially including properties from the security vault and environment variables.  Upstream bug: <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-8559>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=817437#c2)  David Jorm    2012-06-12 23:14:34 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw does not affect any Red Hat JBoss products, it only affects the JBoss AS 7.1.1 community release.   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
