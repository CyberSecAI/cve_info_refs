- Web-based attacks: An attacker can host a website with a malicious RTF file, and entice users to visit the site and open the file.
- Word Automation Services: A specially crafted RTF file could be placed in a SharePoint library and processed by Word Automation Services, leading to code execution within the service's context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted RTF file
- Ability to deliver this file to a target user, either via email or hosting on a web server
- In the case of Word Automation Services, the attacker would need to be able to upload a malicious file to a SharePoint library.
