      "details": "This document describes two vulnerabilities in Intuit QuickBooks 2009 through 2012:\n\n**1. File Disclosure Vulnerability:**\n  * **Root Cause:** The Intuit Help System protocol can be exploited using malicious HTML and JavaScript to retrieve files from ZIP archives.\n  * **Weaknesses:** The vulnerability stems from how the Intuit Help System handles file access within ZIP archives. It allows for retrieval of files if the attacker knows/guesses the path and file name of the target ZIP archive, and the target file it contains.\n  * **Impact:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive files on the local or network file system that the user has access to. \n   * **Attack Vectors:** Malicious HTML and JavaScript code loaded into the application. The attacker must know the path and filename of the target zip archive and target file it contains.\n  * **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to deliver malicious HTML and Javascript to a user and the target file must be in a location that the user's application has access to. Files in subdirectories inside of ZIP archives are not accessible, based on a sampling of Windows ZIPs, Microsoft Office 2007 documents, JARs, and APKs.\n\n**2. Heap Corruption and Memory Leak Vulnerability:**\n   * **Root Cause:** The Intuit Help System protocol has a vulnerability that can potentially be exploited by malicious HTML and JavaScript to cause heap corruption and a memory leak.\n   * **Weaknesses:** Improper handling of URLs by the Intuit Help System protocol. \n   *  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution as the user viewing the malicious content.\n   * **Attack Vectors:** Malicious HTML and/or Javascript.\n   * **Required Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to deliver malicious HTML and Javascript to a user."
