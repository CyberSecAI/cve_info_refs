Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2012-2551:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure in the Microsoft Kerberos implementation to properly handle a specially crafted session request. Specifically, a NULL pointer dereference can occur.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The Kerberos implementation in Microsoft Windows improperly handles a specially crafted session request, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause the affected system to stop responding and restart. The system becomes unavailable until it reboots.
*   The vulnerability does not allow for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted session request to the Kerberos server.
*   **Network-Based:** The attacker must be able to reach the Kerberos server over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network connectivity to reach the Kerberos server.
*   **Crafted Session Request:** The attacker must be capable of crafting a specific malicious Kerberos session request.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   Microsoft rated this vulnerability as "Important".
*   The vulnerability affects Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
*   Microsoft released security update KB2743555 to address this vulnerability.
*   Firewall best practices and standard configurations can help protect networks from external attacks, mitigating the risk.
*   No workarounds were identified.
*   Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability when the security bulletin was issued.
*   The update corrects how the Microsoft Kerberos implementation handles the specially crafted session.
