Understanding a Bug[¶](#understanding-a-bug \"Link to this heading\")\n\nThe core of Bugzilla is the screen which displays a particular\nbug. Note that the labels for most fields are hyperlinks;\nclicking them will take you to context-sensitive help on that\nparticular field. Fields marked * may not be present on every\ninstallation of Bugzilla.\n\n*Summary:*\n\nA one-sentence summary of the problem, displayed in the header next to\nthe bug number.\n\n*Status (and Resolution):*\n\nThese define exactly what state the bug is in—from not even\nbeing confirmed as a bug, through to being fixed and the fix\nconfirmed by Quality Assurance. The different possible values for\nStatus and Resolution on your installation should be documented in the\ncontext-sensitive help for those items.\n\n*Alias:*\n\nA unique short text name for the bug, which can be used instead of the\nbug number.\n\n*Product and Component*:\n\nBugs are divided up by Product and Component, with a Product\nhaving one or more Components in it.\n\n*Version:*\n\nThe “Version” field usually contains the numbers or names of released\nversions of the product. It is used to indicate the version(s) affected by\nthe bug report.\n\n*Hardware (Platform and OS):*\n\nThese indicate the computing environment where the bug was\nfound.\n\n*Importance (Priority and Severity):*\n\nThe Priority field is used to prioritize bugs, either by the assignee,\nor someone else with authority to direct their time such as a project\nmanager. It’s a good idea not to change this on other people’s bugs. The\ndefault values are P1 to P5.\n\nThe Severity field indicates how severe the problem is—from blocker\n(“application unusable”) to trivial (“minor cosmetic issue”). You\ncan also use this field to indicate whether a bug is an enhancement\nrequest.\n\n*\\*Target Milestone:*\n\nA future version by which the bug is to\nbe fixed. e.g. The Bugzilla Project’s milestones for future\nBugzilla versions are 4.4, 5.0, 6.0, etc. Milestones are not\nrestricted to numbers, though—you can use any text strings, such\nas dates.\n\n*Assigned To:*\n\nThe person responsible for fixing the bug.\n\n*\\*QA Contact:*\n\nThe person responsible for quality assurance on this bug.\n\n*URL:*\n\nA URL associated with the bug, if any.\n\n*\\*Whiteboard:*\n\nA free-form text area for adding short notes and tags to a bug.\n\n*Keywords:*\n\nThe administrator can define keywords which you can use to tag and\ncategorise bugs—e.g. `crash` or `regression`.\n\n*Personal Tags:*\n\nUnlike Keywords which are global and visible by all users, Personal Tags\nare personal and can only be viewed and edited by their author. Editing\nthem won’t send any notifications to other users. Use them to tag and keep\ntrack of sets of bugs that you personally care about, using your own\nclassification system.\n\n*Dependencies (Depends On and Blocks):*\n\nIf this bug cannot be fixed unless other bugs are fixed (depends\non), or this bug stops other bugs being fixed (blocks), their\nnumbers are recorded here.\n\nClicking the Dependency tree link shows\nthe dependency relationships of the bug as a tree structure.\nYou can change how much depth to show, and you can hide resolved bugs\nfrom this page. You can also collapse/expand dependencies for\neach non-terminal bug on the tree view, using the [-]/[+] buttons that\nappear before the summary.\n\n*Reported:*\n\nThe person who filed the bug, and the date and time they did it.\n\n*Modified:*\n\nThe date and time the bug was last changed.\n\n*CC List:*\n\nA list of people who get mail when the bug changes, in addition to the\nReporter, Assignee and QA Contact (if enabled).\n\n*Ignore Bug Mail:*\n\nSet this if you want never to get bugmail from this bug again. See also\n[Email Preferences](preferences.html#emailpreferences).\n\n*\\*See Also:*\n\nBugs, in this Bugzilla, other Bugzillas, or other bug trackers, that are\nrelated to this one.\n\n*Flags:*\n\nA flag is a kind of status that can be set on bugs or attachments\nto indicate that the bugs/attachments are in a certain state.\nEach installation can define its own set of flags that can be set\non bugs or attachments. See [Flags](#flags).\n\n*\\*Time Tracking:*\n\nThis form can be used for time tracking.\nTo use this feature, you have to be a member of the group\nspecified by the timetrackinggroup parameter. See\n[Time Tracking](editing.html#time-tracking) for more information.\n\nOrig. Est.:\n\nThis field shows the original estimated time.\n\nCurrent Est.:\n\nThis field shows the current estimated time.\nThis number is calculated from `Hours Worked`\nand `Hours Left`.\n\nHours Worked:\n\nThis field shows the number of hours worked.\n\nHours Left:\n\nThis field shows the `Current Est.` -\n`Hours Worked`.\nThis value + `Hours Worked` will become the\nnew Current Est.\n\n%Complete:\n\nThis field shows what percentage of the task is complete.\n\nGain:\n\nThis field shows the number of hours that the bug is ahead of the\n`Orig. Est.`.\n\nDeadline:\n\nThis field shows the deadline for this bug.\n\n*Attachments:*\n\nYou can attach files (e.g. test cases or patches) to bugs. If there\nare any attachments, they are listed in this section. See\n[Attachments](editing.html#attachments) for more information.\n\n*Additional Comments:*\n\nYou can add your two cents to the bug discussion here, if you have\nsomething worthwhile to say.\n\n## 2.3.1. Flags[¶](#flags \"Link to this heading\")\n\nFlags are a way to attach a specific status to a bug or attachment,\neither `+` or `-`. The meaning of these symbols depends on the name of\nthe flag itself, but contextually they could mean pass/fail,\naccept/reject, approved/denied, or even a simple yes/no. If your site\nallows requestable flags, then users may set a flag to `?` as a\nrequest to another user that they look at the bug/attachment and set\nthe flag to its correct status.\n\nA set flag appears in bug reports and on “edit attachment” pages with the\nabbreviated username of the user who set the flag prepended to the\nflag name. For example, if Jack sets a “review” flag to `+`, it appears\nas Jack: review [ + ].\n\nA requested flag appears with the user who requested the flag prepended\nto the flag name and the user who has been requested to set the flag\nappended to the flag name within parentheses. For example, if Jack\nasks Jill for review, it appears as Jack: review [ ? ] (Jill).\n\nYou can browse through open requests made of you and by you by selecting\nMy Requests from the footer. You can also look at open requests\nlimited by other requesters, requestees, products, components, and flag names.\nNote that you can use ‘-’ for requestee to specify flags with no requestee\nset.\n\n### 2.3.1.1. A Simple Example[¶](#a-simple-example \"Link to this heading\")\n\nA developer might want to ask their manager,\n“Should we fix this bug before we release version 2.0?”\nThey might want to do this for a *lot* of bugs,\nso they decide to streamline the process. So:\n\n1.  The Bugzilla administrator creates a flag type called blocking2.0 for bugs\n    in your product. It shows up on the Show Bug screen as the text\n    blocking2.0 with a drop-down box next to it. The drop-down box\n    contains four values: an empty space, `?`, `-`, and `+`.\n2.  The developer sets the flag to `?`.\n3.  The manager sees the blocking2.0\n    flag with a `?` value.\n4.  If the manager thinks the feature should go into the product\n    before version 2.0 can be released, they set the flag to\n    `+`. Otherwise, they set it to `-`.\n5.  Now, every Bugzilla user who looks at the bug knows whether or\n    not the bug needs to be fixed before release of version 2.0.\n\n### 2.3.1.2. About Flags[¶](#about-flags \"Link to this heading\")\n\nFlags can have four values:\n\n`?`\n\nA user is requesting that a status be set. (Think of it as ‘A question is being asked’.)\n\n`-`\n\nThe status has been set negatively. (The question has been answered `no`.)\n\n`+`\n\nThe status has been set positively.\n(The question has been answered `yes`.)\n\n`_`\n\n`unset` actually shows up as a blank space. This just means that nobody\nhas expressed an opinion (or asked someone else to express an opinion)\nabout the matter covered by this flag.\n\n### 2.3.1.3. Flag Requests[¶](#flag-requests \"Link to this heading\")\n\nIf a flag has been defined as requestable, and a user has enough\nprivileges to request it (see below), the user can set the flag’s status to\n`?`. This status indicates that someone (a.k.a. “the requester”) is asking\nsomeone else to set the flag to either `+` or `-`.\n\nIf a flag has been defined as specifically requestable,\na text box will appear next to the flag into which the requester may\nenter a Bugzilla username. That named person (a.k.a. “the requestee”)\nwill receive an email notifying them of the request, and pointing them\nto the bug/attachment in question.\n\nIf a flag has *not* been defined as specifically requestable,\nthen no such text box will appear. A request to set this flag cannot be made\nof any specific individual; these requests are open for anyone to answer. In\nBugzilla this is known as “asking the wind”. A requester may ask the wind on\nany flag simply by leaving the text box blank.\n\n### 2.3.1.4. Attachment Flags[¶](#attachment-flags \"Link to this heading\")\n\nThere are two types of flags: bug flags and attachment flags.\n\nAttachment flags are used to ask a question about a specific\nattachment on a bug.\n\nMany Bugzilla installations use this to\nrequest that one developer review another\ndeveloper’s code before they check it in. They attach the code to\na bug report, and then set a flag on that attachment called\nreview to\nreview? reviewer@example.com.\nreviewer@example.com is then notified by email that\nthey have to check out that attachment and approve it or deny it.\n\nFor a Bugzilla user, attachment flags show up in three places:\n\n1.  On the list of attachments in the Show Bug\n    screen, you can see the current state of any flags that\n    have been set to `?`, `+`, or `-`. You can see who asked about\n    the flag (the requester), and who is being asked (the\n    requestee).\n2.  When you edit an attachment, you can\n    see any settable flag, along with any flags that have\n    already been set. The Edit Attachment\n    screen is where you set flags to `?`, `-`, `+`, or unset them.\n3.  Requests are listed in the Request Queue, which\n    is accessible from the My Requests link (if you are\n    logged in) or Requests link (if you are logged out)\n    visible on all pages.\n\n### 2.3.1.5. Bug Flags[¶](#bug-flags \"Link to this heading\")\n\nBug flags are used to set a status on the bug itself. You can\nsee Bug Flags in the Show Bug and Requests\nscreens, as described above.\n\nOnly users with enough privileges (see below) may set flags on bugs.\nThis doesn’t necessarily include the assignee, reporter, or users with the\neditbugs permission.\n\n---\n\nThis documentation undoubtedly has bugs; if you find some, please file\nthem [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla&component=Documentation).\n\n[![Logo of Bugzilla](../_static/bugzilla.png)](../index.html)\n\n### [Table of Contents](../index.html)\n\n* 2.3.
