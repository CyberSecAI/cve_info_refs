The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Netgear ProSafe Wireless-N 8-port Gigabit VPN Firewall FVS318N router. However, the CVE ID is not provided on the page, and is likely not CVE-2012-2439, based on the description. The vulnerability is identified by the Vulnerability Note VU#928795.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The remote management feature of the Netgear FVS318N router is enabled by default, allowing access to the administrator web interface from the WAN.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Default configuration exposes the administrative web interface to the internet (WAN).
- Lack of authentication is not explicitly mentioned but implied because the vulnerability is described as "unauthenticated attacker may be able to access".

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially access the administrator web interface of the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack via the WAN interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to reach the router's WAN IP address.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to access the administrative interface and to perform further actions once logged in.
