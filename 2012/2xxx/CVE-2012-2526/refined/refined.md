Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-2526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) handles objects in memory. Specifically, it occurs when RDP attempts to access an object in memory after that object has already been deleted. This is a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the RDP protocol.
- Improper memory management in RDP packet processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- Complete system compromise: This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted RDP packets: An attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a sequence of crafted RDP packets to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker: The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker must be able to send RDP packets to the target system over a network, typically via TCP port 3389.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected systems are those with RDP enabled (typically Windows XP Service Pack 3).
- Systems without RDP enabled are not directly at risk but will still be offered the update.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how RDP processes packets in memory.
- Mitigation includes blocking TCP port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall.
- Workarounds include disabling the Remote Desktop feature if not required.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index rated this vulnerability as "Exploitation More Likely" after it became known that exploit code could be created that could consistently exploit the vulnerability, and there was awareness of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited.
