## Remote Desktop Protocol Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2526

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Remote Desktop Protocol accesses an object in memory after it has been deleted. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-2526](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-2526).

#### Mitigating Factors for Remote Desktop Protocol Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2526

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, the Remote Desktop Protocol is not enabled on any Windows operating system. Systems that do not have RDP enabled are not at risk. Note that on Windows XP, Remote Assistance can enable RDP.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems connected directly to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for Remote Desktop Protocol Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2526

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall**

  TCP port 3389 is used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking this port at the network perimeter firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. This can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Blocking the affected ports at the enterprise perimeter is the best defense to help avoid Internet-based attacks. However, systems could still be vulnerable to attacks from within their enterprise perimeter.

  On Windows XP, the Windows Firewall can help protect individual systems. By default, the Windows Firewall does not allow connections to this port, except in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Service Pack 3 when the Remote Desktop feature is enabled. For information about how to disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop on these platforms, see the TechNet article, [Enable or Disable the Remote Desktop Firewall Rule](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc736451.aspx). If you cannot disable the Windows Firewall exception for Remote Desktop, you may be able to reduce the scope of this vulnerability by setting the default value of all computers (including those on the Internet), to the local network. Doing this helps reduce the likelihood of attacks from the Internet.

  **Note** It is possible to manually change the affected components to use other ports. If you have performed these actions, you should also block those additional ports.
* **Disable Remote Desktop feature if no longer required**

  If you no longer need these services on your system, consider disabling them as a security best practice. Disabling unused and unneeded services helps reduce your exposure to security vulnerabilities.

  For information about how to disable Remote Desktop manually, see [To disable Remote Desktop](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/rdesktop_disable.mspx).

  For information about how to disable Remote Desktop by using Group Policy, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 306300](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/306300).

  For information about Remote Assistance, including instructions on how to disable Remote Assistance manually and by using Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Remote Assistance](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb457177.aspx).

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

Procedures for Disabling Remote Assistance

### Benefits and Purposes of Remote Assistance

With Microsoft Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2 (SP2), a user or administrator can use Remote Assistance to get help from a member of the organization's support staff. Users or administrators can also collaborate in other ways through screen sharing. Remote Assistance is a convenient way for support professionals to connect to a computer from another computer running a compatible operating system, such as Windows XP, and to show the users or administrators a solution to their problem.

Using Windows Messenger Service or an e-mail program, such as Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express, you can provide support to users by connecting to their computer. After you are connected, you can view the userâs computer screen, communicate in real time about what you both see on the userâs computer, send files, use voice communication, and use your mouse and keyboard to work on the userâs computer.

### Overview: Using Remote Assistance in a Managed Environment

Through Help and Support Center users can access Remote Assistance by default and have someone inside or outside your network connect to their computer. In Help and Support Center, users can click **Invite a friend to connect to your computer with Remote Assistance** or click **Tools\Remote Assistance**.

Although a firewall on your organizationâs network will likely prevent outsiders from connecting directly to a computer on your intranet, it is possible for users to connect remotely to someone within your intranet or outside your network through Remote Assistance. As an administrator in a highly managed environment, you might want to prevent users from using this feature. You can do this during your deployment of Windows XP with SP2, or post-deployment using Group Policy.

In a domain environment there is also the option of a support person or IT administrator offering unsolicited assistance. From Help and Support Center using **Tools\Offer Remote Assistance**, an administrator in the domain may offer assistance to users in the same domain or trusted domains without being asked. However, users can decline the invitation. This capability can be strictly controlled with Group Policy. Controlling the use of unsolicited as well as solicited Remote Assistance is described further in the subsection "Controlling Remote Assistance to Prevent the Flow of Information to and from the Internet."

### How Remote Assistance Communicates with Sites on the Internet

When a user (referred to as the "novice") initiates a request for assistance through either the e-mail option or the **Save invitation as a file** option in Remote Assistance, Windows XP starts Help and Support Center. Help and Support Center then passes the information to Remote Assistance.

When the person who is being contacted (the "expert") accepts the invitation from the novice, Remote Assistance calls Help and Support Center application programming interfaces (APIs) to initiate the session. Help and Support Center relies on Terminal Services to negotiate the session. Help and Support Center passes the Remote Assistance invitation (the "ticket") file to Terminal Services. The Remote Assistance session is established using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), and uses port 3389 through Terminal Services on the novice computer.

There are safeguards built into the Remote Assistance feature. All sessions are encrypted and can be password-protected. The novice (user soliciting the assistance) sets the maximum time for the duration of the ticket. Also, firewalls on your organizationâs network can be configured to prevent communication associated with Remote Assistance, for example, Remote Assistance connections that are inbound to computers behind the firewall. Note that Windows XP with SP2 includes enhancements to the firewall component, now called Windows Firewall. For information about how Windows Firewall interacts with Remote Assistance, see the link to âDeploying Windows Firewall Settings for Windows XP SP2â on the Microsoft TechNet Web site at:

[https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=23354](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=23354)

The following information presents additional details on how information transfer over the Internet takes place when a connection is made:

* **Specific information sent or received**: Information that is transmitted in a Remote Assistance ticket includes user name, IP address, and computer name. Information necessary to provide functionality for Remote Assistance (for example, screen sharing, file transfer, and voice) is sent in real time using point-to-point connections.
* **Default and recommended settings**: Anyone with access to Help and Support Center can access the Remote Assistance feature. Users can prevent someone from connecting to their computer by declining an invitation. You can also prevent someone from remotely controlling a computer running Windows XP with SP2 by using Control Panel settings or Group Policy.
* **Triggers**: A user establishes contact with the expert by sending an invitation through e-mail, instant messaging, or by saving an invitation as a file and transferring it manually, such as on a floppy disk, to the expert. Or, an expert offers unsolicited assistance to a user.
* **User notification**: Whether assistance is solicited or unsolicited, the novice is notified of the offer of assistance from the expert. The novice must accept the connection before Remote Assistance begins.
* **Logging**: Events such as a user initiating a connection or a user accepting or rejecting an invitation are recorded in the event logs. Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) records more details than were recorded in the previous service pack, including events such as taking and releasing control. sending and accepting files, and ticket creation and deletion. SP2 also records details such as whether assistance is solicited or unsolicited as well as more detailed user name and IP address information.
* **Encryption**: The RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) encryption algorithm for the main Remote Assistance communication and the RTC (Real-Time Communication) encryption algorithm for voice are used. The RDP encryption algorithm is RC4 128-bit.
* **Access**: No information is stored at Microsoft.
* **Transmission protocol and port**: The port is 3389 and the transmission protocols are RDP and RTC. For Offer Remote Assistance, Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) is also used.
* **Ability to disable**: This component can be disabled by using Group Policy or locally through Control Panel.
* **Firewall protection**: Any firewall that blocks port 3389 will not allow a Remote Assistance connection to users outside the firewall. This does not prevent users from within the network protected by the firewall from connecting to each other. If you close port 3389, you will block all Remote Desktop and Terminal Services events through it as well. If you want to allow these services but want to limit Remote Assistance requests, use Group Policy. If the port is opened only for outbound traffic, a user can request Remote Assistance by using Windows Messenger.

For more information about the Remote Assistance connection process, see article 300692, "Description of the Remote Assistance Connection Process" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base at:

[https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=29212](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=29212)

### Controlling Remote Assistance to Prevent the Flow of Information to and from the Internet

Administrators can control the use of Remote Assistance in the following ways:

* Group Policy to prevent Remote Assistance from being solicited from this computer
* Group Policy to prevent unsolicited Remote Assistance from being offered to this computer
* Local control of Remote Assistance through Control Panel

Group Policy settings are described in detail in this subsection. Procedures for disabling Remote Assistance are presented in the next subsection.

#### Using Group Policy

There are two Group Policy settings you can configure to control the use of Remote Assistance:

* **Solicited Remote Assistance**

  Use this policy setting to determine whether Remote Assistance can be solicited from a given computer. In **Solicited Remote Assistance** the user of a computer explicitly requests help from another party.
* **Offer Remote Assistance**

  Use this policy setting to determine whether a support person or IT administrator (expert) can offer remote assistance to a computer without a user explicitly requesting it first through e-mail, a file, or instant messaging.

These policy settings are located in Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Remote Assistance. Configuration options for these policy settings are described in the following table.

**Group Policy Settings for Controlling Remote Assistance**

| Policy Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Solicited Remote Assistance** (enabled) | When this policy setting is enabled, a user can create a Remote Assistance invitation that a person (âexpertâ) can use at another computer to connect to the userâs computer. If given permission, the expert can view the userâs screen, mouse, and keyboard activity in real time.  Additional configuration options are available when you enable this policy setting. |
| **Solicited Remote Assistance** (disabled) | If the status is set to **Disabled**, users cannot request Remote Assistance and this computer cannot be controlled from another computer. |
| **Solicited Remote Assistance** (not configured) | If the status is set to Not Configured, the configuration of solicited Remote Assistance is determined by the Control Panel settings. |
| **Offer Remote Assistance** (enabled) | When this policy setting is enabled, a remote user or administrator can offer Remote Assistance to the computer. When you configure this policy setting, you have two choices: you can select either **Allow helpers to only view the computer** or **Allow helpers to remotely control the computer**. In addition to making this selection, when you configure this policy setting, you also specify the list of users or user groups that will be allowed to offer remote assistance. Administrators of this computer can offer remote assistance to it by default. They do not need to be added to the list. |
| **Offer Remote Assistance** (disabled or not configured) | If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, users or groups cannot offer unsolicited remote assistance to this computer. |

For additional configuration options, see the Remote Assistance policy settings in Group Policy. To find more information about editing Group Policy, see Appendix B, "Learning About Group Policy and Updating Administrative Templates."

### Procedures for Disabling Remote Assistance

This section presents procedures administrators can use for disabling Remote Assistance through Group Policy or Control Panel.
