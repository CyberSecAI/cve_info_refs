  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "Apache CXF checks to ensure XML elements were signed or encrypted by a Supporting Token, but not whether the correct token was used. This flaw applies to both WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 and 1.2 policies.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper enforcement of security policies",
         "Incorrect validation of Supporting Tokens"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could transmit confidential information without the appropriate security, and potentially circumvent access controls on web services exposed via Apache CXF.  A client could fail to sign or encrypt certain elements as directed by a security policy, leading to information disclosure and insecure information transmission.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "A remote attacker exploits the vulnerability through the XML structure and token usage in web services requests."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker with the ability to transmit confidential information without the appropriate security.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability is not exploitable on JBoss AS 7 and EAP 6. It will be fixed as a defense in depth measure in these products, but does not constitute a security flaw. This flaw is only exploitable on products based on EAP 5. \n\nIf you use the affected configuration, an exception will be thrown and the relevant application will not deploy to the server. A patch that allows the affected configuration to be used without this vulnerability is available in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1.\n\nThis issue has been addressed in following products: JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0, JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 and JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1, JBEAP 5 for RHEL 4,5,6, JBEWP 5 for RHEL 4,5,6 and JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.0.1"
