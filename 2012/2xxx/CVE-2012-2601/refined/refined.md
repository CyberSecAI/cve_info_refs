Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2601:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `WrVMwareHostList.asp` file of Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 15.02.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `sGroupList` parameter of `WrVMwareHostList.asp`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code that can be executed by the database. The vulnerability is "blind" because the attacker doesn't receive direct output from the SQL query, but can infer results based on time delays (e.g., `WAITFOR DELAY`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By leveraging the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can enable `xp_cmdshell` (if available), upload a malicious DLL (reverse shell), and execute it to gain remote code execution on the server.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The exploit can be used to add a new database administrator, potentially leading to further control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `sGroupList` parameter in the URL of `WrVMwareHostList.asp`.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The attacker uses techniques like `WAITFOR DELAY` to determine if their injected SQL is being executed, since direct results are not returned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `WrVMwareHostList.asp` file.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL Injection:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL statements to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) script demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability, including steps to:
    *   Enable `xp_cmdshell`.
    *   Upload a reverse shell DLL by writing it to a hex file and then using `debug` to convert it to a DLL.
    *   Execute the reverse shell.

The provided information gives a deeper understanding of the vulnerability by explaining not only how to exploit it but also providing a complete end-to-end attack chain that results in remote code execution.
