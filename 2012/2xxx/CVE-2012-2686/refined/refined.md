      "content": "The provided content includes information about CVE-2012-2686.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of CBC ciphersuites in TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 on AES-NI (Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions) supporting platforms.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OpenSSL had a flaw in handling CBC ciphersuites specifically in TLS 1.1 and 1.2 when using AES-NI.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit of this flaw could result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.\n\n**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered during the TLS handshake process when using CBC ciphersuites and AES-NI. An attacker could likely manipulate the handshake to cause the vulnerable code path to be taken, leading to the denial of service.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to initiate a TLS connection to a vulnerable server using a CBC ciphersuite with TLS 1.1 or 1.2 and the server must have AES-NI support. The attacker would need to be able to communicate over the network with the vulnerable server.",
      "additional_information": "The bugzilla entry indicates that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 were not affected as they did not include support for TLS 1.2 or 1.1. The fix for this issue is included in a changeset that also addresses CVE-2013-0169. The Apple document mentions this vulnerability was addressed by updating OpenSSL to version 0.9.8y."
