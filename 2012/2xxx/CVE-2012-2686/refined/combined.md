| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=908029#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-05 17:09:54 UTC  ``` A flaw in the OpenSSL handling of CBC ciphersuites in TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 on AES-NI (Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions) supporting platforms [1] can be exploited in a DoS attack.  Anyone using an AES-NI platform for TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1 on OpenSSL 1.0.1c is affected. Platforms which do not support AES-NI or versions of OpenSSL which do not implement TLS 1.2 or 1.1 (for example OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.0) are not affected.  [1] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES-NI#Supporting_CPUs>   External References:  <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20130205.txt>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=908029#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-05 17:14:08 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of OpenSSL as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did not include support for TLS 1.2 or 1.1.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=908029#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-02-05 17:14:52 UTC  ``` Created openssl tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-18 [[bug 908032](show_bug.cgi?id=908032 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2686 openssl: DoS due to improper handling of CBC ciphersuites in TLS 1.1/1.2 on AES-NI supporting platforms [fedora-18]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=908029#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2013-02-06 13:28:13 UTC  ``` Fix for this is included as part of the changeset which is one of the several changesets added to address [CVE-2013-0169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-0169) in OpenSSL ([bug 907589](show_bug.cgi?id=907589 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-0169 SSL/TLS: CBC padding timing attack (lucky-13)")):  <http://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=125093b59f3c2a2d33785b5563d929d0472f1721>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
