## Johnson Controls CK721-A and P2000 remote command execution vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#977312

Original Release Date: 2012-07-13 | Last Revised: 2013-04-03

---

### Overview

Johnson Controls CK721-A and P2000 products contain a remote command execution vulnerability which may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to perform various tasks against the devices.

### Description

| The "download" port (tcp/41014) on the CK721-A device is vulnerable to remote command execution. An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted packets to the port to instruct it to perform various tasks like unlocking a door, adding badges, or changing the configuration which could grant physical access to a secured area to the attacker without requiring valid credentials to the product.  The "upload" port (tcp/41013) P2000 (Pegasys) servers which is used for logging and alerting purposes is vulnerable to false alerts injections. The server accepts any messages sent to it with the only verification being the source IP address. An attacker can send specially crafted packets to the port that provides false access data to the server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the CK721-A device can instruct it to perform various tasks like unlocking a door, adding badges, or changing the configuration which could grant physical access to a secured area. An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the P2000 (Pegasys) servers device can instruct it to log false alerts causing legitimate alerts to be harder to spot. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**The vendor has stated the following:*Vulnerability VU#977212 is addressed through the deployment of strong encryption, such as AES, for all IP based, bi-directional communications, on all ports, between CK-721 type controllers and the P2000 Security host server. The encryption methodology used by Johnson Controls Inc. supports the FIPS 140-2 standard, with reference validation certificates No. 1051 for controllers and No. 1336 for the server. The process to implement encryption has four steps as follows:Step 1\tUpgrade of the P2000 server security application software, to version P2000 V 3.11, P2K-SW-CORE 311. P/N 27-5618-3. Service Pack 3Step 2\tUpgrade of the hardware module, of the CK-721 controller, to version CK-721A. P/N 27-5379-1044Step 3\tUpgrade of the controller firmware, to current version. SSM4388\_03.1.0.17\_BB Step 4\tActivation of encryption, as per the standard documentation. P/N 24-10618-147 Rev. AThe use of encryption is considered a security industry best practice, and is recommended at all times.Additional information and support can be obtained by contacting JCI Customer Service, at 800-229-4076* |

| **Restrict Access**Implement appropriate firewall rules to block traffic from untrusted sources to TCP port 41013 and TCP port 41014. |
