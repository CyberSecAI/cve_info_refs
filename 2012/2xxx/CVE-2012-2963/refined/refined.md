Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-2963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The BreakingPoint Systems Control Center GUI and administrative clients communicate in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Plaintext communication: All information exchanged between the client and server, including usernames and passwords, are sent in plain text XML transfers over TCP port 8880. This lack of encryption exposes sensitive data during transmission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can intercept and gather sensitive configuration information, including account credentials and session authentication tokens, by eavesdropping on network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network eavesdropping: An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and server can capture the plaintext communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to monitor network traffic between the BreakingPoint Systems Control Center GUI and administrative clients and the server, such as being on the same network or a man-in-the-middle position.
