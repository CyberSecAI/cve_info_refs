  "CVE-2012-2673": {
    "description": "It was discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in the malloc and calloc implementations in the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collecting memory allocator (libgc). These could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflows in the malloc and calloc implementations of the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage collecting memory allocator (libgc).",

        "Integer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker could provide specially crafted application-specific input which, when processed by the application, could lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution."

    "patch_details": [
      "Patches were applied to correct the integer overflow issues in malloc() and calloc()."
     ],
    "additional_notes": [
      "The vulnerability exists in the malloc and calloc routines when an application using libgc did not implement application-level validity checks for the parameters.",
      "The integer overflows could lead to an application crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "Several commits on github relate to fixing the issue."
