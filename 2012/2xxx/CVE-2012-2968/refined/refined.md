Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-2968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability lies in the way Caucho's Quercus on Resin handles file downloads. It improperly sanitizes filenames, allowing the insertion of "../" sequences within the file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization when handling filenames during file downloads. The software doesn't prevent the injection of ".." path traversal sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to download files from arbitrary directories within the server's file system. This can potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive information like configuration files, source code or other data, depending on the server's configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Forging:** The attack is performed by crafting malicious HTTP requests that contain the "../" sequences within the filename parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
