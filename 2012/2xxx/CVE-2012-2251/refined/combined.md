Package        : rssh
Vulnerability  : insufficient filtering of rsync command line
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2251 CVE-2012-2252
Debian Bug     :

James Clawson discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for OpenSSH to be used
with scp/sftp, rdist and cvs, was not correctly filtering command line options.
This could be used to force the execution of a remote script and thus allow
arbitrary command execution. Two CVE were assigned:

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of command line when using rsync protocol. It was
	for example possible to pass dangerous options after a "--" switch. The rsync
	protocol support has been added in a Debian (and Fedora/Red Hat) specific
	patch, so this vulnerability doesn't affect upstream.

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of the "--rsh" option: the filter preventing usage of the
	"--rsh=" option would not prevent passing "--rsh". This vulnerability affects
	upstream code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.2-13squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=877279#c0)  James Clawson    2012-11-16 06:38:43 UTC  ``` Description of problem: rssh 2.3.3-3 as found in fc17 seems to insufficiently filter the -e option when using rsync. The regular expression is flawed and permits rsync to be invoked as a client with the -e option as long as the argument is a relative path and does not contain the letter 'e'.   Here is an example of a command that will be permitted by rssh: rsync -e./script.sh  localhost:/tmp--server ./  rsync (at least version 3.0.9-4) will attempt to execute ./script.sh when invoked this way.  Placing a space after the -e results in the command being rejected as expected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=877279#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-20 15:30:01 UTC  ``` Thank you for your report, James.  The above behaviour is documented in the rssh manual page (section Command Line Parser):   "As of rssh version 2.2.3, the program must parse out the complete command line to avoid command line options which cause the execution of arbitrary programs (and  hence  bypass  the  security of rssh). In order to keep the program source code sane, the parser is a little over-zealous about matching command line options.  In practice, this probably will not be an issue, but in theory it is possible.  If you run into a problem where rssh refuses to run, claiming to be rejecting insecure command line options which were not specified, try changing your command line such that all short options are specified as single-letter option flags (e.g. -e -p instead of -ep) and make sure you separate arguments from their respective options by a space (e.g. -p 123 instead of -p123). In virtually all cases, this should solve the problem. Admittedly, an exhaustive search was not performed, but no problematical cases were found which were likely to be common.  The alternative would have been to include a complete command-line parser for rcp, rdist, and rsync; this was way out of the scope of this project. In practice, the existing parser should suffice. If, however, you find cases where it does not, please post details to the rssh mailing list. Details about how to post to the mailing list can be found at the rssh homepage."  To get this bug correct, you should report the above use case to rssh mailing list, as suggested above.  Since this issue is triggerable via command line only and depends on the position of argument provided after the -e option, it is not a security flaw.  But I have kept this bug report in private group to keep it private (since it was originally reported that way).

The issue is that the command is not being rejected when it should be.  FYI: I saw that the debian version is vulnerable as well and submitted a patch for it (it was a one line fix for their version). The (debian) package maintainer added to the patch and is testing it right now. Their patch can be used as the basis for a fix for the FC version.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=877279#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-20 17:37:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=877279#c4))  Thanks.

So right now the status is we are waiting for the Debian maintainer to provide a patch. Or should we (Red Hat Security Response Team) contact Derek Martin / upstream directly to provide a patch (he mentions direct contact in the manual page and we have previous experiences with cooperation with him, so can do that if you wish / if it's desired).  Just let us know.

Subject: rssh: incorrect filtering of command line options

Hi people,

I've just released DSA 2578-1 which affects rssh after coordination on
the distro list and I'm now posting to oss-sec per policy.

Package        : rssh
Vulnerability  : incorrect filtering of command line options
Problem type   : remote
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2251 CVE-2012-2252

James Clawson discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for OpenSSH to be used
with scp/sftp, rdist and cvs, was not correctly filtering command line options.
This could be used to force the execution of a remote script and thus allow
arbitrary command execution. Two CVE were assigned:

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of command line when using rsync protocol. It was
	for example possible to pass dangerous options after a "--" switch. The rsync
	protocol support has been added in a Debian (and Fedora/Red Hat) specific
	patch, so this vulnerability doesn't affect upstream.

CVE-2012-2251
	Incorrect filtering of the "--rsh" option: the filter preventing usage of the
	"--rsh=" option would not prevent passing "--rsh". This vulnerability affects
	upstream code.

Regards,
--

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
