# About the security content of iOS 6.1 Software Update

This document describes the security content of iOS 6.1.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see [How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620).

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see [Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222).

## iOS 6.1

* **Identity Services**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Authentication relying on certificate-based Apple ID authentication may be bypassed

  Description: An error handling issue existed in Identity Services. If the user's AppleID certificate failed to validate, the user's AppleID was assumed to be the empty string. If multiple systems belonging to different users enter this state, applications relying on this identity determination may erroneously extend trust. This issue was addressed by ensuring that NULL is returned instead of an empty string.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0963

* **International Components for Unicode**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A canonicalization issue existed in the handling of the EUC-JP encoding, which could lead to a cross-site scripting attack on EUC-JP encoded websites. This issue was addressed by updating the EUC-JP mapping table.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3058 : Masato Kinugawa

* **Kernel**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: A user-mode process may be able to access the first page of kernel memory

  Description: The iOS kernel has checks to validate that the user-mode pointer and length passed to the copyin and copyout functions would not result in a user-mode process being able to directly access kernel memory. The checks were not being used if the length was smaller than one page. This issue was addressed through additional validation of the arguments to copyin and copyout.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0964 : Mark Dowd of Azimuth Security

* **Security**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: Several intermediate CA certificates were mistakenly issued by TURKTRUST. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other sensitive information. This issue was addressed by not allowing the incorrect SSL certificates.

* **StoreKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: JavaScript may be enabled in Mobile Safari without user interaction

  Description: If a user disabled JavaScript in Safari Preferences, visiting a site which displayed a Smart App Banner would re-enable JavaScript without warning the user. This issue was addressed by not enabling JavaScript when visiting a site with a Smart App Banner.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0974 : Andrew Plotkin of Zarfhome Software Consulting, Ben Madison of BitCloud, Marek Durcek

* **WebKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple memory corruption issues existed in WebKit. These issues were addressed through improved memory handling.

* **WebKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Copying and pasting content on a malicious website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A cross-site scripting issue existed in the handling of content pasted from a different origin. This issue was addressed through additional validation of pasted content.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0962 : Mario Heiderich of Cure53

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2012/09/stable-channel-update_25.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, September 25, 2012

The Chrome Team is excited to announce the promotion of Chrome 22 to the stable channel.  Chrome 22.0.1229.79 (also now available on the beta channel) has a number of new and exciting updates including:

* Mouse Lock API availability for Javascript
* Additional Windows 8 enhancements
* Continued polish for users of HiDPI/Retina screens

You can find out more about Chrome 22 on the [Official Chrome Blog](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2012/09/a-chrome-update-with-side-of-gaming.html).

**Security fixes and rewards:

Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.

Occasionally, we issue special rewards for bugs outside of Chrome, particularly where the bug is very severe and/or we are able to partially work around the issue:**

**Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer).

We’d also like to thank Arthur Gerkis for working with us during the development cycle and preventing security regressions from ever reaching the stable channel.**

Full details about what's in this release are available in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/trunk/src&range=142910:150285&mode=html). Found a bug? [Report it!](http://new.crbug.com/) On a different channel, but want to join us on the Beta train? The [Chromium wiki](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel) has you covered.
