Tom Hendrikx reports:

> It is possible to crash (SIGSEGV) a NSD child server process by
> sending it a DNS packet from any host on the internet and the per
> zone stats build option is enabled. A crashed child process will
> automatically be restarted by the parent process, but an attacker
> may keep the NSD server occupied restarting child processes by
> sending it a stream of such packets effectively preventing the
> NSD server to serve.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

#### Synopsis

The remote FreeBSD host is missing a security-related update.
#### Description

Tom Hendrikx reports :

It is possible to crash (SIGSEGV) a NSD child server process by sending it a DNS packet from any host on the internet and the per zone stats build option is enabled. A crashed child process will automatically be restarted by the parent process, but an attacker may keep the NSD server occupied restarting child processes by sending it a stream of such packets effectively preventing the NSD server to serve.
#### Solution

Update the affected package.
