{
  "CVE-2012-2979": {
    "Description": "FreeBSD NSD before 3.2.13 allows remote attackers to crash a NSD child server process (SIGSEGV) and cause a denial of service in the NSD server.",
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability exists in the NSD (Name Server Daemon) where a specific type of DNS packet, when sent to a NSD child process with the per-zone stats option enabled, can cause a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of certain DNS packets by the NSD child process when per-zone stats are enabled."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash a NSD child server process which will be restarted automatically, but sending a continuous stream of such packets can cause denial of service by continuously restarting the crashed processes.",
    "Attack vector": "The attack vector is remote, via network. An attacker can send specially crafted DNS packets to the vulnerable NSD server from any host.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker does not require any special capabilities or privileges other than the ability to send network packets to the vulnerable server."
  }
