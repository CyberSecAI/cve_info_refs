Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2404:

**Verification:**

The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 2670-1) explicitly lists CVE-2012-2404 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the WordPress update.  The WordPress news post about version 3.3.2 also mentions "Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in redirects after posting comments in older browsers". This aligns with the nature of the fix detailed in the changeset. Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2012-2404.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the usage of `wp_redirect()` function in `wp-comments-post.php` for redirection after comment submission. This function allowed for arbitrary offsite redirects, which could be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unvalidated Redirects:** The `wp_redirect()` function was used without proper sanitization or validation of the redirect URL, allowing an attacker to craft malicious URLs and redirect users to arbitrary sites. This is a classic open redirect vulnerability.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Context:**  The news post mentions "Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in redirects after posting comments". While not explicitly detailed in the changeset, this implies that the vulnerable redirect was exploitable to inject malicious scripts if the crafted URL was not properly handled by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing:** An attacker could redirect a user to a phishing page, tricking them into entering their credentials or personal information.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to websites hosting malware, leading to infection of the user's device.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:**  In conjunction with XSS vulnerabilities, it could allow execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the target website, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks.
- **Spoofing:** Users might be tricked into thinking they are on the legitimate website, which could harm the website's reputation and brand.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Comment Submission:** An attacker could craft a comment with a specially crafted `redirect` parameter that contains the malicious URL. When the user submits the comment, they would be redirected to the malicious URL after the comment is posted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Submit Comments:** The attacker needs the ability to post a comment on the affected WordPress site. This typically requires no special privileges.
- **Understanding of HTTP Redirection:** The attacker needs to understand how HTTP redirection works and how to craft a malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**

The changeset shows the fix: the insecure `wp_redirect($location)` was replaced with `wp_safe_redirect( $location )`. The `wp_safe_redirect()` function performs security checks on the redirect URL, preventing redirects to arbitrary external sites.

**Summary:**

CVE-2012-2404 in WordPress arises from an open redirect vulnerability in `wp-comments-post.php` where the `wp_redirect` function was used without proper validation of the redirect URL. This could be exploited by attackers via comment submission leading to phishing, malware distribution, and cross-site scripting attacks by redirecting users to malicious sites, potentially compromising user accounts and devices.
