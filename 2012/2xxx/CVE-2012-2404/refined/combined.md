Debian Bug     : 670124

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool.  As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead
of backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2+dfsg-1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# WordPress 3.3.2 (and WordPress 3.4 Beta 3)

---

[WordPress 3.3.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) is available now and is a security update for all previous versions.

Three external libraries included in WordPress received security updates:

* Plupload (version 1.5.4), which WordPress uses for uploading media.
* SWFUpload, which WordPress previously used for uploading media, and may still be in use by plugins.
* SWFObject, which WordPress previously used to embed Flash content, and may still be in use by plugins and themes.

Thanks to [Neal Poole](https://nealpoole.com/blog/) and [Nathan Partlan](http://greywhind.wordpress.com/) for [responsibly disclosing](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security) the bugs in Plupload and SWFUpload, and [Szymon Gruszecki](http://mars.iti.pk.edu.pl/~grucha/) for a separate bug in SWFUpload.

WordPress 3.3.2 also addresses:

* Limited privilege escalation where a site administrator could deactivate network-wide plugins when running a WordPress network under particular circumstances, disclosed by [Jon Cave](http://joncave.co.uk/) of our WordPress core security team, and [Adam Backstrom](http://sixohthree.com/).
* Cross-site scripting vulnerability when making URLs clickable, by Jon Cave.
* Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in redirects after posting comments in older browsers, and when filtering URLs. Thanks to [Mauro Gentile](http://www.sneaked.net/) for responsibly disclosing these issues to the security team.

These issues were fixed by the WordPress core security team. Five other bugs were also fixed in version 3.3.2. Consult the [change log](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.3?rev=20552&stop_rev=20087) for more details.

[Download WordPress 3.3.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) or update now from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

### WordPress 3.4 Beta 3 also available

Our development of WordPress 3.4 development continues. Today we are proud to release Beta 3 for testing. [Nearly 90 changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk?rev=20552&stop_rev=20450) have been made since Beta 2, released 9 days ago. (We are aiming for a beta every week.)

This is still beta software, so **we don’t recommend that you use it on production sites**. But if you’re a plugin developer, a theme developer, or a site administrator, **you should be running this on your test environments** and [reporting any bugs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs) you find. (See the [known issues here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5).) If you’re a WordPress user who wants to open your presents early, take advantage of WordPress’s famous 5-minute install and spin up a secondary test site. [Let us know what you think](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta)!

Version 3.4 Beta 3 includes all of the fixes included in version 3.3.2. [Download WordPress 3.4 Beta 3](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.4-beta3.zip) or use the [WordPress Beta Tester](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) plugin.
