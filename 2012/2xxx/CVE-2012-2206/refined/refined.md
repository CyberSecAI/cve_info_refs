Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-2206

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Insufficient access control in the "Web Gateway" component of IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Authenticated users with limited permissions (e.g., download/upload) can access other users' files and filespaces.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** Users can access files of other users if they know the file's URL and related ID. The system doesn't enforce proper access controls based on the user session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Malicious users can view and download files belonging to other users, leading to potential data breaches and confidentiality violations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** Exploiting the vulnerability involves sending crafted HTTP GET requests to specific URLs.
*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate URLs to bypass access controls and retrieve sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the system, although they don't require administrative privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Target User's Data:** In the second attack scenario, the attacker needs to know the file name and the related ID of the file they want to access from the victim user.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Example 1 (Viewing User Data):** A user ("user2") can access another user's ("user1") transfer metadata by sending a GET request to `/transfer/?start=0&count=10&metadata=fteSamplesUser=user1`. This returns data associated with "user1", which "user2" should not have access to.
*   **Example 2 (Downloading User Files):** A user ("user2") can download files from another user ("user1") if they know the full path, such as `/filespace/user1/414d512057514d542020202020202020eb3bfc4f2030df02/changedthisfilename.txt`.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Version 7.0.4 and all previous versions of WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition.
*   All platforms on which WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition is running.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit was discovered by Nir Valtman, although IBM didn't initially credit him in the CVE publication.

This vulnerability allows a user to bypass access control and directly access files belonging to other users if they know the relevant information.
