      "text": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft .NET Framework handles the loading of DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights."

      "text": "An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate .NET application built with ADO.NET that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file.

    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the .NET Framework incorrectly restricting the path used for loading external DLL files, specifically when using the Entity Framework and ADO.NET.",

      "Insecure loading of external libraries",
      "Insufficient path qualification when loading DLLs"

    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to gain complete control of the system, enabling them to install programs, view, change or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate .NET application built with ADO.NET that is located in the same network directory as a specially crafted DLL file.  When the application attempts to load a required or optional library from a location not properly validated, it can load the crafted DLL and execute the attacker's code.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to open a file from an untrusted location (remote network location), and to place a malicious DLL in the same location.",
     "additional_details": "This vulnerability is related to a class of issues concerning how applications load external libraries (as described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637). This security update addresses a specific instance of this type of vulnerability in the .NET Framework's handling of DLL loading in relation to Entity Framework and ADO.NET."
