    "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "Integer overflow in size calculation within `nedmalloc`'s `calloc` and `malloc` implementations. Specifically, the multiplication of the number of elements and the size of each element (`no * size` in `calloc`, and the addition of size and alignment in `malloc`) could result in a wrapped-around value, leading to allocation of a smaller buffer than intended.",

        "impact": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. When an attacker controls the size arguments passed to `malloc` or `calloc`, the resulting integer overflow will cause the functions to allocate smaller buffers than expected. Subsequently, if the application copies data into this undersized buffer, it results in a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",

        }
    ],
    "details": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient checks for integer overflows when calculating the allocation size in `nedmalloc`'s `malloc` and `calloc` functions. When an attacker supplies a large size that causes the calculation to wrap around to a small integer, a smaller-than-expected buffer is allocated. This can then be overflowed by writing a larger amount of data. The provided patches add checks that prevent such integer overflows by validating that the results of size calculations are still within expected bounds, preventing the wrapped-around values from being used for allocation size."
