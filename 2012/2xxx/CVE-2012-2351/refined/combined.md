Debian Security Advisory DSA-2467-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : mahara
Vulnerability  : insecure defaults
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no

It was discovered that Mahara, the portfolio, weblog, and resume builder,
had an insecure default with regards to SAML-based authentication used
with more than one SAML identity provider. Someone with control over one
IdP could impersonate users from other IdP's.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

BTW Piers, we use "fix committed" only when the fix has been merged onto the final branch. While it's in review, we use "in progress".

Piers: would you be able to quickly test the 1.3 and 1.4 cherry-picks I just pushed to gerrit?

(I've tested that the setting is turned on by default, but I don't feel confident enough to test the other changes in that patch.)

Richard: given I was the one to do the cherry-pick can you quickly double-check to make sure everything looks fine and give your +2?

BTW Piers, we use "fix committed" only when the fix has been merged onto the final branch. While it's in review, we use "in progress".

Piers: would you be able to quickly test the 1.3 and 1.4 cherry-picks I just pushed to gerrit?

(I've tested that the setting is turned on by default, but I don't feel confident enough to test the other changes in that patch.)

Richard: given I was the one to do the cherry-pick can you quickly double-check to make sure everything looks fine and give your +2?

Hi,
please assign a CVE ID for this issue in Mahara, which was released as

| It was discovered that Mahara, the portfolio, weblog, and resume builder,
| had an insecure default with regards to SAML-based authentication used
| with more than one SAML identity provider. Someone with control over one
| IdP could impersonate users from other IdP's.
