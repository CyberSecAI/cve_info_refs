Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-2552:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from improper validation of a request parameter by SQL Server Report Manager. Specifically, the Report Manager on the SQL Server site doesn't properly sanitize input parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw. This means that malicious script is injected into a user's browser through a crafted request, and the server reflects it back in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate their privileges within the context of the targeted user on the SSRS site.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the SSRS site, impersonating the targeted user.
*   **Content Spoofing:** Attackers could inject scripts to alter or spoof website content.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Malicious scripts can be used to steal sensitive information available to the user within the application.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker can perform actions that the user can perform on the site, on behalf of the targeted user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Link:** An attacker sends a specially crafted link to a user. If the user clicks the link, the malicious script is executed.
*   **Compromised Website:** Attackers can host a website containing a webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability, or inject the exploit code into compromised websites.
*   **User-Provided Content:** Websites that accept or host user-provided content (such as advertisements, comments, or forum posts) could be used to deliver the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need to authenticate to the system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince users to click a malicious link or visit a website containing the exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects systems running SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) across multiple versions including SQL Server 2000, 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, and 2012.
*   Microsoft recommends applying the security update as soon as possible.
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how SQL Server Report Manager handles input parameters, specifically by encoding them correctly.
*   Internet Explorer's XSS filter (versions 8, 9, and 10) can prevent this attack when browsing in the Internet Zone (but not necessarily the Intranet zone).

This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject a client-side script into the user's instance of Internet Explorer, potentially enabling them to gain unauthorized access or control of the user's session and data on the vulnerable system.
