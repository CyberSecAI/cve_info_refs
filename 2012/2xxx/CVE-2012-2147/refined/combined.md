The packaging of munin node determines whether it will install
symlinks for enabling plugins. The packaging of munin master
determines whether a configuration for your httpd is installed and
activated.

On Debian, symlinks to enable plugins are installed by default, and an
apache2 configuration is automatically activated. So, on Debian, if
your httpd is publicly-accessible, the munin pages and CGI will be
publicly-accessible.

Please use CVE-2012-2147 for this issue (specifying the size = lots of

I believe I fixed the bug in r4825, since :
- url with query string aren't stored permanently anymore.
- /tmp isn't used anymore per default (to fix #668536)

Could you confirm that ?

OTOH, the issue about very big imgs that gets the cgi into swapping
isn't the same bug to be.

As Helmut noticed, there is already a size cap in rrd, so do I still
need implement one in munin ? If yes, would you mind to file another
bugreport (for RAM exhaustion) ?

Thx !

Hi Kurt,

Please always CC the bug report when adding detail to it. Doing it now
for you.

The basic requirement is that a plugin called vmstat is configured for
the node localhost.localdomain. I just picked it as an example, cause it
is present on my system. In practise any plugin for any host will do.

The filling of the disk works by choosing a unique query string for each
request, because munin "caches" all theses images without ever deleting
them and includes the query string in the filename. So you are right,
that we get a base amplification of 20k/request.

In addition munin parses parts of the query string. You are allowed to
modify the size of the image. By choosing a path
"....png?size_x=20000&size_y=20000&uniquestuff" you can do the same
attack while simultaneously using a large image size. The raw image
would be 381M (assuming 8bits/pixel) in this case. A png version will
likely be smaller, say 4M? So now you have an amplification of
4M/request. Note that this query can get a node into swapping, because
rrdtool needs to create the whole image in main memory.

Hope this helps

Helmut

though on Debian, apache is only accessable on localhost per default.

If anyone can comment on this (default/not), and if you install a
plugin does it expose it publicly or does the administrator have to
enable remote access?
