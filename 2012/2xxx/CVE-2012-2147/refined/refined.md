Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Munin's parsing of query strings within image requests, specifically the `size_x` and `size_y` parameters. By manipulating these parameters, an attacker can force the server to generate very large images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Image Size:** Munin does not properly limit the size of images it generates based on user-supplied `size_x` and `size_y` parameters in the query string.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The vulnerability can be used to cause excessive resource consumption on the server. When a request with large `size_x` and `size_y` parameters is made, `rrdtool` (the tool used by munin to generate the graphs) attempts to create the entire image in memory, leading to RAM exhaustion and potentially causing the server to swap.
*   **Amplification Attack**: The generated images, especially PNG images are larger than the request itself, allowing for an amplification attack. A small request can trigger the server to allocate significant resources.
*   **Temporary file storage:** Munin was storing rendered images in `/tmp` with filenames derived from the query string, leading to excessive storage consumption. This aspect was later fixed as a separate issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly send requests with large image dimensions, causing the server to exhaust its memory and potentially crash or become unresponsive.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Even if the server doesn't crash, the excessive memory usage can cause severe performance degradation, impacting the availability of other services running on the same machine.
*   **Disk Space Exhaustion:** While this is a separate issue, the temporary storage of these large images without proper cleanup can also lead to disk space exhaustion in `/tmp`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP GET requests to Munin's CGI script with manipulated `size_x` and `size_y` parameters within the query string.
*   **Public Accessibility (Potentially):** If Munin's HTTP interface is publicly accessible, any remote user can exploit this vulnerability. By default on Debian, the apache configuration is only accessible via localhost, but this can be changed by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Munin server.
*   No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker can be a remote user if the munin interface is exposed to the internet, or a local user if it's only available via localhost.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in munin revision 4825, which prevents storing of urls with query strings and doesn't use /tmp by default for temp files, though the main issue about large images causing RAM exhaustion wasn't directly addressed.
*   The content mentions a size cap in `rrdtool`, but it was not sufficient to fully mitigate the problem in the context of Munin's usage.
*   There were initial discussions about whether filling `/tmp` constitutes a security vulnerability, but the ability to cause resource exhaustion (RAM) by rendering large images was determined to be a denial-of-service vulnerability.
