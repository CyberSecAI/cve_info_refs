Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2296:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Drupal module "Janrain Engage" was found to be persisting a login token in plain text.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive data protection vulnerability, specifically the storage of login tokens in plaintext.

**Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could gain access to sensitive user login tokens, potentially allowing them to impersonate users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.

**Attack vectors:**  An attacker who gains access to the system where the login tokens are stored in plaintext (e.g., through a compromised server or database) can obtain these tokens.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would require access to the storage location of the plaintext login tokens. This could involve gaining unauthorized access to the server, database, or any other location where the tokens are persisted.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2012-2296 as part of a batch of CVE assignments for Drupal contributed module issues.
- The discussion in the provided email indicates that the decision to assign a CVE was based on the fact that the module was persisting sensitive information (login tokens) in plaintext, similar to how storing passwords in plaintext would be considered a serious security flaw.
