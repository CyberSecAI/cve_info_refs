  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The CKEditor and FCKeditor modules for Drupal are vulnerable to multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of users viewing the affected Drupal site. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through user-supplied input which is not properly sanitized when displayed by the CKEditor or FCKeditor modules.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the fields handled by the CKEditor or FCKeditor modules. This could potentially be through various means, including user input fields that are not sanitized or direct manipulation of database content if the attacker has sufficient access privileges."
