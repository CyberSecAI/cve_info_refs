[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0132)

## Topic

An updated autofs package that fixes one security issue, several bugs, and
adds one enhancement is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The autofs utility controls the operation of the automount daemon. The
automount daemon automatically mounts and unmounts file systems.

A bug fix included in RHBA-2012:0264 introduced a denial of service flaw in
autofs. When using autofs with LDAP, a local user could use this flaw to
crash autofs, preventing future mount requests from being processed until
the autofs service was restarted. Note: This flaw did not impact existing
mounts (except for preventing mount expiration). (CVE-2012-2697)

Red Hat would like to thank Ray Rocker for reporting this issue.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The autofs init script sometimes timed out waiting for the automount

daemon to exit and returned a shutdown failure if the daemon failed to exit
in time. To resolve this problem, the amount of time that the init script
waits for the daemon has been increased to allow for cases where servers
are slow to respond or there are many active mounts. (BZ#585058)

* Due to an omission when backporting a change, autofs attempted to

download the entire LDAP map at startup. This mistake has now been
corrected. (BZ#767428)

* A function to check the validity of a mount location was meant to check

only for a small subset of map location errors. A recent modification in
error reporting inverted a logic test in this validating function.
Consequently, the scope of the test was widened, which caused the automount
daemon to report false positive failures. With this update, the faulty
logic test has been corrected and false positive failures no longer occur.
(BZ#798448)

* When there were many attempts to access invalid or non-existent keys, the

automount daemon used excessive CPU resources. As a consequence, systems
sometimes became unresponsive. The code has been improved so that automount
checks for invalid keys earlier in the process which has eliminated a
significant amount of the processing overhead. (BZ#847101)

* The auto.master(5) man page did not document the "-t, --timeout" option

in the FORMAT options section. This update adds this information to the man
page. (BZ#859890)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* Previously, it was not possible to configure separate timeout values for

individual direct map entries in the autofs master map. This update adds
this functionality. (BZ#690404)

All users of autofs are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=831772#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-13 18:25:01 UTC  ``` Due to a problem with the patch used to correct a problem with LDAP servers not correctly returning an opaque cookie to check for additional results when getting paged results from a server on 64-bit PowerPC and IBM System z platforms (RHBA-2012:0264), it was possible for a user to cause a denial of service of the autofs service.  While this may not impact mounts that have already been mounted (other than preventing mount expiration), it will prevent any future mount requests from being processed until autofs is restarted.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=831772#c3)  Murray McAllister    2012-11-22 03:25:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Ray Rocker for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=831772#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-08 05:14:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:0132 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0132.html>   ``` |  |

## Topic

An updated autofs package that fixes several bugs and adds one enhancement is
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

## Description

The autofs utility controls the operation of the automount daemon. The automount
daemon automatically mounts and unmounts file systems.

This update fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, autofs submounts incorrectly handled shutdown synchronization and

lock restrictions. As a consequence, automount could be unresponsive when
submounts expired. With this update, the submount shuts down only after the
states ST\_SHUTDOWN, ST\_SHUTDOWN\_PENDING, and ST\_SHUTDOWN\_FORCE, or when the
state changes to ST\_READY. (BZ#655685)

* Previously, automount did not correctly parse unmatched brackets in

map entry server names. As a consequence, the sanity check for host
names in these map entries could fail. Now, unmatched brackets in server
names result in a syntax error being reported and the check no longer
fails. (BZ#692814)

* Previously, the automount logged confusing error messages when syntax errors

occurred in map entry locations. This update modifies these messages and
displays more informative messages were possible. (BZ#700142)

* Previously, LDAP servers did not correctly return an opaque cookie to check

for additional results when getting paged results from the server on 64-bit
PowerPC and IBM System z platforms due to slightly different criteria for
deciding if there are more results. As a consequence, the autofs internal
functions did not detect when paged result sets were not supported. This update
modifies the underlying source code so that autofs now correctly detects whether
the paged results are updated. (BZ#700896)

* Previously, an incorrect check for the presence of additional addresses for a

host led to the IP address being used for mounting instead of the host name. As
a consequence the IP address was displayed instead of the host name when listing
system mounts, even when the host had only a single address. This update
modifies the check so that the IP address is used only if a host has multiple IP
addresses. (BZ#725536)

* Previously, incorrect identification of the map entry source caused a failure

during the key lookup. As a consequence, map lookups for an automount, where a a
key was present in a file map and the same key was also found in an included
map, failed if the file map entry was removed and a lookup was performed before
a re-load is issued. This update modifies the key lookup code and the lookup
works now as expected. (BZ#731514, BZ#732333)

* Previously, automount could become unresponsive when reloading a master map

that included a combination of direct and indirect maps due to incorrect lock
ordering. This update corrects the logic used to determine if the lookup needs
to continue into included maps. (BZ#732332)

* Previously, map entries were always mounted using proximity and response time

instead of bind mounting when adding a random selection of a host if the mount
was local. This update modifies this behavior and also adds the "nobind" option
to allow the previous behavior to be forced if needed. (BZ#734675)

* Previously, the map key lookup mechanism did not find keys in an included

multi-mount map entry. This update modifies the lookup mechanism so that keys in
multi-mount map entries are now found correctly. (BZ#747020)

* Previously, the stack allocation function of the temporary work space was used

within a loop in the function lookup\_ghost(). As a consequence, a stack overflow
could occur and automount then failed with a segmentation fault. This update
corrects the allocation usage and the stack overflows no longer occurs.
(BZ#759221)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* With this update,the "--dumpmaps" option to dump maps has been added to dump

in autofs. (BZ#732334)

All users of autofs are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which fixes
these bugs and adds this enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the Red
Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=831772#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-13 18:25:01 UTC  ``` Due to a problem with the patch used to correct a problem with LDAP servers not correctly returning an opaque cookie to check for additional results when getting paged results from a server on 64-bit PowerPC and IBM System z platforms (RHBA-2012:0264), it was possible for a user to cause a denial of service of the autofs service.  While this may not impact mounts that have already been mounted (other than preventing mount expiration), it will prevent any future mount requests from being processed until autofs is restarted.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=831772#c3)  Murray McAllister    2012-11-22 03:25:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Ray Rocker for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=831772#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-08 05:14:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:0132 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0132.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
