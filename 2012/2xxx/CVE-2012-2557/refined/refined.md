Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in Internet Explorer. It occurs when the browser attempts to access an object in memory that has already been deleted. Specifically related to the `cloneNode` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free condition. This occurs when a program continues to use a pointer after the memory it points to has been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user. This could lead to complete system compromise if the user has administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker would need to convince the user to visit this website.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers might also inject malicious code into legitimate websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Email/Instant Messenger:** Attackers could trick users into clicking malicious links in emails or instant messages or opening malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need physical access to the victim's machine.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious attachment.
- **Crafted Webpage:** The attacker needs to create a webpage with code that exploits the use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer's `cloneNode` function.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS12-063.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on various Windows operating systems, with varying severity levels depending on the operating system and IE version.
- The provided document specifies that "Severity ratings do not apply to this update for the specified software because the known attack vectors for the vulnerability discussed in this bulletin are blocked in a default configuration. However, as a defense-in-depth measure, Microsoft recommends that customers of this software apply this security update."

The provided information offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, particularly concerning the specific code that's vulnerable (`cloneNode`), attack vectors, and mitigation strategies.
