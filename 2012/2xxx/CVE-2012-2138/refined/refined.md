Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient validity checks on the source and destination paths used in the `CopyOperation` of the Apache Sling Servlets Post module. Specifically, it was possible to provide paths to the copy operation that would lead to unexpected or potentially harmful behavior. This issue was discovered as a result of a duplicate issue reported, SLING-2211, which highlighted a potential infinite loop in the copy operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper validation for the "copyFrom" paths, potentially allowing for illogical or dangerous copy operations (e.g., copying a directory to itself or into a child directory, resulting in an infinite loop).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential Infinite Loop:** The issue is linked to SLING-2211 which resulted in a potential infinite loop in the copy operation, possibly leading to resource exhaustion or service disruption.
- **Unintended Copy Behavior:** The lack of checks could allow for unexpected or incorrect copying of resources, potentially affecting data integrity or application state.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector would be through HTTP POST requests to the Sling POST servlet, specifically targeting the `:copy` operation.
- An attacker would need to manipulate the `copyFrom` parameter in the POST request to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Sling server.
- They would need to know the structure of the JCR repository to be able to craft paths that exploit the lack of validation.
- It is likely that some level of access to the Sling server is required, though the specific level is not specified in the provided content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in Servlets Post version 2.1.2.
- The issue was categorized as a "Bug" with a "Minor" priority, suggesting that while the problem existed, it was not considered a critical security issue.
- The vulnerability was resolved relatively quickly after being reported, with the fix being implemented on the same day as the initial issue creation.
