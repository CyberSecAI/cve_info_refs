Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-2102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how MySQL processes `HANDLER READ NEXT` statements after a record has been deleted. Specifically, after deleting a record using the `HANDLER` API and then attempting to read the subsequent record using `HANDLER READ NEXT`, a crash can be triggered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of cursor state in the `HANDLER` API after a delete operation, leading to a denial-of-service condition due to an assertion failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An authenticated remote MySQL user can cause the `mysqld` daemon to abort/crash, effectively disrupting database service availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote, authenticated access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to send SQL queries to the MySQL server.
- The vulnerability is triggered through the execution of specific SQL statements using the `HANDLER` API (`HANDLER ... READ NEXT` after a `DELETE` operation)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have valid credentials to connect to the MySQL server.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute SQL commands, including `HANDLER` statements, on a database where records can be deleted.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in MySQL versions 5.5.21 and earlier, and 5.1.61 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in MySQL versions 5.5.22 and 5.1.62.
- Oracle provided a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script (`mysql-test/suite/innodb/t/innodb_bug13510739.test`) along with the fixes in the new versions, which demonstrates the vulnerability by triggering the crash.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability and its fix in `mysql 5.1.62` and `mysql 5.5.22`, stating that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not affected.
