How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#### **PoC provided by :**

Oracle

#### **Reference(s) :**

 [MySQL 5.5.22 release note](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/news-5-5-22.html)

 [MySQL 5.1.62 release note](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-62.html)

#### **Affected version(s) :**

MySQL Server 5.5.21 and previous versions

MySQL Server 5.1.61 and previous versions

#### **Tested on Centos 5** with :

MySQL 5.5.21

#### **Description :**

Oracle has release, the 21 March, two new versions of MySQL, version 5.5.22 and 5.1.62. These versions have fix two bugs [#13510739](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=13510739) and [#63775](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=63775) how are considered as security fixes. But no impact details of these bugs are provided and the bugs report are closed.

Unfortunately for Oracle the two new versions were shipped with a development script “*mysql-test/suite/innodb/t/innodb\_bug13510739.test*” in order to test the fix of the vulnerabilities, a PoC provided by Oracle. The bugs cause a denial of service of MySQL “*ON HANDLER READ NEXT AFTER DELETE RECORD*“. All the details are available in the script or on the upper Pastebin link.

#### **Commands :**

```
mysql -u root -p database < innodb_bug13510739.test
```

   That MySQL server has crashing bugs when garbage is fed down the connection has been well known inside the MySQL developer community and inside the network security community for many years. It’s a trivial exercise to find them: just run a standard jabber test against MySQL, and it’s almost as trivial to generate repeatable generator scripts.

   There is very little of useful knowledge here.

   Weaponized exploit scripts against MySQL are widely available inside the various penetration and security communities, including other bugs than the ones fixed here. No new risks have been introduced by this “leak”, and more security and more understanding of security is now available.

      Hi Mark,

      The DoS in it self is not the subject. The subject of this demonstration is that Oracle pretend to secure MySQL by “obscurity”, and that “obscurity” in “open source” world is not the best approach.

   Thank you for sharing this Poc! Is there a fix available?
