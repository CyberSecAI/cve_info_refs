Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2740:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `sortby` parameter in phpList version 2.10.17 is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  Improper input sanitization of the `sortby` parameter leads to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code. This could lead to:
    *   Exposure of sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Manipulation or deletion of data.
    *   Potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application or server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL. Specifically, by manipulating the `sortby` parameter in a GET request to the vulnerable phpList application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpList instance. No special privileges are explicitly mentioned to be needed, suggesting it could be performed remotely by anyone.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided content also discusses a separate XSS vulnerability (CVE-2012-2741) in the `num` parameter, but this is not related to CVE-2012-2740.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in phpList version 2.10.18
