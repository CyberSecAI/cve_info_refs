- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization of the "priority" field when creating and adding an item in the "todo list".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration (e.g., usernames, passwords, database names), and possibly reading system files if the MySQL user has the required permissions.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited via a POST request to `/engine.php` with the `action=addTodo` parameter and a malicious SQL payload in the `priority` parameter. The `text` parameter is used to display the results of the SQL query.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is needed.
