Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2108:

**Root Cause:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `lpc_import` utility of Csound.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `lpc_import` utility is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. This occurs when processing a specially crafted CSV file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could cause the application (Csound) to crash due to the buffer overflow.
- This could potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses on the stack, although the provided content does not explicitly state this.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted CSV file using the `lpc_import` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious CSV file to the vulnerable `lpc_import` utility. This could be achieved through user interaction (e.g., tricking a user into opening the malicious file) or potentially by feeding it to an application utilizing Csound.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Csound version 5.17 and later.
-  The initial patch was identified as commit `61d1df45ca9a52bab62892a3c3a13c41e6384505`
