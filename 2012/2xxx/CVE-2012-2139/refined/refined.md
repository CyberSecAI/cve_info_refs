Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2139:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a file system traversal issue within the `file_delivery` method of the `rubygem-mail` library. Specifically, the library was not sanitizing the destination file path when writing out emails, allowing an attacker to specify a path outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **File System Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to traverse the file system using specially crafted paths in the email destination, allowing writes to arbitrary locations. This was due to the use of `File.join` with unsanitized input in the `file_delivery` method when creating the output file path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could write arbitrary content to any location on the file system that the Ruby process has write permissions. This could be used to overwrite system files, inject malicious code, or cause denial of service, among other things.
 
**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `file_delivery` method is used in `rubygem-mail`. This usually occurs when the application using the `mail` gem attempts to deliver email via the file system.
- An attacker crafts a malicious email with a `to` field containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../../../tmp/pwn`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to Send Malicious Emails:** The attacker needs to be able to send or have the system process emails where the destination is controlled by the attacker or can be modified. This could occur via a vulnerability in the application's email handling.
- **Write Access:** The Ruby process executing the code must have write permissions to the target location on the file system.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved using `File.basename` on the destination path before creating the output file, stripping directory traversal sequences.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `rubygem-mail` version 2.4.4.
- The vulnerability is separate from the command execution issue (CVE-2012-2140).
