Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2172:

**CVE-2012-2172 Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The `updateRegn` parameter in the `SoftwareRegistration.do` script is not properly sanitized before being displayed to the user.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `updateRegn` parameter.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session in the context of the affected site. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Phishing attacks by redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Defacement of the web page.
    *   Theft of sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through a crafted URL, specifically, the `updateRegn` parameter in the `SoftwareRegistration.do` script. The attacker would need to get the user to visit this malicious URL.
    *   The example URL given is: `http://10.1.0.3:9000/SoftwareRegistration.do?updateRegn=">`. This demonstrates an injection attempt where `">` will be inserted to break out of HTML tags and allow malicious HTML code to be run.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious script code in the `updateRegn` parameter.
    *   The attacker needs to entice a user to visit the malicious URL, typically through phishing, social engineering or by including the crafted URL in another website.
    *   The user must be authenticated with the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also describes CVE-2012-2171, which is an SQL Injection vulnerability in the same product.
*   The vendor, IBM, was responsive in addressing the issue, releasing a fix approximately three months after the initial report.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic of Zero Science.
