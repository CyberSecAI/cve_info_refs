# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

Subject: libjpeg-turbo: Heap-based buffer overflow when decompressing corrupt
 JPEG images

Hi all,

We were made aware of a flaw in libjpeg-turbo by Chris Evans of Google
security team. Details as follows:

A Heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libjpeg-turbo
decompressed certain corrupt JPEG images in which the component count
was erroneously set to a large value. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted JPEG image that, when opened, could cause an
application using libpng to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

References:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=826849>
<http://libjpeg-turbo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libjpeg-turbo?view=revision&revision=830>

This issue has been assigned CVE-2012-2806.

Upstream release of libjpeg-turbo-1.2.1 resolves this issue.

In case it's not clear to others, STR is: save this file to disk, give it a .jpg file extension, and open it in Firefox.

This is reproducible in libjpeg-turbo at the low level, and it seems to be specific to -turbo (libjpeg just reports "unsupported data precision 128" and dies gracefully.)

There are a bunch of Chris Evans'es in bugzilla. I think the one we want is scarybeasts, based on the fact that [1] links to [2].
Can anyone confirm that this is the person we want? If not does anyone mind if we cc this potentially-random-but-probably-not person to this bug?

[Second repro-file](attachment.cgi?id=629187) (obsolete)

Adding second repro-file. This repro-file doesn't cause null-exec instead it is heap-buffer-overflow - Write.
I think that this crash is because of the same bug because the two frames get\_sos and consume\_markers are the same I catched previously from Chrome with the first repro-file

Note: pending resolution of this, I intend to release the current 1.2.x branch as 1.2.1.
Would be nice to get some confirmation of the fix from Chrome as well. They haven't added me to the bug on their end, so I have no idea what the status is.

You should be using branches/1.2.x, not trunk, since trunk contains evolving (not necessarily well-tested) code.

This looks pretty safe to take on branches to me. That is, after looking at the diff, I think my concerns in [bug 759891 comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=759891#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update libjpeg-turbo to 1.2.x branch r831 (or later)") were unfounded.

[Approval Request Comment]
Security fix. No string changes.
I don't know what the process is for landing changes on the release channel, and I'm not familiar with the bar we set for those changes. But this looks like a relatively easily exploitable vulnerability to me, so I'd like us to consider it for the release channel.

The specifics of this bug are that jdmarker.c:326 was attempting to zero out the current component info pointers:
for (i = 0; i < cinfo->num\_components; i++)
cinfo->cur\_comp\_info[i] = NULL;
Due to a corrupt header in the JPEG file, num\_components was being set to a fairly ridiculous value (73, in the case of one of the examples.) Unfortunately, the section of code that checks for said ridiculous value is executed after the code in jdmarker.c, so what was happening was that memory was being zeroed out to the end of the jpeg\_decompress\_struct and beyond. It didn't cause an access violation, perhaps because there was another structure allocated immediately following on the heap. However, all of the decompression subobject pointers in jpeg\_decompress\_struct were now set to NULL.
Following the above code is a loop:
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
INPUT\_BYTE(cinfo, cc, return FALSE);
INPUT\_BYTE(cinfo, c, return FALSE);
for (ci = 0, compptr = cinfo->comp\_info; ci < cinfo->num\_components;
ci++, compptr++) {
if (cc == compptr->component\_id && !cinfo->cur\_comp\_info[ci])
goto id\_found;
}
ERREXIT1(cinfo, JERR\_BAD\_COMPONENT\_ID, cc);
id\_found:
cinfo->cur\_comp\_info[i] = compptr;
compptr->dc\_tbl\_no = (c >> 4) & 15;
compptr->ac\_tbl\_no = (c ) & 15;
TRACEMS3(cinfo, 1, JTRC\_SOS\_COMPONENT, cc,
compptr->dc\_tbl\_no, compptr->ac\_tbl\_no);
}
n is guaranteed to be < MAX\_COMP\_SCANS, due to a check earlier in the function. Thus, although the above loop will erroneously try to read past the cur\_comp\_info pointers and past the end of the structure, it will not write past the boundaries of the cur\_comp\_info pointers, and thus the NULL subobject pointers will still be NULL.
To summarize, in my opinion, the bug will not ever cause a non-NULL pointer to be executed.

Dan wontfix'd this for 13, but we'll track nonetheless in case we take ride-alongs with a possible 13.0.1. Approving for Aurora 15, Beta 14 and the ESR, however.

That's what it looked like to me, too. Although in at least one case I've seen the ability to write a single null on a heap structure pointer led to code execution when the heap buffer was freed.

Well, [comment 14](/show_bug.cgi?id=759802#c14 "VERIFIED FIXED - Null-pointer execution/null out of bounds write at libjpeg/jdmarker.c") demonstrates that they can write 0 onto the heap, right? Heap overflow is potentially critical (although it's surely difficult to exploit!).

Just the r830 --> r831 change.
Landed on beta for FF14: <https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/d835833d44a0>
Unfortunately ESR is still running libjpeg-turbo v1.1.0 (r469), and this patch does not apply cleanly.
I \*think\* I see how to modify the patch, but it's not clear to me that v1.1.0 doesn't have other unfixed security vulnerabilities.

For ESR, I think we'd need
r740: <http://libjpeg-turbo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libjpeg-turbo/trunk/jdmarker.c?view=patch&r1=740&r2=739&pathrev=740>

r831: (patch in this bug)
But it would be good to know if there are other known security vulnerabilities in 1.1.0; otherwise we're not accomplishing much by taking this one change.

Hi, folks. Please note that this security vulnerability did not exist in 1.1.0. It was introduced by r740 in 1.2.0. Thus, all you're doing above is introducing the vulnerability into a code base that was already secure, then you're introducing a new patch to fix the vulnerability that you just introduced. In other words, you're swallowing the spider to catch the fly, but I don't know why you swallowed the fly.
The only issue I see in the changelog that you might want to look at for patching 1.1.0 is this one:
<http://crbug.com/72399>
I'm not sure if it's a security vulnerability or not. It never created a segfault or any visible run-time issue. It was mainly just that it made valgrind unhappy.
You might want to scan the changelog yourself and double-check to see if any other post-1.1.0 changes stand out as possible security vulnerabilities, but I just scanned it myself and didn't notice anything.

a little of both. /Some/ crashes where null is executed can be proved to always be null, and those are not sec-critical. Many crashes where null is executed is because memory is messed up, and maybe in other conditions it could be an exploitable non-null. So "Any" is incorrect, but it's common.
In other stacks "random" addresses on the stack are due to JS JITted code, it's not really random so we have to distinguish those cases (but, crashing JITted code is often bad anyway). That's not the case here.
> moderate?
No, if this is exploitable it's sec-critical, if it's not then it's a DoS. We don't use a "Schrodinger's Cat Moderate" indeterminate state.

It offers no benefit to Firefox AFAIK. r740 was introduced in response to a request from the SumatraPDF developers, because apparently PDF files generated by a certain popular content creation application had incorrectly-encoded CMYK JPEG files embedded in them. Adobe Acrobat rendered the PDF's correctly, so it was desirable for SumatraPDF to also render the PDF's correctly so users would not accuse them of incompatibility. I introduced the "fix" in libjpeg-turbo (which is really less of a fix and more of a relaxing of the rules) in order to lend my support to another open source project, but the "fix" created the regression that led to this bug report.

FF14/FF15 are both on libjpeg 1.2.x branch, and were vulnerable to this exploit. ESR is on the 1.1.x branch and is not vulnerable.

According to Atte, Chris Evans commented in the Chrome bug "You could corrupt any heap object with NULLs, by arranging for a heap object of your choice to appear after the overflowed jpeg\_decompress\_struct. There's a huge number of classes to choose from and I'm sure one of them does not react well to have its state corrupted with NULLs." -- True enough. Wouldn't be easy, but we've seen it done when the motivation is high enough.

Does anyone know if Chrome has shipped this fix yet or do we need to embargo disclosure until a later date (when they do)?

The Chrome issue is marked as fixed. The issue was catched at dev-channel and never reached stable on Chrome.

See [comment 50](/show_bug.cgi?id=759802#c50 "VERIFIED FIXED - Null-pointer execution/null out of bounds write at libjpeg/jdmarker.c"), this was caught (thanks to you!) in Firefox never reached our "stable", either, although the bug did make it to the Beta channel.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

# libjpeg-turbo: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **201209-13**

A vulnerability in libjpeg-turbo could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libjpeg-turbo** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.1** |

### Background

libjpeg-turbo accelerates JPEG compression and decompression.

### Description

A vulnerability in the get\_sos() function in jdmarker.c could cause a
heap-based buffer overflow.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JPEG
file in an application linked against libjpeg-turbo, possibly resulting
in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the
user running the application, or Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libjpeg-turbo users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libjpeg-turbo-1.2.1"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=826849#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-05-31 06:47:15 UTC  ``` A Heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libjpeg-turbo decompressed certain corrupt JPEG images in which the component count was erroneously set to a large value. An attacker could create a specially-crafted JPEG image that, when opened, could cause an application using libpng to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.   Patch: <http://libjpeg-turbo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libjpeg-turbo?view=revision&revision=830>  References: <http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=130240> <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=759802>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=826849#c3)  Huzaifa S.

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
