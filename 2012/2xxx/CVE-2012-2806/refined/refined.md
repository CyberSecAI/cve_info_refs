Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2806:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `get_sos()` function within the `jdmarker.c` file of the `libjpeg-turbo` library.
- This occurs when decompressing specially crafted, corrupt JPEG images where the component count is set to a large, erroneous value. This large value leads to an out-of-bounds write when the code iterates to clear the current component info pointers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** Writing past the allocated buffer on the heap due to an incorrect component count, leading to potential memory corruption.
- **Lack of proper input validation:** The component count from the JPEG header is not properly validated before being used in the loop that zeroes out memory. Specifically, the check for the "ridiculous value" occurs *after* the vulnerable zeroing loop, which enables the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash/Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption can cause the application using `libjpeg-turbo` to crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** In some cases, by carefully crafting a JPEG image, an attacker could potentially overwrite other heap objects, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application. Specifically, the nulling out of pointers within the `jpeg_decompress_struct` can be used to achieve code execution during subsequent operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted JPEG images:** An attacker needs to create a malformed JPEG file with an abnormally large component count.
- **User interaction:** A user has to open or process the malicious JPEG file using an application that uses the vulnerable `libjpeg-turbo` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted JPEG file to the victim.
- They don't need any specific position on the target system; the vulnerability is triggered by simply processing a malicious file.
- They need an understanding of the JPEG format and how to manipulate the header to cause the vulnerability.
- They need some knowledge of heap memory management to craft the exploit that would allow for arbitrary code execution

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in libjpeg-turbo version 1.2.0 by revision r740. Version 1.1.0 was not affected.
- The fix was implemented in version 1.2.1.
- The vulnerability was reported to affect applications such as Firefox and Google Chrome, which used libjpeg-turbo.
- While a null-pointer dereference is a symptom of the vulnerability, the primary issue is the out-of-bounds write leading to memory corruption, making it more than just a null-pointer dereference issue.
- Chrome was affected in the dev-channel but not the stable channel.
- A patch was made available that included revisions r830 and r831.
