Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2567:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the exposure of user data on an insecure FTP server account due to a non-default configuration option within the MobileTrack application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** User data is stored on Xelex's FTP server when the system administrator uses the FTP option instead of HTTPS.
*   **Insecure Credentials:** The system uses the same username and password for all MobileTrack users on the FTP server.
*   **Hard-coded Credentials:**  Test credentials are hardcoded into the application (although the vendor claims they are not actively used).
*   **Unencrypted Data Transfer:** Data is transferred unencrypted over FTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to user data stored on the FTP server. Although the data is automatically removed after upload, there is a small window of opportunity for data theft.
*   **Compromised User Accounts**: If the hardcoded credentials were used, an attacker could have used them to gain access to the FTP server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker would need to be on the network where the FTP server is accessible, and have the credentials.
*   **Configuration flaw:** The vulnerability relies on the MobileTrack system administrator to choose the insecure FTP option rather than HTTPS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know or guess the FTP server address.
*   The attacker would need to know or guess the hardcoded FTP username and password, or that the system is using a default username/password for all users.
*   The attacker needs to monitor the FTP server for newly uploaded files within the small window of opportunity before deletion

**Additional Details (beyond CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is associated with an insecure non-default configuration (FTP instead of HTTPS) for MobileTrack.
*   The data on the FTP server is automatically removed after upload, limiting the window of opportunity for attackers.
*   The vendor has removed the FTP feature in version 2.4.1 and switched to server-based command processing to resolve the issues, and removed hardcoded test credentials.
*   The vulnerability is referenced alongside CVE-2012-2562, another vulnerability in MobileTrack related to unauthenticated SMS commands.
*  The vulnerability was reported by Mobile Defense's Threat Research Team.
