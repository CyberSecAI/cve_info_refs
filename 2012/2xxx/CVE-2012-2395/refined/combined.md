Subject: CVE request: cobbler command injection

It was reported that it was possible to perform command injection
through the cobbler xmlrpc api[0][1]. This issue was fixed in the git
commit found at [2].
Can a CVE be assigned to this issue?

## Description

[![@jdstrand](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1663079?u=50d542bf93286e051a314464cb3518b2d51b78c4&v=4&size=48)](/jdstrand)[jdstrand](https://github.com/jdstrand)opened [on Apr 20, 2012](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/141#issue-4211436)

This is forwarded from <https://launchpad.net/bugs/978999>:

"It appears as if the power\_system method exposed in the xmlrpc api is vulnerable to command injection through either the system handle(I am not sure about this one :-)) the provided password or the username.

The api.py code features the following:

def power\_on(self, system, user=None, password=None, logger=None):

"""

Powers up a system that has power management configured.

"""

return action\_power.PowerTool(self.\_config,system,self,user,password,logger=logger).power("on")

and in action\_power.py the following code is found under the 'power' method

```
def power(self, desired_state):
  ...
  template = self.get_command_template()
    template_file = open(template, "r")

    meta = utils.blender(self.api, False, self.system)
    meta["power_mode"] = desired_state

    # allow command line overrides of the username/password
    if self.force_user is not None:
       meta["power_user"] = self.force_user
    if self.force_pass is not None:
       meta["power_pass"] = self.force_pass

    tmp = templar.Templar(self.api._config)
    cmd = tmp.render(template_file, meta, None, self.system)
    template_file.close()

    cmd = cmd.strip()
    ...
    # use shell so we can have mutliple power commands chained together
    cmd = ['/bin/sh','-c', cmd]

    # Try the power command 5 times before giving up.
    # Some power switches are flakey
    for x in range(0,5):
        output, rc = utils.subprocess_sp(self.logger, cmd, shell=False)
  see [0] for some of the source code in the utils.subprocess_sp method.

```

while the shell=False is passed (eventually) through to the subprocess.Popen method, as the shell /bin/sh[1] has been provided in front of the command passed in shell meta-characters will be actually be a problem. As far as I can tell the template cmd rendering will not strip out shell meta-characters and opens up a command injection attack vector.

[0] utils.subprocess\_sp(found in utils.py) just does the following -->

def subprocess\_sp(logger, cmd, shell=True):

if logger is not None:

logger.info("running: %s" % cmd)

try:

sp = sub\_process.Popen(cmd, shell=shell, stdout=sub\_process.PIPE, stderr=sub\_process.PIPE, close\_fds=True)

...

[1] To verify that this is the case you test it out -->

> > > import subprocess
> > >
> > > subprocess.Popen(["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo lol && /bin/sh"], shell=False)
> > >
> > > <subprocess.Popen object at 0x7f0ecaa92b50>
> > >
> > > lol
> > >
> > > sh-4.1$"

Comment [#1](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/1):

"Without hitting the xmlrpc directly(just using a local python test script) I was able to inject shell commands by providing the following user-name:

";my command goes here ;" (when the power\_rsa.template file was the selected power template)."

The Launchpad bug is currently private. I would be happy to give you access if you have a Launchpad account.

### Bug Description

It appears as if the power\_system method exposed in the xmlrpc api is vulnerable to command injection through either the system handle(I am not sure about this one :-)) the provided password or the username.

The api.py code features the following:

    def power\_on(self, system, user=None, password=None, logger=None):

        """

        Powers up a system that has power management configured.

        """

        return action\_power.PowerTool(self.\_config,system,self,user,password,logger=logger).power("on")

and in action\_power.py the following code is found under the 'power' method

def power(self, desired\_state):

      ...

      template = self.get\_command\_template()

        template\_file = open(template, "r")

meta = utils.blender(self.api, False, self.system)

        meta["power\_mode"] = desired\_state

# allow command line overrides of the username/password

        if self.force\_user is not None:

           meta["power\_user"] = self.force\_user

        if self.force\_pass is not None:

           meta["power\_pass"] = self.force\_pass

tmp = templar.Templar(self.api.\_config)

        cmd = tmp.render(template\_file, meta, None, self.system)

        template\_file.close()

cmd = cmd.strip()

        ...

        # use shell so we can have mutliple power commands chained together

        cmd = ['/bin/sh','-c', cmd]

# Try the power command 5 times before giving up.

        # Some power switches are flakey

        for x in range(0,5):

            output, rc = utils.subprocess\_sp(self.logger, cmd, shell=False)

      see [0] for some of the source code in the utils.subprocess\_sp method.

while the shell=False is passed (eventually) through to the subprocess.Popen method, as the shell /bin/sh[1] has been provided in front of the command passed in shell meta-characters will be actually be a problem. As far as I can tell the template cmd rendering will not strip out shell meta-characters and opens up a command injection attack vector.

[0] utils.subprocess\_sp(found in utils.py) just does the following -->

def subprocess\_sp(logger, cmd, shell=True):

    if logger is not None:

        logger.info("running: %s" % cmd)

    try:

        sp = sub\_process.Popen(cmd, shell=shell, stdout=sub\_process.PIPE, stderr=sub\_process.PIPE, close\_fds=True)
