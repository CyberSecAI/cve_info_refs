## Description

Allows a user to associate a profile photo with their account through their “Your Profile” page. Admins may

add a user profile photo by accessing the “Edit User” page. Uploaded images are resized to fit the dimensions specified

on the options page; a thumbnail image correspondingly is also generated.

User photos may be displayed within a post or a comment to

help identify the author. New template tags introduced are:

* `userphoto_the_author_photo()`
* `userphoto_the_author_thumbnail()`
* `userphoto_comment_author_photo()`
* `userphoto_comment_author_thumbnail()`

*Important: all of these “template tags” must appear inside of PHP script blocks (see examples below).*

The first two should be placed in the posts loop near `the_author()`, and the second two in the comments

loop near `comment_author()` (or their respective equivalents). Furthermore, `userphoto_the_author_photo()`

and `userphoto_the_author_thumbnail()` may be called anywhere (i.e. sidebar) if `$authordata` is set.

The output of these template tags may be modified by passing four parameters: `$before`, `$after`, `$attributes`, and `$default_src`,

as in: `userphoto_the_author_photo($before, $after, $attributes, $default_src)`.

If the user photo exists (or `$default_src` is supplied), then the text provided in the `$before` and `$after` parameters is respectively

prefixed and suffixed to the generated `img` tag (a common pattern in WordPress). If attributes are provided in the `$attributes`

parameter, then they are returned as attributes of the generated `img` element. For example: `userphoto_the_author_photo('', '', array(style => 'border:0'))`

Just added in 0.8.1 release are these two new template tags:

* `userphoto($user, $before = '', $after = '', $attributes = array(), $default_src = '')`
* `userphoto_thumbnail($user, $before = '', $after = '', $attributes = array(), $default_src = '')`

By using these, it is uneccessary to set the global `$authordata` to display a photo. Just pass `$authordata`, `$curauth` or

whatever variable you have which contains the user object, or (as of version 0.9), pass in a user ID or a user login name.

Here’s an example that shows a few ways of inserting a user’s photo into the post loop:

//this will display the user’s avatar if they don’t have a user photo,

```
<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
    <div class="post" id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>">
        <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
        <div class="meta">
            <?php the_time('F jS, Y') ?>
            by <?php the_author() ?>

            <!-- displays the user's photo and then thumbnail -->
            <?php userphoto_the_author_photo() ?>
            <?php userphoto_the_author_thumbnail() ?>

            <!-- the following two do the same since $authordata populated -->
            <?php userphoto($authordata) ?>
            <?php userphoto_thumbnail($authordata) ?>

            <!-- and this is how to customize the output -->
            <?php userphoto_the_author_photo(
                '<b>Photo of me: ',
                '</b>',
                array('class' => 'photo'),
                get_template_directory_uri() . '/nophoto.jpg'
            ) ?>
        </div>
        <?php the_content('Read the rest of this entry &raquo;'); ?>
    </div>
<?php endwhile; ?>

```

If you want to display the user’s photo in the sidebar, just get the user ID or object and pass it into `userphoto()` or `userphoto_thumbnail()` like this:

```
<?php userphoto($posts[0]->post_author); ?>

```

If you want to display a user’s photo their author page, you may do this:

```
<?php userphoto($wp_query->get_queried_object()) ?>

```

In version 0.9 the boolean function `userphoto_exists($user)` has been introduced which returns true if the user has a photo and false if they do not.

Argument `$user` may be user object, ID, or login name. This function can be used along with avatars:

```
<?php
if(userphoto_exists($user))
    userphoto($user);
else
    echo get_avatar($user->ID, 96);
?>

```

Or if the new “Serve Avatar as Fallback” option is turned on, then the avatar will be served by any of the regular calls to display the user photo:

```
<?php
//this will display the user's avatar if they don't have a user photo,
//  and if "Serve Avatar as Fallback" is turned on
userphoto($user);
?>

```

Additionally, all of the regular function calls to display the user photo may be done away with alltogether if the new “Override Avatar with User Photo”

option is enabled:

```
<?php
//both will display the user photo if it exists
//  and if "Override Avatar with User Photo" is turned on
echo get_avatar($user_id);
echo get_avatar($user->user_email);
?>

```

Both options “Serve Avatar as Fallback” and “Override Avatar with User Photo” require that the ‘Avatar Display’ setting under Discussion be set to “Show”.

Uploaded images may be moderated by administrators via the “Edit User” page.

Localizations included for Spanish, German, Dutch, Polish, Russian, French, Hungarian, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, and Catalan.

#### Todo

1. When changing the authorization level, all previous users’ photos should be automatically approved if they meet the minimum user level
2. Include a get\_userphoto() and get\_userphoto\_thumbnail() ?
3. Add a management page to allow admins to quickly approve/reject user photos.
4. Add option so that when a photo is rejected, the user is notified.
5. Restrict image types acceptable?
6. Add an option to indicate a default photo to be used when none supplied.
