Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper data validation within the IBM Global Security Kit (GSKit) before version 8.0.14.22, specifically when handling data in the TLS Record Layer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper data validation:** The GSKit does not adequately validate data received in the TLS Record Layer, leading to a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to an application crash, causing a denial of service. The service becomes unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network via TLS.
- **Crafted values in the TLS Record Layer:** The attacker sends specially crafted values in the TLS Record Layer to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.
- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need authentication credentials to execute the exploit.
- **Crafted payload:**  The attacker must be capable of crafting the malicious data within the TLS Record Layer.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects IBM Rational Directory Server (Tivoli variant only) and other products that use vulnerable GSKit versions including IBM Rational Change, IBM Rational DOORS, IBM Rational Synergy.
- The specific fix is to upgrade to GSKit version 8.0.14.22.
- This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2012-2333, even though both exist in the same component.
- The CVSS score is 5.0, with a vector of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P), highlighting the potential for a network-based, low-complexity attack leading to a partial denial-of-service.
