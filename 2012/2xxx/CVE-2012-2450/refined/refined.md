Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A flaw exists in the SCSI device registration process within VMware products. This allows for an unchecked write into memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unchecked memory write: The vulnerability allows writing to arbitrary memory locations due to improper checks during SCSI device registration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Guest-to-host escape: A malicious guest user can exploit this vulnerability to crash the VMX process (Virtual Machine eXecutive, the core process of VMware virtual machines) on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Guest access: The attacker needs to have access to a virtual machine as a guest user.
- Specifically a root user for this particular vulnerability
- SCSI device manipulation: The vulnerability is triggered via manipulating the SCSI device registration

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Guest user privileges: The attacker needs to have an account within a virtual machine.
- Root privileges within the guest OS to perform the necessary SCSI operations.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable SCSI device registration mechanism to trigger the unchecked memory write.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple VMware products, including Workstation, Player, Fusion, ESXi, and ESX, across various versions.
- VMware has provided patches to address this vulnerability, as detailed in the advisory.
- A workaround involves removing the virtual SCSI controller from the list of virtual IO devices.
