Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-2521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has already been deleted. This improper handling of deleted objects leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Asynchronous NULL Object Access:** The vulnerability is characterized as an "Asynchronous NULL Object Access" issue, meaning the access to the deleted object happens asynchronously. This suggests a race condition or timing issue where the object is accessed after it has been freed.
-   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that when a deleted object is accessed, it leads to memory corruption. This corrupted memory can then be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This is the most significant impact, as it can allow an attacker to gain full control over a system.
-   **Privilege Escalation:**  If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains those same privileges. This enables the attacker to install programs, modify or delete data, and create new user accounts with full rights.
-  **System Compromise:** An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can take complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then attempt to trick a user into visiting this site.
-  **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject the malicious code into compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content (e.g., forums, comment sections).
-   **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince users to take an action such as clicking a link or opening an attachment. This is often done through email or instant messaging.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote Position:** The attacker doesn't require any direct access to the target system. Exploitation can be achieved remotely by enticing the user to interact with malicious content.
-   **Technical Expertise:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted web page or an exploit that targets the specific vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
-   **Social Engineering:** An attacker needs the ability to convince the user to visit a malicious web site or open a malicious email.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects different versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, and 9) on various Windows client and server operating systems.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, preventing access to deleted objects.
