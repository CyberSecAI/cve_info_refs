  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The security update RHSA-2012:0103 for SquirrelMail did not correctly address the issue described in CVE-2010-2813. Specifically, the patch to prevent the creation of user preference files during failed login attempts with passwords containing 8-bit characters was not applied correctly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of failed login attempts.",
      "Creation of user preference files with invalid usernames, leading to disk space exhaustion.",
       "Incorrect patching of a previous vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by repeatedly attempting to log in with invalid usernames but with passwords containing 8-bit characters. This would lead to excessive disk space consumption on the target SquirrelMail server due to the creation of numerous user preference files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote unauthenticated attackers can send crafted login requests."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the SquirrelMail login page, and have knowledge or be able to guess valid usernames. No special privileges are required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
      "description_update": "This vulnerability is a regression; it was supposedly fixed in RHSA-2012:0103, but the fix was not implemented correctly. This resulted in a vulnerability where a remote attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by consuming disk space by creating many user preference files with invalid login attempts and passwords with 8-bit characters. The new fix is provided in RHSA-2013:0126.",
