## Topic

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes one security issue and several
bugs is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

The SquirrelMail security update RHSA-2012:0103 did not, unlike the erratum
text stated, correct the CVE-2010-2813 issue, a flaw in the way
SquirrelMail handled failed log in attempts. A user preference file was
created when attempting to log in with a password containing an 8-bit
character, even if the username was not valid. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to eventually consume all hard disk space on the target
SquirrelMail server. (CVE-2012-2124)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, SquirrelMail could not decode multi-line subjects

properly. Consequently, the decode header internationalization option did
not properly handle new lines or tabs at the beginning of the lines. This
bug has been fixed and SquirrelMail now works correctly in the described
scenario. (BZ#241861)

* Due to a bug, attachments written in HTML code on the Windows operating

system were not displayed properly when accessed with SquirrelMail; the
"!=null" string was trimmed to "!ull". This bug has been fixed and the
attachments are now displayed correctly in such a case. (BZ#359791)

* Previously, e-mail messages with a Unique Identifier (UID) larger than

2^31 bytes were unreadable when using the squirrelmail package. With this
patch the squirrelmail package is able to read all messages regardless of
the UIDs size. (BZ#450780)

* Due to a bug, a PHP script did not assign the proper character set to

requested variables. Consequently, SquirrelMail could not display any
e-mails. The underlying source code has been modified and now the
squirrelmail package assigns the correct character set. (BZ#475188)

* Due to the incorrect internationalization option located at the i18n.php

file, the squirrelmail package could not use the GB 2312 character set. The
i18n.php file has been fixed and the GB 2312 character set works correctly
in the described scenario. (BZ#508686)

* Previously, the preg\_split() function contained a misspelled constant,

PREG\_SPLIT\_NI\_EMPTY, which could cause SquirrelMail to produce error
messages. The name of the constant has been corrected to
PREG\_SPLIT\_NO\_EMPTY, and SquirrelMail no longer produces error messages in
this scenario. (BZ#528758)

* Due to Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) settings, sending e-mails from

the SquirrelMail web interface was blocked. This update adds a note to the
SquirrelMail documentation that describes how to set the SELinux options to
allow sending e-mails from the SquirrelMail web interface. (BZ#745380)

* Previously, the squirrelmail package did not comply with the RFC 2822

specification about line length limits. Consequently, attachments with
lines longer than 998 characters could not be forwarded using SquirrelMail.
This patch modifies the underlying source code and now SquirrelMail
complies with the RFC 2822 specification as expected. (BZ#745469)

* Prior to this update, the squirrelmail package required the php-common

script instead of the mod\_php script during installation or upgrade of the
package, which led to a dependency error. As a result, attempting to
install or upgrade the squirrelmail package failed on systems using the
php53 packages. With this update, the dependencies of the squirrelmail
package were changed and the installation or upgrade now works correctly in
the described scenario. (BZ#789353)

All users of SquirrelMail are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0103)

## Topic

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail
performed the sanitization of HTML style tag content. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) message that, when opened by a victim, would lead to
arbitrary web script execution in the context of their SquirrelMail
session. (CVE-2011-2023)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in SquirrelMail. A
remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to execute arbitrary web
script in the context of a victim's SquirrelMail session. (CVE-2010-4555)

An input sanitization flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled the
content of various HTML input fields. A remote attacker could use this
flaw to alter user preference values via a newline character contained in
the input for these fields. (CVE-2011-2752)

It was found that the SquirrelMail Empty Trash and Index Order pages did
not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into SquirrelMail, into
visiting a specially-crafted URL, the attacker could empty the victim's
trash folder or alter the ordering of the columns on the message index
page. (CVE-2011-2753)

SquirrelMail was allowed to be loaded into an HTML sub-frame, allowing a
remote attacker to perform a clickjacking attack against logged in users
and possibly gain access to sensitive user data. With this update, the
SquirrelMail main frame can only be loaded into the top most browser frame.
(CVE-2010-4554)

A flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled failed log in attempts. A
user preference file was created when attempting to log in with a password
containing an 8-bit character, even if the username was not valid. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to eventually consume all hard disk
space on the target SquirrelMail server. (CVE-2010-2813)

A flaw was found in the SquirrelMail Mail Fetch plug-in. If an
administrator enabled this plug-in, a SquirrelMail user could use this flaw
to port scan the local network the server was on. (CVE-2010-1637)

Users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Subject: CVE-2012-2124 assignment notification: squirrelmail: CVE-2010-2813
 not fixed in RHSA-2012:0103

Hi,

A Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2012:0103 for squirrelmail packages
shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 claim to have fixed
CVE-2010-2813 issue. However, the patch for this issue was not applied
correctly and hence the issue was not fixed as stated in the advisory.

A situation like this requires the assignment of a new, vendor-specific
CVE for the broken/incomplete fix. Thus, CVE-2012-2124 has been assigned
to this issue.

We apologize to upstream / distros for the confusion this additional
CVE assignment may cause and want to make it explicit this is assigned
to an issue in RHEL packages unlikely to affect anyone else (except of
RHEL downstream distros).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=789353#c0)  Richard Allen    2012-02-10 15:01:46 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Red Hat recently released a security update for squirrelmail in rhel5.  This update can not be installed on systems using the php53 packages.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): squirrelmail.noarch 0:1.4.8-5.el5_7.13  How reproducible: Every time  Steps to Reproduce: 1. yum update on a rhel5 system using php53 2. 3.    Actual results: Updating fails with the following messages  [root@babylon5 mail]# yum update Loaded plugins: downloadonly, priorities, rhnplugin Setting up Update Process Resolving Dependencies --> Running transaction check ---> Package squirrelmail.noarch 0:1.4.8-5.el5_7.13 set to be updated --> Processing Dependency: php >= 4.0.4 for package: squirrelmail --> Processing Dependency: php-mbstring for package: squirrelmail --> Running transaction check ---> Package php.i386 0:5.1.6-27.el5_7.5 set to be updated --> Processing Dependency: php-common = 5.1.6-27.el5_7.5 for package: php --> Processing Dependency: php-cli = 5.1.6-27.el5_7.5 for package: php ---> Package php-mbstring.i386 0:5.1.6-27.el5_7.5 set to be updated --> Running transaction check ---> Package php-cli.i386 0:5.1.6-27.el5_7.5 set to be updated ---> Package php-common.i386 0:5.1.6-27.el5_7.5 set to be updated --> Processing Conflict: php53-common conflicts php-common --> Finished Dependency Resolution php53-common-5.3.3-1.el5_7.6.i386 from installed has depsolving problems   --> php53-common conflicts with php-common Error: php53-common conflicts with php-common  You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem  You could try running: package-cleanup --problems                         package-cleanup --dupes                         rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest The program package-cleanup is found in the yum-utils package.   Expected results: squirrelmail should be updatable...  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=789353#c1)  Richard Allen    2012-02-14 15:04:28 UTC  ``` This dependancy issue prevents me from applying securityfixes to internet facing servers.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=789353#c2)  Michal Hlavinka    2012-02-14 15:23:13 UTC  ``` Please remember that bugzilla is just a bug *tracking* tool. Issues, especially those where quick resolution is required, should be filed through <https://access.redhat.com/support> . That way we can deliver fix sooner. Otherwise it'll take some time - it'll get fixed only once component is approved with (any of) next RHEL minor release.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=789353#c3)  Richard Allen    2012-02-14 16:02:27 UTC  ``` Hi Michal  I'm sorry, I didnt know that bugs where to be reported there.  I've created a case there now (Case 00598938). Thanks for the heads up :)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=789353#c4)  Michal Hlavinka    2012-02-14 16:16:43 UTC  ``` Joe:  Do you know how is php53 supposed to work? Squirrelmail requires: php >= 4.0.4, php-mbstring. I thought php53 would Provides: php, but it doesn't.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=789353#c5)  Richard Allen    2012-02-14 18:46:44 UTC  ``` Making php53 Privide: php would solve quite a few problems...  On my system:  [root@babylon5 ~]# package-cleanup --problems Setting up yum Reading local RPM database Processing all local requires Missing dependencies: Package gallery2-gd requires php-gd Package squirrelmail requires php >= 4.0.4 Package squirrelmail requires php-mbstring Package php-pear-DB requires php-common >= 4.2.0 Package php-IDNA_Convert requires php Package phpmyadmin requires php-mysql >= 4.1.0 Package php-Smarty requires php >= 5.1.6-3.5 Package mediawiki requires php >= 5 Package mediawiki requires php-gd Package mediawiki requires php-mysql Package mediawiki requires php-pgsql Package mediawiki requires php-xml Package gallery2 requires php >= 4.3.0   All depencancy problems on this box are due to the php packages   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=789353#c7)  Joe Orton    2012-02-22 12:45:18 UTC  ``` squirrelmail should depend on mod_php, not php or php-common, this is not a php53 bug.  "Requires: php" doesn't mean much.  If you want /usr/bin/php, depend on php-cli or /usr/bin/php.  If you want the httpd module, depend on mod_php.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=789353#c9)  RHEL Program Management    2012-04-02 14:18:00 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux release.  Product Management has requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux release for currently deployed products.  This request is not yet committed for inclusion in a release.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=789353#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-08 04:59:50 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
