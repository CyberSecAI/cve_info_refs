**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-2371

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the WP-FaceThumb WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the output, leading to the possibility of executing arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS (CWE-79):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This means that the malicious script is injected into the request and reflected back to the user within the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:**  An attacker could potentially steal cookies to hijack user sessions.
- **Malicious Redirects:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the content of the page viewed by the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript. This URL would need to be delivered to a victim, typically via social engineering.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must click on the malicious link or be redirected to it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create a malicious URL:** The attacker needs the ability to create a URL that includes the malicious payload.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a victim to click the malicious link.
- **No specific privilege or position is needed:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target system to perform the attack
