  Hello,

  This plugin is vulnerable to refected XSS security vulnerability.

  [removed for security]

  I haven‚Äôt verified this nor checked your plugins code. Could you tell me if this is indeed a valid report and if yes when do you plan to fix this?

  Please note that I am more than happy to provide help to fix this issue in case you need any.

  FYI, please don‚Äôt post possible security issues like that in the forums. If it IS an issue, you‚Äôve given the hack to more people. If not, it can hurt a legit plugin. YOu did the right thing by emailing plugins @ wordpress.org ‚Äì We‚Äôll look into it üôÇ

  This was public issue already. I did not create the original announcement. More people can be affected by it if nobody knows about issue in the forums/WP community. XSS issues are usually so simple that people can even patch those by themselves if no patch is available from vendor (in this case plugin maintainer) or even in cases where vendor says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have time to fix this‚Äù or similar explanation even the issue is verified.

  Do I get some kind of reply from plugins@ address if I notify about security vulnerabilities?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

  Hello,

  This plugin is vulnerable to refected XSS security vulnerability.

  [removed for security]

  I haven‚Äôt verified this nor checked your plugins code. Could you tell me if this is indeed a valid report and if yes when do you plan to fix this?

  Please note that I am more than happy to provide help to fix this issue in case you need any.

  FYI, please don‚Äôt post possible security issues like that in the forums. If it IS an issue, you‚Äôve given the hack to more people. If not, it can hurt a legit plugin. YOu did the right thing by emailing plugins @ wordpress.org ‚Äì We‚Äôll look into it üôÇ

  This was public issue already. I did not create the original announcement. More people can be affected by it if nobody knows about issue in the forums/WP community. XSS issues are usually so simple that people can even patch those by themselves if no patch is available from vendor (in this case plugin maintainer) or even in cases where vendor says ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have time to fix this‚Äù or similar explanation even the issue is verified.

  Do I get some kind of reply from plugins@ address if I notify about security vulnerabilities?

  I have not verified this yet. I am not the original founder of this vulnerability.
