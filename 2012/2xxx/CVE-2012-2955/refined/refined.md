Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the administrative user interface of IBM ISS Proventia Mail Security. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in pages where it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript code through an HTTP request query string. This is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The application doesn't properly sanitize input from the HTTP request query string, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize the input received through the query string before displaying it in the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies, granting them unauthorized access to user sessions.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By stealing session cookies, an attacker can potentially take over a user's authenticated session.
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** The attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser, leading to various attacks such as data theft, redirection, or defacement.
*   **Access to Files:** According to the provided text, although not explicitly stated in the description for CVE-2012-2955, the advisory for CVE-2012-2202 states that file content can be accessed via an unvalidated parameter, which is also related to the same product.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Query Strings:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request containing JavaScript code within the query string.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to lure a legitimate user to click on the crafted malicious link or access the manipulated page within the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the Target System:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge about the installed product.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker must be able to create URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads in the query string.
*   **Ability to Induce User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a victim user to access the specially crafted URL while being logged in.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability requires a user to be authenticated to the web interface for exploitation.
*   The provided text links this vulnerability to a second vulnerability, CVE-2012-2202, which is an arbitrary file read vulnerability within the same product.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Offensive Security.
*   The provided document includes a CVSS score of 4.3 for this vulnerability.

**Summary:**

CVE-2012-2955 is a reflected XSS vulnerability in IBM ISS Proventia Mail Security that allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript through HTTP request parameters. Successful exploitation can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, and arbitrary script execution, potentially granting the attacker control over the user's session and information. This vulnerability requires the user to be logged into the administrative interface and for the attacker to craft and distribute malicious URLs.
