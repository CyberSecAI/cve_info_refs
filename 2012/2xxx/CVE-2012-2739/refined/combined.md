## Hash table implementations vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#903934

Original Release Date: 2011-12-28 | Last Revised: 2016-02-15

---

### Overview

Some programming language implementations do not sufficiently randomize their hash functions or provide means to limit key collision attacks, which can be leveraged by an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

### Description

| Many applications, including common web framework implementations, use hash tables to map key values to associated entries. If the hash table contains entries for different keys that map to the same hash value, a hash collision occurs and additional processing is required to determine which entry is appropriate for the key. If an attacker can generate many requests containing colliding key values, an application performing the hash table lookup may enter a denial of service condition.  Hash collision denial-of-service attacks were first [detailed](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf) in 2003, but [recent research](http://www.nruns.com/_downloads/advisory28122011.pdf) details how these attacks apply to modern language hash table implementations. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An application can be forced into a denial-of-service condition. In the case of some web application servers, specially-crafted POST form data may result in a denial-of-service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Please review the Vendor Information section of this document for vendor-specific patch and workaround details. |
| --- |

| **Limit CPU time**Limiting the processing time for a single request can help minimize the impact of malicious requests.**Limit maximum POST size**Limiting the maximum POST request size can reduce the number of possible predictable collisions, thus reducing the impact of an attack. **Limit maximum request parameters**Some servers offer the option to limit the number of parameters per request, which can also minimize impact. |

### [The PHP Group](#DWAN-8PYMFT) Affected

Updated:  December 28, 2011

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

According to the n.runs AG advisory:
"PHP 5 uses the DJBX33A (Dan Bernstein's times 33, addition) hash function and parses POST form data into the $\_POST hash table. Because of the structure of the hash function, it is vulnerable to an equivalent substring attack."

From the Workarounds section:
"The easiest way to reduce the impact of such an attack is to reduce the CPU time that a request is allowed to take. For PHP, this can be configured using the max\_input\_time parameter."

PHP 5.4.0 RC4 has been released which adds a max\_input\_vars directive to help mitigate hash collision attacks. Please note that this is a release candidate, not a stable release.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=750533#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-01 14:13:47 UTC  ``` Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink reported that the String.hashCode() hash function is not sufficiently collision resistant.  hashCode() value is used in the implementations of HashMap and Hashtable classes:  <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html> <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html>  A specially-crafted set of keys could trigger hash function collisions, which can degrade performance of HashMap or Hashtable by changing hash table operations complexity from an expected/average O(1) to the worst case O(n).  Reporters were able to find colliding strings efficiently using equivalent substrings and meet in the middle techniques.  This problem can be used to start a denial of service attack against Java applications that use untrusted inputs as HashMap or Hashtable keys.  An example of such application is web application server (such as tomcat, see [bug #750521](show_bug.cgi?id=750521 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-4858 tomcat: hash table collisions CPU usage DoS (oCERT-2011-003)")) that may fill hash tables with data from HTTP request (such as GET or POST parameters).  A remote attack could use that to make JVM use excessive amount of CPU time by sending a POST request with large amount of parameters which hash to the same value.  This problem is similar to the issue that was previously reported for and fixed in e.g. perl:   <http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=750533#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-01 14:18:44 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=750533#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2011-12-29 12:23:27 UTC  ``` This issue was presented on 28C3: <http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/events/4680.en.html>  Details were posted to full-disclosure: <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Dec/477>  oCERT advisory: <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2011-003.html>  n.runs advisory (copy of the full-disclosure post): <http://www.nruns.com/_downloads/advisory28122011.pdf>  28C3 slides and recording: <http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fahrplan/attachments/2007_28C3_Effective_DoS_on_web_application_platforms.pdf> <http://www.youtube.com/28c3#p/u/22/R2Cq3CLI6H8>  Another good write-up of the issue: <http://cryptanalysis.eu/blog/2011/12/28/effective-dos-attacks-against-web-application-plattforms-hashdos/>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=750533#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2011-12-29 12:40:08 UTC  ``` Upstream does not believe this issue should be addressed in Java language itself, and rather needs to be addressed in affected applications.  28C3 slides quote following Oracle Security Team statement:    As for Java itself, it does not seem like there is anything that would   require a change in Java hashmap implementation.

Dear OpenJDK CoreLibs community,

A significant enhancement to the Java SE hashing-based Map implementations in planned for inclusion in Java SE 7u6. All of the hashing based Map implementations: HashMap, Hashtable, LinkedHashMap, WeakHashMap and ConcurrentHashMap will now use an enhanced hashing algorithm for string keys when the capacity of the hash table has ever grown beyond 512 entries. The enhanced hashing implementation uses the murmur3 hashing algorithm[1] along with random hash seeds and index masks. These enhancements mitigate cases where colliding String hash values could result in a performance bottleneck.

In order to provide the greatest opportunity for developers to test compatibility with their applications this change will be incorporated into JDK7u6 build 12 and JDK8 build 39. Both builds are planned for release next week. ***For 7u6 build 12 only, the alternative hashing will be unconditionally enabled (always on).*** The threshold default will be reset to the intended release default (512) for 7u6 build 13.

The quick promotion of this change into builds with limited opportunity for public review and the special behaviour for build 12 is intended to make it easier for developers to test their application compatibility. Feedback on the approach, implementation, compatibility and performance is eagerly sought and encouraged both before *and after* this change is incorporated into the OpenJDK repositories.

A new system property, jdk.map.althashing.threshold, allows adjustment of the threshold for enabling the enhanced hashing algorithm. If changed from the default value of 512, the enhanced hashing will be invoked any time after map capacity exceeds the value of jdk.map.althashing.threshold. To completely disable the enhanced hashing (not recommended), set jdk.map.althashing.threshold to -1 or a very large number such as 2^31 -1 (Integer.MAX_VALUE).

The iteration order of keys, values and entries for hash-based maps where the new algorithm has been invoked will vary for each HashMap instance. While the Java SE Map documentation makes no promises that iteration order of items returned from Maps will be consistent, developers should check if their applications have incorrectly created a dependency on the iteration order of Map entries, keys or values.

Webrevs for the Java 7u6 and 8 changes are available for download at [2] and [3] for your review. There are some important differences between the Java 7 and 8 implementations of this enhancement. Most specifically in the Java 8 implementation alternative string hashing is always enabled--no threshold is used for enablement and alternative hashing cannot be disabled. (The Java 8 implementation completely ignores the jdk.map.althashing.threshold system property). The Java 8 implementation is also subject to additional refinement as Java 8 develops.

If you have any questions or concerns with this planned enhancement, please use the corelibs development mailing list, <mailto:[core-libs-dev at openjdk.java.net](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/core-libs-dev)>, or you may also respond privately to me if you prefer.

Thanks,

Mike

**oCERT-2011-003 multiple implementations denial-of-service via hash algorithm collision**

**Description**:

A variety of programming languages suffer from a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition against storage functions of key/value pairs in hash data structures,
the condition can be leveraged by exploiting predictable collisions in the
underlying hashing algorithms.

The issue finds particular exposure in web server applications and/or
frameworks. In particular, the lack of sufficient limits for the number of
parameters in POST requests in conjunction with the predictable collision
properties in the hashing functions of the underlying languages can render web
applications vulnerable to the DoS condition. The attacker, using specially
crafted HTTP requests, can lead to a 100% of CPU usage which can last up to
several hours depending on the targeted application and server performance, the
amplification effect is considerable and requires little bandwidth and time on
the attacker side.

The condition for predictable collisions in the hashing functions has
been reported for the following language implementations:
[Java](http://www.java.com),
[JRuby](http://jruby.org/),
[PHP](http://www.php.net/),
[Python](http://python.org/),
[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/),
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).
In the case of the Ruby language, the 1.9.x branch is not affected
by the predictable collision condition since this version includes a
randomization of the hashing function.

The vulnerability outlined in this advisory is practically identical to the one
reported in 2003 and described in the paper
[Denial of Service via Algorithmic Complexity Attacks](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf)

Subject: CVE request: java hashdos vulnerability

Hi,

Seems java is fixing HashDos finally:
<http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2012-May/010238.html>

They don't mention hashdos, but the interesting part is here:
"The enhanced hashing implementation uses the murmur3 hashing
algorithm[1] along with random hash seeds and index masks"

random hash seeds is what prevents hashdos.

Further info here:
<http://armoredbarista.blogspot.de/2012/02/investigating-hashdos-issue.html>

Please assign CVE.

cu,
