Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-2739:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the use of insufficiently collision-resistant hash functions in various programming languages' hash table implementations (specifically `HashMap` and `Hashtable` in Java). These hash functions can be exploited to create many colliding keys, degrading the performance of hash table lookups from O(1) to O(n) in the worst-case scenario.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Predictable Hash Collisions:** The primary weakness lies in the predictability of hash collisions. Attackers can craft input data (e.g., POST parameters in web requests) that generate many keys with the same hash value, leading to a large number of collisions in the hash table.
*   **Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the algorithmic complexity of hash table operations. When collisions occur, the performance of lookups, insertions, and deletions degrades significantly.
*   **Lack of Hash Randomization:** Some language implementations do not sufficiently randomize their hash functions, making them susceptible to collision attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a DoS condition by exploiting predictable hash collisions. By sending many requests containing colliding keys, the application performing hash table lookups can be forced into excessive CPU consumption, leading to performance degradation or unavailability.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The application can be forced to use an excessive amount of CPU time and memory when processing a large number of colliding keys.
*   **Application Unresponsiveness:**  A successful attack can make an application unresponsive and unable to serve legitimate user requests.
*   **Web Application Vulnerability:** Web application servers are particularly vulnerable, as attackers can exploit this issue by sending specially crafted POST requests with many colliding parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send crafted HTTP POST requests with a large number of parameters that result in hash collisions when processed by the web application server.
*   **Untrusted Inputs:** Any application that uses untrusted input as keys for hash maps is potentially vulnerable, as attackers can craft input data to cause collisions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable application or service.
*   **Ability to Craft Inputs:** The attacker needs the ability to craft inputs that generate predictable hash collisions. For web applications, this typically involves crafting HTTP requests with colliding POST parameters.
*   **Knowledge of Hash Function:** While not always strictly necessary, some understanding of the hash function being used can assist in crafting effective collision attacks.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is not new; it was previously identified in 2003 with Perl.
*   Affected programming languages include Java, JRuby, PHP, Python, Rubinius, and Ruby (older versions).
*   The issue is more dangerous when there are no limits on the number of request parameters.
*   Mitigations include limiting the number of request parameters, limiting POST sizes, and limiting request processing times.
*   Java 7u6 (build 12) introduced an alternative hashing algorithm (Murmur3 with random hash seeds) to mitigate the problem, with subsequent builds defaulting to enabling it when the map capacity exceeds 512.
*   Java 8 always enables alternative hashing and ignores the threshold property.

**CVE-2012-2739** is used as a general identifier for the Java implementation's vulnerability, but several CVEs were assigned for other affected software. The provided information confirms the Red Hat bugzilla entry which directly relates the issue to CVE-2012-2739.
