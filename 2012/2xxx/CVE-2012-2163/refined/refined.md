- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the SONAS command-line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI). This allows administrative users to inject commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code injection vulnerability via the command-line interface and graphical user interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows administrative users to execute commands as root.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the command line interface (CLI) and the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an administrative user of the SONAS system.
