### Summary

[Nathan Partlan](http://greywhind.wordpress.com/) and I discovered and reported vulnerabilities in two
common Flash applets, [SWFUpload](http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/) and [Plupload](http://www.plupload.com/). SWFUpload’s
developers have not released a fix for the XSS issue identified.
Plupload’s developers have released [v1.5.4](http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=1685) to address the identified
CSRF issue.

Both of these applets are present in Wordpress installations. These
vulnerabilities were addressed as part of [Wordpress 3.3.2](http://wordpress.org/news/2012/04/wordpress-3-3-2/).

### Vulnerability #1: XSS in SWFUpload (CVE-2012-3414)

The latest version of SWFUpload ([ActionScript code available here](http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/source/browse/swfupload/trunk/core/Flash/SWFUpload.as?spec=svn916&r=852))
contains the following code:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ``` | ``` // Get the movie name this.movieName = root.loaderInfo.parameters.movieName;  // **Configure the callbacks** // The JavaScript tracks all the instances of SWFUpload on a page.  We can access the instance // associated with this SWF file using the movieName.  Each callback is accessible by making // a call directly to it on our instance.  There is no error handling for undefined callback functions. // A developer would have to deliberately remove the default functions,set the variable to null, or remove // it from the init function. this.flashReady_Callback         = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].flashReady"; this.fileDialogStart_Callback    = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].fileDialogStart"; this.fileQueued_Callback         = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].fileQueued"; this.fileQueueError_Callback     = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].fileQueueError"; this.fileDialogComplete_Callback = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].fileDialogComplete";  this.uploadStart_Callback        = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadStart"; this.uploadProgress_Callback     = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadProgress"; this.uploadError_Callback        = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadError"; this.uploadSuccess_Callback      = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadSuccess";  this.uploadComplete_Callback     = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadComplete";  this.debug_Callback              = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].debug";  this.testExternalInterface_Callback = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].testExternalInterface"; this.cleanUp_Callback            = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].cleanUp"; this.buttonAction_Callback       = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].buttonAction";  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Each of those callbacks is used as the first parameter to
[ExternalInterface.call](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/external/ExternalInterface.html), which executes JavaScript in the context of
the current page. Since movieName is derived from user input (a Flash
parameter) and a Flash applet can be loaded directly (with parameters in
the URL), the Flash applet allows for reflected cross-site scripting.
For sites where the applet is hosted on the same domain as the main
website, this is a serious security concern.

At this point, I’m not aware of a patched version of the applet source
(let me know in the comments if there is one!). My suggestion would be
to filter the movieName parameter so that only alpha-numeric characters
are allowed.

Proof of Concept:
[http://demo.swfupload.org/v220/swfupload/swfupload.swf?movieName=%22%5d%29;}catch%28e%29{}if%28!self.a%29self.a=!alert%281%29;//](http://demo.swfupload.org/v220/swfupload/swfupload.swf?movieName=%22]%29;}catch%28e%29{}if%28!self.a%29self.a=!alert%281%29;//)

### Vulnerability #2: CSRF in Plupload (CVE-2012-3415)

The Plupload applet called `Security.allowDomain('*')` to allow the
applet to be used from any domain (so it could be served from S3, for
instance). That meant people could interact with the Plupload applet
from any other site on the Internet by embedding it on a page and using
JavaScript. But due to the way the same-origin policy works in Flash,
the applet could still make requests back to the domain on which it was
hosted. In addition, people can specify the full URL for an upload
request via JavaScript and the result of that request (ie: the HTML of
the resulting page) is passed back via JavaScript to the embedding page.

So, if an attacker could convince a target to interact with the applet
(by selecting a single file to be uploaded), the attacker could make a
request to the domain that the applet was hosted on and read back the
full response. That could disclose CSRF tokens or other sensitive
information. This issue was especially important for Wordpress
installations, where Plupload applets are hosted inside of the
wp-includes directory by default.

The issue was resolved by removing the call to
`Security.allowDomain('*')` by default.

### Conclusion

Third-party Flash applets are vulnerable to many of the same sorts of
attacks as other parts of web applications. However, they are often
included in sites without a proper understanding of the security risks.

***Update (08/01/2012):*** I’ve updated the post to include the CVE
identifiers assigned to these vulnerabilities.

# WordPress 3.3.2 (and WordPress 3.4 Beta 3)

---

[WordPress 3.3.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) is available now and is a security update for all previous versions.

Three external libraries included in WordPress received security updates:

* Plupload (version 1.5.4), which WordPress uses for uploading media.
* SWFUpload, which WordPress previously used for uploading media, and may still be in use by plugins.
* SWFObject, which WordPress previously used to embed Flash content, and may still be in use by plugins and themes.

Thanks to [Neal Poole](https://nealpoole.com/blog/) and [Nathan Partlan](http://greywhind.wordpress.com/) for [responsibly disclosing](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security) the bugs in Plupload and SWFUpload, and [Szymon Gruszecki](http://mars.iti.pk.edu.pl/~grucha/) for a separate bug in SWFUpload.

WordPress 3.3.2 also addresses:

* Limited privilege escalation where a site administrator could deactivate network-wide plugins when running a WordPress network under particular circumstances, disclosed by [Jon Cave](http://joncave.co.uk/) of our WordPress core security team, and [Adam Backstrom](http://sixohthree.com/).
* Cross-site scripting vulnerability when making URLs clickable, by Jon Cave.
* Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in redirects after posting comments in older browsers, and when filtering URLs. Thanks to [Mauro Gentile](http://www.sneaked.net/) for responsibly disclosing these issues to the security team.

These issues were fixed by the WordPress core security team. Five other bugs were also fixed in version 3.3.2. Consult the [change log](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.3?rev=20552&stop_rev=20087) for more details.

[Download WordPress 3.3.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) or update now from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

---

### WordPress 3.4 Beta 3 also available

Our development of WordPress 3.4 development continues. Today we are proud to release Beta 3 for testing. [Nearly 90 changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk?rev=20552&stop_rev=20450) have been made since Beta 2, released 9 days ago. (We are aiming for a beta every week.)

This is still beta software, so **we don’t recommend that you use it on production sites**. But if you’re a plugin developer, a theme developer, or a site administrator, **you should be running this on your test environments** and [reporting any bugs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs) you find. (See the [known issues here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5).) If you’re a WordPress user who wants to open your presents early, take advantage of WordPress’s famous 5-minute install and spin up a secondary test site. [Let us know what you think](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta)!

Version 3.4 Beta 3 includes all of the fixes included in version 3.3.2. [Download WordPress 3.4 Beta 3](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.4-beta3.zip) or use the [WordPress Beta Tester](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) plugin.

Debian Bug     : 670124

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool.  As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead
of backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2+dfsg-1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
