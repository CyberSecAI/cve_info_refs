### Summary
The provided content details a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SWFUpload and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Plupload, both of which are Flash applets. The vulnerabilities were discovered by Neal Poole and Nathan Partlan and were addressed in WordPress 3.3.2.

### Root Cause of Vulnerability
*   **SWFUpload XSS:** The `movieName` parameter, derived from user input, is used to construct JavaScript callback strings. Because this parameter is not sanitized, it allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript.
*   **Plupload CSRF:**  Plupload used `Security.allowDomain('*')`, allowing any domain to interact with the applet. This, combined with the ability to specify a URL for upload requests, allowed an attacker to make requests to the domain hosting the applet and read the response.

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities
*   **SWFUpload:**
    *   Unsanitized user input (`movieName`) leading to XSS.
    *   Use of `ExternalInterface.call` with attacker-controlled strings.
*   **Plupload:**
    *   Use of `Security.allowDomain('*')`, which allows cross-domain interaction.
    *   Lack of CSRF protection allowing an attacker to make unauthorized requests.
    *   Disclosure of server responses.

### Impact of Exploitation
*   **SWFUpload XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser when they load the vulnerable SWF file. This can be used to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.
*   **Plupload CSRF:** An attacker can make requests to the vulnerable domain via the Plupload applet, potentially disclosing sensitive information (CSRF tokens).

### Attack Vectors
*   **SWFUpload XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in the `movieName` parameter. When a victim loads this URL with the SWF file, the JavaScript payload gets executed.
*   **Plupload CSRF:** The attacker embeds the Plupload applet on a webpage and uses JavaScript to trigger the upload functionality with the targeted URL. When the victim interacts with this malicious page, the applet will make a request to the targeted URL, and the attacker will get the response.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position
*   **SWFUpload XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim into loading the malicious URL.
*   **Plupload CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to trick the victim to visit a page that embed the vulnerable Plupload and also interact with it.
