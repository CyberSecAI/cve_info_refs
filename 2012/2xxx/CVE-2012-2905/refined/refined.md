Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Artiphp CMS stores database backups using the `backupDB()` utility.
*   These backups are saved within the web root at a predictable location and with a predictable filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Predictable Filenames:** The backup files are named according to a predictable pattern: `db_backup_[type].[yyyy-mm-dd].sql.gz`.
*  **Insecure Storage Location:** The backups are stored inside the web root directory which is accessible to the public.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** By downloading the database backup file, an attacker can access the entire database, including sensitive information like user credentials, application configurations, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct File Access:** The attacker can directly request the database backup file by accessing its URL using the predictable filename pattern.
    * The full path is `/artzone/artpublic/database/db_backup_[type].[yyyy-mm-dd].sql.gz`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Artiphp CMS.
*   **Knowledge of the Filename Pattern:** The attacker must know the location where the backups are stored and the naming pattern.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided exploit code scans through different years, months, and days to find the correct file.
*   The exploit code attempts to access `full`, `structure`, and `partial` backups.
*   The exploit code is written in PHP and takes the host and port as input.
*   The vulnerability exists in Artiphp CMS version 5.5.0 Neo (r422).
*   The advisory ID for this vulnerability is ZSL-2012-5091.
