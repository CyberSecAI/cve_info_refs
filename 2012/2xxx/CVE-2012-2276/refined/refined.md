Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-2276

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in multiple flaws within the EMC IRM License Server software, specifically:
  - A missing `*FIPS` fields during version compatibility checks leads to a NULL pointer dereference.
  - Sending continuous malformed commands causes the process to freeze.
  - Sending commands after an initial version check with an invalid version leads to NULL pointer dereferences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **NULL Pointer Dereference (A & C):** The software attempts to access memory through a NULL pointer in two scenarios:
        - During "version compat check" when `*FIPS` fields are missing.
        - When subsequent commands are sent after an invalid version is provided in the initial check.
  - **Resource Exhaustion/Process Freezing (B):** Sending a series of malformed "batch begin untethered" commands with line feeds in the ID causes the server process to freeze and consume resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of any of these vulnerabilities leads to the IRM server becoming unusable.  The `pvcontrol.exe` process remains active, but the server is no longer functional. This prevents authorized users from accessing protected content, as the server manages the necessary encryption keys and policies.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **Remote Exploitation:** All the vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely by sending specially crafted commands to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the IRM server over the network.
  - **Knowledge of Protocol:** The attacker must be able to craft specific commands to exploit the vulnerabilities (e.g.,  malformed version compat check, malformed batch begin commands).

**Additional Notes**
- The exploit-db content provides more details than the official CVE description. It identifies three specific bugs, provides code snippets, and proof of concept information.
- The advisory mentions that no fix was available initially, but was later released.
