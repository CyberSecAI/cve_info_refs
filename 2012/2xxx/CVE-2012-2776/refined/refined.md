The information does highlight multiple CVEs were fixed in version 0.11, indicating a variety of issues were addressed at the time, but does not elaborate on their individual root causes.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

Based on available information, it can be inferred that there is a vulnerability in FFmpeg before version 0.11, which could be exposed if user input is passed into the software in a specific manner. However, without knowing the specifics we can only state that a vulnerability exists, but not its precise nature (memory corruption, buffer overflow etc).

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is not explicitly stated. The description says that multiple CVEs were fixed with this patch, with "some [being] probable arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities".

**5. Attack Vectors:**

The vulnerability is linked to processing user-provided input by FFmpeg, and can be exploited in "played back" situations, indicating potentially a malformed file.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

The attacker needs to be able to provide manipulated/malformed input to FFmpeg, which could be done by tricking a user into processing a malicious media file. The attacker is therefore in a position to control the file processed by FFmpeg.
