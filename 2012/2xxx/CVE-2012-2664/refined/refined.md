{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The sosreport utility included the Kickstart configuration file (`/root/anaconda-ks.cfg`) in its output without removing the root user's password.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the sosreport archive could obtain the root user's password, potentially leading to unauthorized system access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Access to sosreport archives"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs access to the sosreport archive. This could involve compromising the system where the report is generated, or intercepting the transfer of the report.",
    "additional_details": "The issue affects all installations, not only those installed via Kickstart. A `/root/anaconda-ks.cfg` file is created by all installation types.\n\nAdditionally, yum repository configuration files in `/etc/yum.repos.d` might contain passwords, particularly in `http_proxy` configurations. The fix automatically removes `http_proxy` passwords, but any passwords embedded within URLs require manual removal or the files must be excluded from the archive."
