| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the BMC Identity Management Suite web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
