Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2393:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the DIAMETER dissector of Wireshark. It involves improper memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper memory allocation within the DIAMETER dissector. This can lead to a crash due to memory corruption or access violations when processing malformed data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact is the potential for Wireshark to crash. This can disrupt network analysis activities, and potentially impact tools that rely on wireshark.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Injection:** An attacker could inject a malformed DIAMETER packet onto the network, which, when captured and processed by Wireshark, would trigger the crash.
*   **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker could convince a user to open a specially crafted packet capture file (.pcap) containing a malformed DIAMETER packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to either inject network traffic or to deliver a malicious packet capture file to a user running a vulnerable version of Wireshark.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Wireshark versions 1.4.0 to 1.4.12, and 1.6.0 to 1.6.7 are affected.

**Fixed Versions:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark versions 1.4.13 and 1.6.8 and later.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing, which is an automated method of testing software by inputting a large amount of malformed or unexpected data.
