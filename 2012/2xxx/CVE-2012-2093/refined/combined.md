Sigh. And this is why people should use mkstemp().

Please use CVE-2012-2093 for this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: gajim insecure file creation when using latex

Hi,
Gajim seems to support latex in instant messages. This is implemented by
dumping the content to a .tex template on disk and converting the result to an
image. To prevent security problems, it is at least checking the input for
dangerous latex commands such as \input (as far as I can see nothing is
missing from this list).

However, it fails to create this temporary file in a secure manner:
From src/common/latex.py:
60 def get_tmpfile_name():
61         random.seed()
62         int_ = random.randint(0, 100)
63         return os.path.join(gettempdir(), 'gajimtex_' + int_.__str__())
...
113 def latex_to_image(str_):
114         result = None
115         exitcode = 0
116
117         try:
118                 bg_str, fg_str = gajim.interface.get_bg_fg_colors()
119         except:
120                 # interface may not be available when we test latext at startup
121                 bg_str, fg_str = 'rgb 1.0 1.0 1.0', 'rgb 0.0 0.0 0.0'
122
123         # filter latex code with bad commands
124         if check_blacklist(str_):
125                 # we triggered the blacklist, immediately return None
126                 return None
127
128         tmpfile = get_tmpfile_name()
130         # build latex string
131         write_latex(os.path.join(tmpfile + '.tex'), str_)
and finally:
65 def write_latex(filename, str_):
66         texstr = '\\documentclass[12pt]{article}\\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}'
67         texstr += '\\usepackage{amsmath}\\usepackage{amssymb}'
68         texstr += '\\pagestyle{empty}'
69         texstr += '\\begin{document}\\begin{large}\\begin{gather*}'
70         texstr += str_
71         texstr += '\\end{gather*}\\end{large}\\end{document}'
72
73         file_ = open(filename, "w+")
74         file_.write(texstr)
75         file_.flush()
76         file_.close()

I think this is of pretty minor severity even though it still allows a local attacker
to overwrite files the victim has write access to with latex content by using symlinks
and latex IMs are used.

Cheers
Nico

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Gajim: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201208-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Gajim, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/gajim** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.15-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.15-r1** |

### Background

Gajim is a Jabber and XMPP client written in PyGTK.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Gajim. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted link
using Gajim, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker could use a specially crafted Jabber ID, possibly
resulting in execution of arbitrary SQL statements.

A local attacker could perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary
