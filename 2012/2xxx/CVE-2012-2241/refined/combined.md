## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)

## Packages

* [devscripts](/security/cves?package=devscripts) - scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier

## Details

Raphael Geissert discovered that the debdiff.pl tool incorrectly handled

shell metacharacters. If a user or automated system were tricked into

processing a specially crafted filename, a remote attacher could possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-0212](/security/CVE-2012-0212))

Raphael Geissert discovered that the dscverify tool incorrectly escaped

arguments to external commands. If a user or automated system were tricked

into processing specially crafted files, a remote attacher could possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-2240](/security/CVE-2012-2240))

Raphael Geissert discovered that the dget tool incorrectly performed input

validation. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing

specially crafted files, a remote attacher could delete arbitrary files.

([CVE-2012-2241](/security/CVE-2012-2241))

Raphael Geissert discovered that the dget tool incorrectly escaped

arguments to external commands. If a user or automated system were tricked

into processing specially crafted files, a remote attacher could possibly

execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2012-2242](/security/CVE-2012-2242))

Jim Meyering discovered that the annotate-output tool incorrectly handled

temporary files. A local attacker could use this flaw to alter files being

processed by the annotate-output tool. On Ubuntu 11.04 and later, this

issue was mitigated by the Yama kernel symlink restrictions.

([CVE-2012-3500](/security/CVE-2012-3500))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2549-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : devscripts
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2240 CVE-2012-2241 CVE-2012-2242 CVE-2012-3500

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in devscripts, a set of
scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier.
The following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ids have
been assigned to identify them:

CVE-2012-2240:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that dscverify does not perform
    sufficient validation and does not properly escape arguments to
    external commands, allowing a remote attacker (as when dscverify is
    used by dget) to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-2241:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that dget allows an attacker to delete
    arbitrary files when processing a specially-crafted .dsc or
    .changes file, due to insuficient input validation.

CVE-2012-2242:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that dget does not properly escape
    arguments to external commands when processing .dsc and .changes
    files, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    This issue is limited with the fix for CVE-2012-2241, and had
    already been fixed in version 2.10.73 due to changes to the code,
    without considering its security implications.

CVE-2012-3500:

    Jim Meyering, Red Hat, discovered that annotate-output determines
    the name of temporary named pipes in a way that allows a local
    attacker to make it abort, leading to denial of service.

Additionally, a regression in the exit code of debdiff introduced in
DSA-2409-1 has been fixed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.10.69+squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.12.3.

We recommend that you upgrade your devscripts packages.
