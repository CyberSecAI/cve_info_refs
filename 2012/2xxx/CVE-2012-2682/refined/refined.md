Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the incomplete support for Unicode in Cumin. Specifically, the application failed to handle non-ASCII characters in link names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Cumin would terminate with an error when trying to display a link name containing non-ASCII characters.
- **Data Inconsistency:** If data with non-ASCII characters was added to the database (via Cumin or Wallaby), subsequent attempts to load this data would fail. The affected page would not be displayed until an administrator cleaned the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A user could cause a DoS by injecting non-ASCII characters into link names.
- Pages containing data with non-ASCII characters would not load, impacting functionality and user experience.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By adding non-ASCII characters to link names via Cumin or Wallaby.
- By adding non-ASCII data directly to the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to modify link names or database entries within the Cumin system, either directly or via other interfaces. This could be an administrator or a user with write access to the data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in RHSA-2014:0858 and RHSA-2014:0859, which provided updated `cumin` packages for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.5.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Stanislav Graf of Red Hat.
- The severity is rated as "Moderate" by Red Hat.
