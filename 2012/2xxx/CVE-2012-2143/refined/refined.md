  "CVE-2012-2143": {
    "description": "The crypt(text, text) function in the pgcrypto contrib module did not handle certain passwords correctly, ignoring characters after the first character which does not fall into the ASCII range.",

      "Password hashing function ignores characters after the 0x80 byte value leading to much weaker than it appeared password."
