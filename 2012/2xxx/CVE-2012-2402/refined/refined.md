Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2402:

**Verification:**

The Debian Security Advisory `DSA-2670-1` explicitly lists `CVE-2012-2402` as one of the vulnerabilities addressed by upgrading the WordPress package. This confirms the relevance of the provided content to the CVE.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The core issue relates to how WordPress handles plugin deactivation, specifically when network-wide plugins are involved. The vulnerability exists when a site administrator could deactivate network-wide plugins under certain conditions.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** A site administrator, who should not have the authority to deactivate network-wide plugins, could do so. This represents a limited privilege escalation.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker, with site administrator privileges, could disable plugins meant to be active across the entire network. This could disrupt the functionality of the WordPress network.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the WordPress admin panel.
    *   The attacker would need to have site administrator level privileges within a WordPress MultiSite install.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would require an account with administrative privileges on a WordPress site within a MultiSite network.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided changeset (20526) reveals the code fix implemented to prevent deactivating already deactivated plugins. This was implemented by filtering the plugins array.
*   The WordPress 3.3.2 release notes mention "Limited privilege escalation where a site administrator could deactivate network-wide plugins when running a WordPress network under particular circumstances." This aligns with the identified vulnerability.
*   The Debian security advisory indicates that the fix for this vulnerability was to upgrade WordPress to the latest upstream version, instead of backporting the patch. This suggests the issue might have required more than just a simple code change and might have involved other related fixes.

**Summary:**

CVE-2012-2402 describes a limited privilege escalation vulnerability within WordPress's MultiSite feature. A site administrator, under specific circumstances, could deactivate plugins that should only be managed by a network administrator. This vulnerability was resolved in WordPress 3.3.2 and by upgrading the Debian package to the same version.
