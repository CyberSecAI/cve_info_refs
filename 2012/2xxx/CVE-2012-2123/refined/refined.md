{
  "CVE-2012-2123": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-269",
      "Description": "When a set user ID (setuid) application is executed, certain personality flags for controlling the application's behavior are cleared. It was found that those flags were not cleared if the application was made privileged via file system capabilities. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to change the behavior of such applications, allowing them to bypass intended restrictions.",
      "Original Description": "It was found that certain personality flags for controlling the application's behavior were not cleared if the application was made privileged via file system capabilities. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to change the behavior of such applications, allowing them to bypass intended restrictions. Note that for default installations, no application shipped by Red Hat for Red Hat Enterprise MRG is made privileged via file system capabilities."
    },
    "Root cause": "The Linux kernel failed to clear certain personality flags when an application gains privileges through file system capabilities (fcaps), which is different from the setuid mechanism.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect permission checks",
      "Information Leak via ASLR"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local, unprivileged users can bypass intended restrictions of privileged applications and potentially make it easier to exploit them.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "File System Capabilities (fcaps)"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to execute a setuid application, and modify its behavior through file system capabilities.",
    "Additional Information": {
      "Details": "The vulnerability allows programs to retain address space layout randomization (ASLR) settings which their parent had tried to disable, which can make exploitation easier.",
      "Fix": "The fix ensures that when a process increases permissions using fcaps, all of the dangerous personality flags which are cleared for setuid apps should also be cleared.",
        "Affected Systems": [
          "Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.1",
	  "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6"
        ],
