drm/radeon: fix load detect on rn50 with hardcoded EDIDs.
commit a09d431f344d854e4fe9cfac44f78cb8202f3eb7 upstream.
When the force changes went in back in 3.3.0, we ended up returning
disconnected in the !force case, and the connected in when forced,
as it hit the hardcoded check.
Fix it so all exits go via the hardcoded check and stop spurious
modesets on platforms with hardcoded EDIDs.

drm/radeon: disable MSI on RV515
commit 16a5e32b83fd946312b9b13590c75d20c95c5202 upstream.
My rv515 card is very flaky with msi enabled. Every so often it loses a rearm
and never comes back, manually banging the rearm brings it back.

drm/radeon/kms: fix the regression of DVI connector check
commit e36325071832f1ba96ac54fb8ba1459f08b05dd8 upstream.
The check of the encoder type in the commit [e00e8b5e: drm/radeon/kms:
fix analog load detection on DVI-I connectors] is obviously wrong, and
it's the culprit of the regression on my workstation with DVI-analog
connection resulting in the blank output.
Fixed the typo now.

futex: Do not leak robust list to unprivileged process
commit bdbb776f882f5ad431aa1e694c69c1c3d6a4a5b8 upstream.
It was possible to extract the robust list head address from a setuid
process if it had used set\_robust\_list(), allowing an ASLR info leak. This
changes the permission checks to be the same as those used for similar
info that comes out of /proc.
Running a setuid program that uses robust futexes would have had:
cred->euid != pcred->euid
cred->euid == pcred->uid
so the old permissions check would allow it. I'm not aware of any setuid
programs that use robust futexes, so this is just a preventative measure.
(This patch is based on changes from grsecurity.)

USB Suspend interrupts occur frequently.
CAUSE:
When it is called pch\_udc\_reconnect() in USB Suspend, it repeats reset and
Suspend.
SOLUTION:
pch\_udc\_reconnect() does not enable all interrupts. When an enumeration event
occurred the driver enables all interrupts.

commit 1c575d2d2e3ff2a7cb3c2e2165064199cfd8ad32 upstream.
ISSUE:
After a USB cable is connect/disconnected, the system rarely freezes.
CAUSE:
Since the USB device controller cannot know to disconnect the USB cable, when
it is used without detecting VBUS by GPIO, the UDC driver does not notify to
USB Gadget.
Since USB Gadget cannot know to disconnect, a false setting occurred when the
USB cable is connected/disconnect repeatedly.

xhci: Fix register save/restore order.
commit c7713e736526d8c9f6f87716fb90562a8ffaff2c upstream.
The xHCI 1.0 spec errata released on June 13, 2011, changes the ordering
that the xHCI registers are saved and restored in. It moves the
interrupt pending (IMAN) and interrupt control (IMOD) registers to be
saved and restored last. I believe that's because the host controller
may attempt to fetch the event ring table when interrupts are
re-enabled. Therefore we need to restore the event ring registers
before we re-enable interrupts.
This should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.37, that contain the

serial: PL011: clear pending interrupts
commit 9b96fbacda34079dea0638ee1e92c56286f6114a upstream.
Chanho Min reported that when the boot loader transfers
control to the kernel, there may be pending interrupts
causing the UART to lock up in an eternal loop trying to
pick tokens from the FIFO (since the RX interrupt flag
indicates there are tokens) while in practice there are
no tokens - in fact there is only a pending IRQ flag.
This patch address the issue with a combination of two
patches suggested by Russell King that clears and mask
all interrupts at probe() and clears any pending error
and RX interrupts at port startup time.
We suspect the spurious interrupts are a side-effect of
switching the UART from FIFO to non-FIFO mode.

memcg: fix Bad page state after replace\_page\_cache
commit 9b7f43afd417a6feb80841d30ced4051c362eb5d upstream.
My 9ce70c0240d0 "memcg: fix deadlock by inverting lrucare nesting" put a
nasty little bug into v3.3's version of mem\_cgroup\_replace\_page\_cache(),
sometimes used for FUSE. Replacing \_\_mem\_cgroup\_commit\_charge\_lrucare()
by \_\_mem\_cgroup\_commit\_charge(), I used the "pc" pointer set up earlier:
but it's for oldpage, and needs now to be for newpage. Once oldpage was
freed, its PageCgroupUsed bit (cleared above but set again here) caused
"Bad page state" messages - and perhaps worse, being missed from newpage.
(I didn't find this by using FUSE, but in reusing the function for tmpfs.)

fix tlb flushing for page table pages
commit cd94154cc6a28dd9dc271042c1a59c08d26da886 upstream.
Git commit 36409f6353fc2d7b6516e631415f938eadd92ffa "use generic RCU
page-table freeing code" introduced a tlb flushing bug. Partially revert
the above git commit and go back to s390 specific page table flush code.
For s390 the TLB can contain three types of entries, "normal" TLB
page-table entries, TLB combined region-and-segment-table (CRST) entries
and real-space entries. Linux does not use real-space entries which
leaves normal TLB entries and CRST entries. The CRST entries are
intermediate steps in the page-table translation called translation paths.
For example a 4K page access in a three-level page table setup will
create two CRST TLB entries and one page-table TLB entry. The advantage
of that approach is that a page access next to the previous one can reuse
the CRST entries and needs just a single read from memory to create the
page-table TLB entry. The disadvantage is that the TLB flushing rules are
more complicated, before any page-table may be freed the TLB needs to be
flushed.
In short: the generic RCU page-table freeing code is incorrect for the
CRST entries, in particular the check for mm\_users < 2 is troublesome.
This is applicable to 3.0+ kernels.

USB: fix bug of device descriptor got from superspeed device
commit d8aec3dbdfd02627e198e7956ab4aaeba2a349fa upstream.
When the Seagate Goflex USB3.0 device is attached to VIA xHCI
host, sometimes the device will downgrade mode to high speed.
By the USB analyzer, I found the device finished the link
training process and worked at superspeed mode. But the device
descriptor got from the device shows the device works at 2.1.
It is very strange and seems like the device controller of
Seagate Goflex has a little confusion.
The first 8 bytes of device descriptor should be:
12 01 00 03 00 00 00 09
But the first 8 bytes of wrong device descriptor are:
12 01 10 02 00 00 00 40
The wrong device descriptor caused the initialization of mass
storage failed. After a while, the device would be recognized
as a high speed device and works fine.
This patch will warm reset the device to fix the issue after
finding the bcdUSB field of device descriptor isn't 0x0300
but the speed mode of device is superspeed.
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, or ones that

xhci: Don't write zeroed pointers to xHC registers.
commit 159e1fcc9a60fc7daba23ee8fcdb99799de3fe84 upstream.
When xhci\_mem\_cleanup() is called, we can't be sure if the xHC is
actually halted. We can ask the xHC to halt by writing to the RUN bit
in the command register, but that might timeout due to a HW hang.
If the host controller is still running, we should not write zeroed
values to the event ring dequeue pointers or base tables, the DCBAA
pointers, or the command ring pointers. Eric Fu reports his VIA VL800
host accesses the event ring pointers after a failed register restore on
resume from suspend. The hypothesis is that the host never actually
halted before the register write to change the event ring pointer to
zero.
Remove all writes of zeroed values to pointer registers in
xhci\_mem\_cleanup(). Instead, make all callers of the function reset the
host controller first, which will reset those registers to zero.
xhci\_mem\_init() is the only caller that doesn't first halt and reset the
host controller before calling xhci\_mem\_cleanup().
This should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.32.

USB: don't ignore suspend errors for root hubs
commit cd4376e23a59a2adf3084cb5f4a523e6d5fd4e49 upstream.
This patch (as1532) fixes a mistake in the USB suspend code. When the
system is going to sleep, we should ignore errors in powering down USB
devices, because they don't really matter. The devices will go to low
power anyway when the entire USB bus gets suspended (except for
SuperSpeed devices; maybe they will need special treatment later).
However we should not ignore errors in suspending root hubs,
especially if the error indicates that the suspend raced with a wakeup
request. Doing so might leave the bus powered on while the system was
supposed to be asleep, or it might cause the suspend of the root hub's
parent controller device to fail, or it might cause a wakeup request
to be ignored.
The patch fixes the problem by ignoring errors only when the device in
question is not a root hub.

USB: don't clear urb->dev in scatter-gather library
commit bcf398537630bf20b4dbe59ba855b69f404c93cf upstream.
This patch (as1517b) fixes an error in the USB scatter-gather library.
The library code uses urb->dev to determine whether or nor an URB is
currently active; the completion handler sets urb->dev to NULL.
However the core unlinking routines need to use urb->dev. Since
unlinking always racing with completion, the completion handler must
not clear urb->dev -- it can lead to invalid memory accesses when a
transfer has to be cancelled.
This patch fixes the problem by getting rid of the lines that clear
urb->dev after urb has been submitted. As a result we may end up
trying to unlink an URB that failed in submission or that has already
completed, so an extra check is added after each unlink to avoid
printing an error message when this happens. The checks are updated
in both sg\_complete() and sg\_cancel(), and the second is updated to
match the first (currently it prints out unnecessary warning messages
if a device is unplugged while a transfer is in progress).

USB: ftdi\_sio: fix race condition in TIOCMIWAIT, and abort of TIOCMIWAIT when the device is removed
commit 876ae50d94b02f3f523aa451b45ec5fb9c25d221 upstream.
There are two issues here, one is that the device is generating
spurious very fast modem status line changes somewhere:
CTS becomes high then low 18µs later:
[121226.924373] ftdi\_process\_packet: prev rng=0 dsr=10 dcd=0 cts=6
[121226.924378] ftdi\_process\_packet: status=10 prev=00 diff=10
[121226.924382] ftdi\_process\_packet: now rng=0 dsr=10 dcd=0 cts=7
(wake\_up\_interruptible is called)
[121226.924391] ftdi\_process\_packet: prev rng=0 dsr=10 dcd=0 cts=7
[121226.924394] ftdi\_process\_packet: status=00 prev=10 diff=10
[121226.924397] ftdi\_process\_packet: now rng=0 dsr=10 dcd=0 cts=8
(wake\_up\_interruptible is called)
This wakes up the task in TIOCMIWAIT:
[121226.924405] ftdi\_ioctl: 19451 rng=0->0 dsr=10->10 dcd=0->0 cts=6->8
(wait from 20:51:46 returns and observes both changes)
Which then calls TIOCMIWAIT again:
20:51:46.400239 ioctl(3, TIOCMIWAIT, 0x20) = 0
22:11:09.441818 ioctl(3, TIOCMGET, [TIOCM\_DTR|TIOCM\_RTS]) = 0
22:11:09.442812 ioctl(3, TIOCMIWAIT, 0x20) = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
(the second wake\_up\_interruptible takes effect and an I/O error occurs)
The other issue is that TIOCMIWAIT will wait forever (unless the task is
interrupted) if the device is removed.
This change removes the -EIO return that occurs if the counts don't
appear to have changed. Multiple counts may have been processed as
one or the waiting task may have started waiting after recording the
current count.
It adds a bool to indicate that the device has been removed so that
TIOCMIWAIT doesn't wait forever, and wakes up any tasks so that they can
return -EIO.

commit fca5430d48d53eaf103498c33fd0d1984b9f448b upstream.

USB: ftdi\_sio.c: Use ftdi async\_icount structure for TIOCMIWAIT, as in other drivers
FTDI\_STATUS\_B0\_MASK does not indicate the changed modem status lines,
it indicates the value of the current modem status lines. An xor is
still required to determine which lines have changed.
The count was only being incremented if the line was high. The only
reason TIOCMIWAIT still worked was because the status packet is
repeated every 1ms, so the count was always changing. The wakeup
itself still ran based on the status lines changing.
This change fixes handling of updates to the modem status lines and
allows multiple processes to use TIOCMIWAIT concurrently.
Tested with two processes waiting on different status lines being
toggled independently.

A call to tty\_open while probe is running may get a reference to the

x86-64 can access the low half of any register, but i386 can only do

but 'q' expresses the constraint properly.

nohz: Fix stale jiffies update in tick\_nohz\_restart()
commit 6f103929f8979d2638e58d7f7fda0beefcb8ee7e upstream.
Fix tick\_nohz\_restart() to not use a stale ktime\_t "now" value when
calling tick\_do\_update\_jiffies64(now).
If we reach this point in the loop it means that we crossed a tick
boundary since we grabbed the "now" timestamp, so at this point "now"
refers to a time in the old jiffy, so using the old value for "now" is
incorrect, and is likely to give us a stale jiffies value.
In particular, the first time through the loop the
tick\_do\_update\_jiffies64(now) call is always a no-op, since the
caller, tick\_nohz\_restart\_sched\_tick(), will have already called
tick\_do\_update\_jiffies64(now) with that "now" value.
Note that tick\_nohz\_stop\_sched\_tick() already uses the correct
approach: when we notice we cross a jiffy boundary, grab a new
timestamp with ktime\_get(), and \*then\* update jiffies.

IB/srpt: Set srq\_type to IB\_SRQT\_BASIC
commit 6f3603367b8f7c34598fdfc1058622e0e1951e98 upstream.
Since commit 96104eda0169 ("RDMA/core: Add SRQ type field"), kernel
users of SRQs need to specify srq\_type = IB\_SRQT\_BASIC in struct
ib\_srq\_init\_attr, or else most low-level drivers will fail in
when srpt\_add\_one() calls ib\_create\_srq() and gets -ENOSYS.
(mlx4\_ib works OK nearly all of the time, because it just needs
srq\_type != IB\_SRQT\_XRC. And apparently nearly everyone using
ib\_srpt is using mlx4 hardware)

perf hists: Catch and handle out-of-date hist entry maps.
commit 63fa471dd49e9c9ce029d910d1024330d9b1b145 upstream.
When a process exec()'s, all the maps are retired, but we keep the hist
entries around which hold references to those outdated maps.
If the same library gets mapped in for which we have hist entries, a new
map will be created. But when we take a perf entry hit within that map,
we'll find the existing hist entry with the older map.
This causes symbol translations to be done incorrectly. For example,
the perf entry processing will lookup the correct uptodate map entry and
use that to calculate the symbol and DSO relative address. But later
when we update the histogram we'll translate the address using the
outdated map file instead leading to conditions such as out-of-range
offsets in symbol\_\_inc\_addr\_samples().
Therefore, update the map of the hist\_entry dynamically at lookup/
creation time.

commit bc67f63650fad6b3478d9ddfd5406d45a95987c9 upstream.
The total number of scatter gather elements in the CISS command
used by the scsi tape code was being cast to a u8, which can hold
at most 255 scatter gather elements. It should have been cast to
a u16. Without this patch the command gets rejected by the controller
since the total scatter gather count did not add up to the right
value resulting in an i/o error.

sparc64: Eliminate obsolete \_\_handle\_softirq() function
commit 3d3eeb2ef26112a200785e5fca58ec58dd33bf1e upstream.
The invocation of softirq is now handled by irq\_exit(), so there is no
need for sparc64 to invoke it on the trap-return path. In fact, doing so
is a bug because if the trap occurred in the idle loop, this invocation
can result in lockdep-RCU failures. The problem is that RCU ignores idle
CPUs, and the sparc64 trap-return path to the softirq handlers fails to
tell RCU that the CPU must be considered non-idle while those handlers
are executing. This means that RCU is ignoring any RCU read-side critical
sections in those handlers, which in turn means that RCU-protected data
can be yanked out from under those read-side critical sections.
The shiny new lockdep-RCU ability to detect RCU read-side critical sections
that RCU is ignoring located this problem.
The fix is straightforward: Make sparc64 stop manually invoking the
softirq handlers.

serial/8250\_pci: add a "force background timer" flag and use it for the "kt" serial port
commit bc02d15a3452fdf9276e8fb89c5e504a88df888a upstream.
Workaround dropped notifications in the iir register. Register reads
coincident with new interrupt notifications sometimes result in this
device clearing the interrupt event without reporting it in the read
data.
The serial core already has a heuristic for determining when a device
has an untrustworthy iir register. In this case when we apriori know
that the iir is faulty use a flag (UPF\_BUG\_THRE) to bypass the test and
force usage of the background timer.

Revert "serial/8250\_pci: setup-quirk workaround for the kt serial controller"
commit 49b532f96fda23663f8be35593d1c1372c0f91e0 upstream.
This reverts commit 448ac154c957c4580531fa0c8f2045816fe2f0e7.
The semantic of UPF\_IIR\_ONCE is only guaranteed to workaround the race
condition in the kt serial's iir register if the only source of
interrupts is THRE (fifo-empty) events. An modem status event at the
wrong time can again cause an iir read to drop the 'empty' status
leading to a hang. So, revert this in preparation for using the
existing "I don't trust my iir register" workaround in the 8250 core
(UART\_BUG\_THRE).

Revert "serial/8250\_pci: init-quirk msi support for kt serial controller"
commit 3579812373aba92b2f3b632bdf99329bc3c05d62 upstream.
This reverts commit e86ff4a63c9fdd875ba8492577cd1ad2252f525c.
This tried to enforce the semantics of one interrupt per iir read of the
THRE (transmit-hold empty) status, but events from other sources
(particularly modem status) defeat this guarantee.
This change also broke 8250\_pci suspend/resume support as
pciserial\_resume\_ports() re-runs .init() quirks, but does not run
.exit() quirks in pciserial\_suspend\_ports() leading to reports like:
sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:16.3/msi\_irqs'
...and a subsequent crash. The mismatch of init/exit at suspend/resume
seems like a bug in its own right.

hugetlb: fix race condition in hugetlb\_fault()
commit 66aebce747eaf9bc456bf1f1b217d8db843031d0 upstream.
The race is as follows:
Suppose a multi-threaded task forks a new process (on cpu A), thus
bumping up the ref count on all the pages. While the fork is occurring
(and thus we have marked all the PTEs as read-only), another thread in
the original process (on cpu B) tries to write to a huge page, taking an
access violation from the write-protect and calling hugetlb\_cow(). Now,
suppose the fork() fails. It will undo the COW and decrement the ref
count on the pages, so the ref count on the huge page drops back to 1.
Meanwhile hugetlb\_cow() also decrements the ref count by one on the
original page, since the original address space doesn't need it any
more, having copied a new page to replace the original page. This
leaves the ref count at zero, and when we call unlock\_page(), we panic.
fork on CPU A fault on CPU B
============= ==============

down\_write\_nested(&child->mmap\_sem);
...

...

...

put\_page(page);
...
fold new\_page into pte
page\_remove\_rmap(page);
put\_page(page);
...
oops ==> unlock\_page(page);
up\_read(&parent->mmap\_sem);
The solution is to take an extra reference to the page while we are
holding the lock on it.

panic: fix stack dump print on direct call to panic()
commit 026ee1f66aaa7f01b617a0ba89ac4b531f9603f1 upstream.
Commit 6e6f0a1f0fa6 ("panic: don't print redundant backtraces on oops")
causes a regression where no stack trace will be printed at all for the
case where kernel code calls panic() directly while not processing an
oops, and of course there are 100's of instances of this type of call.
The original commit executed the check (!oops\_in\_progress), but this will
always be false because just before the dump\_stack() there is a call to
bust\_spinlocks(1), which does the following:
void \_\_attribute\_\_((weak)) bust\_spinlocks(int yes)
{
if (yes) {
++oops\_in\_progress;
The proper way to resolve the problem that original commit tried to
solve is to avoid printing a stack dump from panic() when the either of
the following conditions is true:
1) TAINT\_DIE has been set (this is done by oops\_end())
This indicates and oops has already been printed.
2) oops\_in\_progress > 1
This guards against the rare case where panic() is invoked
a second time, or in between oops\_begin() and oops\_end()

ia64: fix futex\_atomic\_cmpxchg\_inatomic()
commit c76f39bddb84f93f70a5520d9253ec0317bec216 upstream.
Michel Lespinasse cleaned up the futex calling conventions in commit
37a9d912b24f ("futex: Sanitize cmpxchg\_futex\_value\_locked API").
But the ia64 implementation was subtly broken. Gcc does not know that
register "r8" will be updated by the fault handler if the cmpxchg
instruction takes an exception. So it feels safe in letting the
initialization of r8 slide to after the cmpxchg. Result: we always
return 0 whether the user address faulted or not.
Fix by moving the initialization of r8 into the \_\_asm\_\_ code so gcc
won't move it.

Bluetooth: hci\_core: fix NULL-pointer dereference at unregister
commit 94324962066231a938564bebad0f941cd2d06bb2 upstream.
Make sure hci\_dev\_open returns immediately if hci\_dev\_unregister has
been called.
This fixes a race between hci\_dev\_open and hci\_dev\_unregister which can
lead to a NULL-pointer dereference.
Bug is 100% reproducible using hciattach and a disconnected serial port:
0. # hciattach -n /dev/ttyO1 any noflow
1. hci\_dev\_open called from hci\_power\_on grabs req lock
2. hci\_init\_req executes but device fails to initialise (times out
eventually)
3. hci\_dev\_open is called from hci\_sock\_ioctl and sleeps on req lock
4. hci\_uart\_tty\_close calls hci\_dev\_unregister and sleeps on req lock in
hci\_dev\_do\_close
5. hci\_dev\_open (1) releases req lock
6. hci\_dev\_do\_close grabs req lock and returns as device is not up
7. hci\_dev\_unregister sleeps in destroy\_workqueue
8. hci\_dev\_open (3) grabs req lock, calls hci\_init\_req and eventually sleeps
9. hci\_dev\_unregister finishes, while hci\_dev\_open is still running...

Bluetooth: hci\_ldisc: fix NULL-pointer dereference on tty\_close
commit 33b69bf80a3704d45341928e4ff68b6ebd470686 upstream.
Do not close protocol driver until device has been unregistered.
This fixes a race between tty\_close and hci\_dev\_open which can result in
a NULL-pointer dereference.
The line discipline closes the protocol driver while we may still have
hci\_dev\_open sleeping on the req\_lock mutex resulting in a NULL-pointer
dereference when lock is acquired and hci\_init\_req called.
Bug is 100% reproducible using hciattach and a disconnected serial port:
0. # hciattach -n ttyO1 any noflow
1. hci\_dev\_open called from hci\_power\_on grabs req lock
2. hci\_init\_req executes but device fails to initialise (times out
eventually)
3. hci\_dev\_open is called from hci\_sock\_ioctl and sleeps on req lock
4. hci\_uart\_tty\_close detaches protocol driver and cancels init req
5. hci\_dev\_open (1) releases req lock
6. hci\_dev\_open (3) grabs req lock, calls hci\_init\_req, which triggers oops
when request is prepared in hci\_uart\_send\_frame

Bluetooth: uart-ldisc: Fix memory leak
This is a partial, self-contained, minimal backport of commit
797fe796c4335b35d95d5326824513befdb5d1e9 upstream which fixes the memory
leak:
Bluetooth: uart-ldisc: Fix memory leak and remove destruct cb
We currently leak the hci\_uart object if HCI\_UART\_PROTO\_SET is never set
because the hci-destruct callback will then never be called. This fix
removes the hci-destruct callback and frees the driver internal private
hci\_uart object directly on tty-close. We call hci\_unregister\_dev() here
so the hci-core will never call our callbacks again (except destruct).
Therefore, we can safely free the driver internal data right away and
set the destruct callback to NULL.

md/bitmap: prevent bitmap\_daemon\_work running while initialising bitmap
commit afbaa90b80b1ec66e5137cc3824746bfdf559b18 upstream.
If a bitmap is added while the array is active, it is possible
for bitmap\_daemon\_work to run while the bitmap is being
initialised.
This is particularly a problem if bitmap\_daemon\_work sees
bitmap->filemap as non-NULL before it has been filled in properly.
So hold bitmap\_info.mutex while filling in ->filemap
to prevent problems.
This patch is suitable for any -stable kernel, though it might not
apply cleanly before about 3.1.

ARM: 7384/1: ThumbEE: Disable userspace TEEHBR access for !CONFIG\_ARM\_THUMBEE
commit 078c04545ba56da21567728a909a496df5ff730d upstream.
Currently when ThumbEE is not enabled (!CONFIG\_ARM\_THUMBEE) the ThumbEE
register states are not saved/restored at context switch. The default state
of the ThumbEE Ctrl register (TEECR) allows userspace accesses to the
ThumbEE Base Handler register (TEEHBR). This can cause unexpected behaviour
when people use ThumbEE on !CONFIG\_ARM\_THUMBEE kernels, as well as allowing
covert communication - eg between userspace tasks running inside chroot
jails.
This patch sets up TEECR in order to prevent user-space access to TEEHBR
when !CONFIG\_ARM\_THUMBEE. In this case, tasks are sent SIGILL if they try to
access TEEHBR.

rtl8192se used as an AP suffers from "Out of SW-IOMMU space" errors. These
are caused by the DMA buffers used for beacons never being unmapped.

rtlwifi: Preallocate USB read buffers and eliminate kalloc in read routine
commit a7959c1394d4126a70a53b914ce4105f5173d0aa upstream.
The current version of rtlwifi for USB operations uses kmalloc to
acquire a 32-bit buffer for each read of the device. When
\_usb\_read\_sync() is called with the rcu\_lock held, the result is
a "sleeping function called from invalid context" BUG. This is
reported for two cases in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=42775.
The first case has the lock originating from within rtlwifi and could
be fixed by rearranging the locking; however, the second originates from
within mac80211. The kmalloc() call is removed from \_usb\_read\_sync()
by creating a ring buffer pointer in the private area and
allocating the buffer data in the probe routine.

drm/i915: properly compute dp dithering for user-created modes
commit c4867936474183332db4c19791a65fdad6474fd5 upstream.
We've only computed whether we need to fall back to 6bpc due to dp
link bandwidth constrains in mode\_valid, but not mode\_fixup. Under
various circumstances X likes to create new modes which then lack
proper 6bpc flags (if required), resulting in mode\_fixup failures and
ultimately black screens.
Chris Wilson pointed out that we still get things wrong for bpp > 24,
but that should be fixed in another patch (and it'll be easier because
this patch consolidates the logic).
The likely culprit for this regression is

Btrfs: fix regression in scrub path resolving
commit 7a3ae2f8c8c8432e65467b7fc84d5deab04061a0 upstream.
In commit 4692cf58 we introduced new backref walking code for btrfs. This
assumes we're searching live roots, which requires a transaction context.
While scrubbing, however, we must not join a transaction because this could
deadlock with the commit path. Additionally, what scrub really wants to do
is resolving a logical address in the commit root it's currently checking.
This patch adds support for logical to path resolving on commit roots and
makes scrub use that.

Important: kernel-rt security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0670)

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix two security issues and various bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* When a set user ID (setuid) application is executed, certain personality

flags for controlling the application's behavior are cleared (that is, a
privileged application will not be affected by those flags). It was found
that those flags were not cleared if the application was made privileged
via file system capabilities. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to change the behavior of such applications, allowing them to bypass
intended restrictions. Note that for default installations, no application
shipped by Red Hat for Red Hat Enterprise MRG is made privileged via file
system capabilities. (CVE-2012-2123, Important)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's journal\_unmap\_buffer()

function handled buffer head states. On systems that have an ext4 file
system with a journal mounted, a local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2011-4086, Moderate)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN check was missing from the dmesg\_restrict feature.

Consequently, an unprivileged and jailed root user could bypass the
dmesg\_restrict protection. This update adds CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN to both
dmesg\_restrict and kptr\_restrict, which only allows writing to
dmesg\_restrict when root has CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN. (BZ#808271)

* Previously, the \_copy\_from\_pages() function, which is used to copy data

from the temporary buffer to the user-passed buffer, was passed the wrong
size parameter when copying data. Consequently, if the user provided a
buffer greater than PAGE\_SIZE, the getxattr() syscalls were handled
incorrectly. This update fixes \_copy\_from\_pages() to use the ACL length,
which uses a correctly-sized buffer. (BZ#753230)

* Some older versions of hardware or their software could not recognize

certain commands and would log messages for illegal or unsupported errors
the driver could not properly handle. This bug has been fixed and no bogus
error messages are now returned in the described scenario. (BZ#813892)

* Previously, the qla2x00\_poll() function did the local\_irq\_save() call

before calling qla24xx\_intr\_handler(), which had a spinlock. Since
spinlocks are sleepable in the real-time kernel, it is not allowed to call
them with interrupts disabled. This scenario produced error messages and
could cause a system deadlock. With this update, the
local\_irq\_save\_nort(flags) function is used to save flags without disabling
interrupts, which prevents potential deadlocks and removes the error
messages. (BZ#818220)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.
The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

| [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c13)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-20 04:41:48 UTC  ``` Reported by Steve Grubb, if a process increases permissions using fcaps all of the dangerous personality flags which are cleared for suid apps should also be cleared. Thus for example programs given privilege with fcaps will continue to have address space randomization enabled even if the parent tried to disable it to make it easier to attack.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c14)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-20 04:48:10 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/d52fc5dde171f030170a6cb78034d166b13c9445>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c15)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-20 04:51:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, and 5.

But rpm might get upgraded and some package from Fedora becomes a RHEL6 rebase and then we have the problem. Or maybe the software stacks pulls one in. But we still want to fix it.  Fedora 15 is where we started shipping packages that take advantage of the file system based capabilities. And since RHEL7-alpha is an import of F16/17, it certainly has the issue.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c18)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-04-20 04:59:06 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 814523](show_bug.cgi?id=814523 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2123 kernel: fcaps: clear the same personality flags as suid when fcaps are used [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c19)  Kurt Seifried    2012-04-20 04:59:37 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/20/6>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c20)  Josh Boyer    2012-04-20 12:17:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c14)) > Upstream commit: > <http://git.kernel.org/linus/d52fc5dde171f030170a6cb78034d166b13c9445>  You probably also want:  <http://git.kernel.org/linus/51b79bee627d526199b2f6a6bef8ee0c0739b6d1>  to fix a non-x86 build error.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=806722#c21)  Fedora Update System    2012-04-24 04:30:00 UTC  ``` kernel-3.3.2-8.fc17 has been pushed to the Fedora 17 stable repository.

Package        : linux-2.6
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation/denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2011-4086 CVE-2012-0879 CVE-2012-1601 CVE-2012-2123
                 CVE-2012-2133

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-4086

    Eric Sandeen reported an issue in the journaling layer for EXT4 filesystems
    (jbd2). Local users can cause buffers to be accessed after they have been
    torn down, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) due to a system crash.

CVE-2012-0879

    Louis Rilling reported two reference counting issues in the CLONE_IO
    feature of the kernel. Local users can prevent io context structures
    from being freed, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2012-1601

    Michael Ellerman reported an issue in the KVM subsystem. Local users could
    cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by creating VCPUs
    before a call to KVM_CREATE_IRQCHIP.

CVE-2012-2123

    Steve Grubb reported in an issue in fcaps, a filesystem-based capabilities
    system. Personality flags set using this mechanism, such as the disabling
    of address space randomization, may persist across suid calls.

CVE-2012-2133

    Shachar Raindel discovered a use-after-free bug in the hugepages
    quota implementation. Local users with permission to use hugepages
    via the hugetlbfs implementation may be able to cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-44. Updates are currently only available for the amd64, i386 and sparc
ports.

NOTE: Updated linux-2.6 packages will also be made available in the release
of Debian 6.0.5, scheduled to take place the weekend of 2012.05.12. This
pending update will be version 2.6.32-45, and provides an additional fix for
build failures on some architectures. Users for whom this update is not
critical, and who may wish to avoid multiple reboots, should consider waiting
for the 6.0.5 release before updating, or installing the 2.6.32-45 version
ahead of time from proposed-updates.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.32-1um-4+44

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0743)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A local, unprivileged user could use an integer overflow flaw in

drm\_mode\_dirtyfb\_ioctl() to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2012-0044, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the macvtap device driver, used for

creating a bridged network between the guest and the host in KVM
(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) environments. A privileged guest user in a
KVM guest could use this flaw to crash the host. Note: This issue only
affected hosts that have the vhost\_net module loaded with the
experimental\_zcopytx module option enabled (it is not enabled by default),
and that also have macvtap configured for at least one guest.
(CVE-2012-2119, Important)

* When a set user ID (setuid) application is executed, certain personality

flags for controlling the application's behavior are cleared (that is, a
privileged application will not be affected by those flags). It was found
that those flags were not cleared if the application was made privileged
via file system capabilities. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to change the behavior of such applications, allowing them to bypass
intended restrictions. Note that for default installations, no application
shipped by Red Hat for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is made privileged via file
system capabilities. (CVE-2012-2123, Important)

* It was found that the data\_len parameter of the sock\_alloc\_send\_pskb()

function in the Linux kernel's networking implementation was not validated
before use. A privileged guest user in a KVM guest could use this flaw to
crash the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.
(CVE-2012-2136, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the setup\_routing\_entry() function in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel in the way the Message Signaled
Interrupts (MSI) routing entry was handled. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or, possibly, escalate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-2137, Important)

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's memory management

subsystem in the way pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad(), when called with mmap\_sem in
read mode, and Transparent Huge Pages (THP) page faults interacted. A
privileged user in a KVM guest with the ballooning functionality enabled
could potentially use this flaw to crash the host. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-1179, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way device memory was handled during guest device

removal. Upon successful device removal, memory used by the device was not
properly unmapped from the corresponding IOMMU or properly released from
the kernel, leading to a memory leak. A malicious user on a KVM host who
has the ability to assign a device to a guest could use this flaw to crash
the host. (CVE-2012-2121, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)

protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2372, Moderate)

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's memory management

subsystem in the way pmd\_populate() and pte\_offset\_map\_lock() interacted on
32-bit x86 systems with more than 4GB of RAM. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2373, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Chen Haogang for reporting CVE-2012-0044.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

Since spinlocks are sleepable in the real-time kernel, it is not allowed to call them with interrupts disabled. This scenario produced error messages and could cause a system deadlock. With this update, the local\_irq\_save\_nort(flags) function is used to save flags without disabling interrupts, which prevents potential deadlocks and removes the error messages. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2012-05-15 23:09:56 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

Double checked that 3.0.25-rt44.57.el6rt.x86_64.debug provides the backtrace, which still was the issue.  Upgraded to 3.0.30-rt50.62.el6rt.x86_64.debug and this issue is solved.  -> VERIFIED   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=818220#c4)  John Kacur    2012-05-09 20:33:08 UTC  ```      Technical note added.

Since spinlocks are sleepable in the real-time kernel, it is not allowed to call them with interrupts disabled. This scenario produced error messages and could cause a system deadlock.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

fcaps: clear the same personality flags as suid when fcaps are used

```
If a process increases permissions using fcaps all of the dangerous
personality flags which are cleared for suid apps should also be cleared.
Thus programs given priviledge with fcaps will continue to have address space
randomization enabled even if the parent tried to disable it to make it
easier to attack.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=814149#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-04-19 10:10:47 UTC  ``` KVM uses memory slots to track and map guest regions of memory.  When device assignment is used, the pages backing these slots are pinned in memory using get_user_pages and mapped into the iommu.  The problem is that when a memory slot is destroyed the pages for the associated memory slot are neither unpinned nor unmapped from the iommu.  The problem is that those pages are now never unpinned and continue to have an increased reference count. This is therefore a potential page leak from the kvm kernel module.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, local user with ability to assign device (with access to PCI sysfs files for a device) could use this flaw to DoS the system.  With upstream qemu-kvm/kvm privileged guest user that could hotunplug and then hotplug back certain devices could potentially use this flaw to DoS the host.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
