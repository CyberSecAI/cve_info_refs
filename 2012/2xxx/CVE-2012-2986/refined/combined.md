## HP Virtual SAN appliance root shell command injection

#### Vulnerability Note VU#441363

Original Release Date: 2012-08-17 | Last Revised: 2012-08-17

---

### Overview

The HP Virtual SAN appliance version 9.5 is susceptible to a root shell command injection ([CWE-77](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)) vulnerability.

### Description

| Tenable Network Security has reported that HP's fix for the command injection vulnerability, [EDB-ID 18893](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18893/), was incomplete. The ping command for the appliance has a total of four parameters. The initial fix has only sanitized the input for one of the four parameters. Command injection is still possible against the other three parameters. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated attacker can run arbitrary commands on the appliance. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing an HP Virtual SAN appliance using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
