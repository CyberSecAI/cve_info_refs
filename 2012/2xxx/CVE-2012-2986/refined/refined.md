- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HP Virtual SAN appliance's ping command has four parameters, but the initial fix for a command injection vulnerability only sanitized input for one parameter, leaving the other three vulnerable to command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection (CWE-77)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated attacker can run arbitrary commands on the appliance with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is achieved through the ping command's unsanitized parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated to the appliance to exploit this vulnerability.
