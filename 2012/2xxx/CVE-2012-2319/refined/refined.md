{
  "CVE-2012-2319": {
    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflows in the hfsplus filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel allowed local users to gain privileges via a crafted HFS plus filesystem, a related issue to CVE-2009-4020.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the hfsplus filesystem implementation within the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `hfs_bnode_read()` function is called by  `hfsplus_rename_cat()` (in `fs/hfsplus/catalog.c`) and `hfsplus_readdir()` (in `fs/hfsplus/dir.c`) with insufficient validation of data read from the filesystem. This lack of validation can cause a buffer overflow, as the source buffer and length are read from the filesystem without sufficient checks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users with the ability to mount a crafted HFS plus filesystem could exploit this vulnerability to achieve privilege escalation or cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, requiring the ability to mount a specially crafted HFS+ file system image.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local unprivileged user with the ability to mount filesystems is required to exploit this issue."
