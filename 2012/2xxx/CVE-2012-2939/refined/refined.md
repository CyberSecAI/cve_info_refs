Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-2939:

**1.  SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `hid`, `cid`, `id`, and `fid` parameters are vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization, direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries without proper escaping.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to database compromise, data breaches, and application compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts (`holiday.php`, `pages.php`, `holiday_book.php`, `admin/airline-edit.php`, `admin/customer-edit.php`) by manipulating the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to send HTTP requests.
    *   For some SQLi in the admin panel, a privileged user account (moderator, super mod or administrator) is needed.

**2.  Persistent Input Validation Vulnerabilities (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database and later displaying it in the web page. Specifically the 'holiday name' field.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization and output encoding, allowing malicious scripts to be stored in the database and executed when the data is rendered.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious script code that will be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   By injecting malicious scripts in the `holiday name` fields via `holiday_add.php` or `holiday_view.php`.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities**:
    *  Ability to send HTTP requests.
    *  A privileged user account is needed to access the vulnerable modules.

**3.  Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows privileged users to upload files with no checks on their file extension.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper file type validation, insufficient file name sanitization, allows upload of executable file types.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can upload arbitrary files, including web shells (.php, .exe, .asp), enabling them to gain control of the web server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Upload via vulnerable modules such as `airline-edit.php`, `hotel-image-add.php` and `hotel-add.php`
    *   Using a null byte (%00) to bypass extension checks and execute malicious code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   A privileged user account (admin rights) to access the upload modules.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities are in Travelon Express CMS v6.2.2.
*   The exploit was discovered by Vulnerability Research Laboratory.
*   The advisory provides PoC examples for all vulnerabilities.
*   The SQL injection vulnerabilities are rated as "critical," while the other two are rated as medium or medium(-).
*   This report provides more detailed information than the typical CVE description.
