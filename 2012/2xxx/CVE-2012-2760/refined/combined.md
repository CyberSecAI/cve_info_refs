How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Advisory 1201

```
Summary           : Session stealing
Date              : May 2012
Affected versions : all versions prior to mod_auth_openid-0.7
ID                : mod_auth_openid-1201
CVE reference     : CVE-2012-2760

```

# Details

Session ids are stored insecurely in /tmp/mod\_auth\_openid.db (default filename). The db is world readable and the session ids are stored unencrypted.

# Impact

If a user has access to the filesystem on the mod\_auth\_openid server, they can steal all of the current openid authenticated sessions

# Workarounds

A quick improvement of the situation is to chmod 0400 the DB file. Default location is /tmp/mod\_auth\_openid.db unless another location has been configured in AuthOpenIDDBLocation.

# Solution

Upgrade to mod\_auth\_openid-0.7 or later: <http://findingscience.com/mod_auth_openid/releases>

# Credits

This vulnerability was reported by Peter Ellehauge, ptr at groupon dot com. Fixed by Brian Muller bmuller at gmail dot com

# References

# Apache Mod\_Auth\_OpenID - Session Stealing

#### EDB-ID:

**Vulnerable App:**

```
https://github.com/paranoid/mod_auth_openid/blob/master/CVE-2012-2760.markdown

# Security Advisory 1201
    Summary           : Session stealing
    Date              : May 2012
    Affected versions : all versions prior to mod_auth_openid-0.7
    ID                : mod_auth_openid-1201
    CVE reference     : CVE-2012-2760

# Details
Session ids are stored insecurely in /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db (default
filename). The db is world readable and the session ids are stored
unencrypted.

# Impact
If a user has access to the filesystem on the mod_auth_openid server,
they can steal all of the current openid authenticated sessions

# Workarounds
A quick improvement of the situation is to chmod 0400 the DB file.
Default location is /tmp/mod_auth_openid.db unless another location
has been configured in AuthOpenIDDBLocation.

# Solution
Upgrade to mod_auth_openid-0.7 or later:
http://findingscience.com/mod_auth_openid/releases

# Credits
This vulnerability was reported by Peter Ellehauge, ptr at groupon dot
com. Fixed by Brian Muller bmuller at gmail dot com

# References

# History
15 May 2012
Discovered the vulnerability. Created private patch.

16 May 2012
Notified maintainer.
Obtained CVE-id

22 May 2012
Fixed by Brian Muller (bmuller at gmail dot com) in

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
