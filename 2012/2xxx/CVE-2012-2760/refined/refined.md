Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-2760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `mod_auth_openid` module for Apache, prior to version 0.7, stored session IDs in a SQLite database file (`/tmp/mod_auth_openid.db` by default) with world-readable permissions. The session IDs were also stored unencrypted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The SQLite database file containing session IDs had world-readable permissions (644), allowing any local user to read its contents.
*   **Unencrypted Session IDs:** The session IDs within the database were stored in plaintext (unencrypted).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Stealing:** A local attacker with access to the file system of the affected server could read the database file, obtain valid session IDs, and potentially impersonate legitimate users. This allows an attacker to bypass the OpenID authentication for those sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local filesystem access to the server running `mod_auth_openid`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a local user account on the server running the vulnerable `mod_auth_openid` module. This implies that they already have some level of access to the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Peter Ellehauge.
*   The issue was fixed in version 0.7 of `mod_auth_openid` by setting appropriate permissions for the database file.
*   A temporary workaround was to manually set the file permissions to `0400` (read-only for the owner) to restrict access.
*   The vulnerability is considered low severity due to the requirement for local access.
