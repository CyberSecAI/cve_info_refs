## Synel SY-780/A terminal denial-of-service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#154307

Original Release Date: 2012-07-09 | Last Revised: 2012-07-09

---

### Overview

Synel SY-780/A terminals contain a denial-of-service vulnerability when specific ports of the device are scanned.

### Description

| According to Synel's [website](http://www.synel.com/time-and-attendance/sy-780a.html) the SY-780/A terminal is a stand-alone device used for time & attendance monitoring, production floor control, job costing, and access control applications. It has been reported that performing a port or vulnerability scan against this device or specifically hitting ports 1641, 3734 or 3735, will cause the device to stop responding completely. |
| --- |

### Impact

| If an attacker performs a port scan on the SY-780/A terminal, that attacker can completely lock the device, making the device inaccessible. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict network access**  As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. |
