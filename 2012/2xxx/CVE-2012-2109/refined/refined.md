Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the BuddyPress plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data within the WordPress database, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or complete compromise of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-load.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Input:** The malicious SQL code is injected via the `action` parameter, specifically within the `activity_widget_filter` parameter and its associated `page` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable parameter within the POST request.
*  **No Authentication Required:** It appears no authentication is needed to trigger this vulnerability.

**Technical Details**

* The vulnerable parameter is `action=activity_widget_filter&page=1%26exclude%3d1)and(1=0)UNION(SELECT(1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12),(13),(14),(15),(16),(17))%3b--+`.
* This input is passed to the SQL query without proper sanitization allowing for SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in BuddyPress plugin versions prior to 1.5.5.
*   The vulnerability was reported to developers by Ivan Terkin.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.5.5 of the BuddyPress plugin.
