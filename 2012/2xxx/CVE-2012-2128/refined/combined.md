How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL, which once visited by a valid DokuWiki user would lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the context of logged in DokuWiki user.

  Add User appears to be vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) [not verified].

  See<http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2012/Apr/121>

  This is actually the same as [FS#2487](2487.html), the exploit code simply uses the XSS hole to extract a valid CSRF token.

Subject: CVE Request -- DokuWiki: XSS and CSRF due improper escaping of 'target'
 parameter in preprocessing edit form data

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaws were
found in the way DokuWiki, a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, performed
sanitization of the 'target' parameter when preprocessing edit form data. A
remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL, which once visited by a
valid DokuWiki user would lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the
context of logged in DokuWiki user.

Could you allocate a 2012 CVE id for this issue? (one is enough because
only 'target' parameter isn't properly escaped, leading to XSS or CSRF
{see [2] for further examples})

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
