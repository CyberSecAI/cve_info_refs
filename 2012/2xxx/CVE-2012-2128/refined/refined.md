Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2128:

**Verification:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2012-2128, which is identified as a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in DokuWiki due to improper sanitization of the 'target' parameter. This is confirmed by the Red Hat Bugzilla entry (Bug 815122) which explicitly mentions "CVE-2012-2128, CVE-2012-2129 dokuwiki: XSS and CSRF due improper escaping of 'target' parameter...".  The email thread on openwall.com also confirms that CVE-2012-2128 is assigned to the CSRF issue.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `target` parameter in the `/inc/html.php` file when processing edit form data. Specifically, the `$param['target']` variable is printed without filtering in the `html_edit_form` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can exploit the lack of CSRF protection to trick a logged-in DokuWiki user into performing unwanted actions by crafting a malicious link or web page that makes requests to the vulnerable DokuWiki instance.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability also allows for XSS attacks because the unsanitized `target` parameter can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the page when the user views it.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **CSRF:** Successful CSRF attacks can allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, such as creating a new administrative user, modifying content, or changing settings.
    *   **XSS:** Successful XSS attacks can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the DokuWiki site.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker could craft a malicious link or webpage containing a DokuWiki edit request that includes the malicious parameter. When a logged-in user visits this link or page, the CSRF attack will be initiated.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript by using the vulnerable parameter in the URL (e.g., `<http://sitename/doku.php?do=edit&id=S9F8W2A&target=>` `<script>alert(123)</script>`). When a user views the edit page, the injected script will execute.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious links or web pages, then convince a valid DokuWiki user to click or load them.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the XSS issue but needs an authenticated user to click on a malicious link for the CSRF attack to be successful.
    *   The attacker needs access to a publicly accessible DokuWiki instance.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker could add a new user to DokuWiki by combining the XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities. The code first retrieves a CSRF token using XSS and then uses that token to add the user using a POST request.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Khashayar Fereidani from IRCRASH Security Community.
*   Patches for this vulnerability were released for Fedora, and EPEL.

In summary, CVE-2012-2128 highlights a critical CSRF vulnerability in DokuWiki caused by a lack of input validation, with the additional impact of an XSS vulnerability from the same source, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user or execute arbitrary scripts in their browser.
