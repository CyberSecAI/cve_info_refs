Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2186:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks within the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) Originate action. Specifically, the `ExternalIVR` application was not included in the list of applications requiring "system" class authorization. This allowed users with only "originate" class authorization to execute commands that should have required "system" privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The core issue is that the AMI Originate action did not properly restrict the execution of privileged operations.
*   **Bypass of Predefined Checks:** Previous attempts to prevent permission escalation by inspecting the applications passed with the Originate action were inadequate, as the `ExternalIVR` application was overlooked.
*   **Flawed Approach to Security:** The approach of maintaining a predefined list of applications/functions requiring system-level authorization was fundamentally flawed, as it could be bypassed by creative use of the Originate action or specific dialplan configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with "originate" class authorization could execute shell commands on the system hosting Asterisk, thus gaining higher privileges than intended.
*   **Unauthorized System Access:** By escalating privileges, the attacker could potentially compromise the entire system hosting Asterisk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attack is performed remotely through the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI).
*   **Authenticated Sessions:** The attacker must have valid AMI credentials with at least "originate" class authorization.
*   **Abuse of Originate Action:** The attacker leverages the AMI Originate action to execute shell commands through the `ExternalIVR` application (or other bypass methods).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access to Asterisk:** The attacker needs network access to the Asterisk server.
*   **Valid AMI Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid login credentials for the Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI), with "originate" class authorization, but this authorization would not normally allow execution of system commands.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that this particular vulnerability was fixed by adding `ExternalIVR` to the list of applications requiring system authorization. However, it also explicitly states that this approach is inherently flawed and other bypasses may exist, emphasizing that a proper system configuration is necessary to mitigate the risk.
*   The recommended mitigation includes running Asterisk under a defined user with limited permissions, especially if AMI is utilized with accounts that have "originate" class authorization.
*  The advisory also mentions other related advisories (AST-2011-006, AST-2012-004), which highlights that there were ongoing attempts to address similar privilege escalation issues related to AMI Originate action.

This vulnerability allows for a privilege escalation which can lead to an attacker gaining unauthorized shell access on the system running the Asterisk software.
