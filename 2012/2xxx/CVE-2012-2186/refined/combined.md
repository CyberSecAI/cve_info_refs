Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2012-012

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Asterisk Manager User Unauthorized Shell Access |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Permission Escalation |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Authenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Minor |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | July 13, 2012 |
| **Reported By** | Zubair Ashraf of IBM X-Force Research |
| **Posted On** | August 30, 2012 |
| **Last Updated On** | August 30, 2012 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Matt Jordan < mjordan AT digium DOT com > |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2012-2186 |

| **Description** | The AMI Originate action can allow a remote user to specify information that can be used to execute shell commands on the system hosting Asterisk. This can result in an unwanted escalation of permissions, as the Originate action, which requires the âoriginateâ class authorization, can be used to perform actions that would typically require the âsystemâ class authorization. Previous attempts to prevent this permission escalation (AST-2011-006, AST-2012-004) have sought to do so by inspecting the names of applications and functions passed in with the Originate action and, if those applications/functions matched a predefined set of values, rejecting the command if the user lacked the âsystemâ class authorization. As reported by IBM X-Force Research, the âExternalIVRâ application is not listed in the predefined set of values. The solution for this particular vulnerability is to include the âExternalIVRâ application in the set of defined applications/functions that require âsystemâ class authorization.    Unfortunately, the approach of inspecting fields in the Originate action against known applications/functions has a significant flaw. The predefined set of values can be bypassed by creative use of the Originate action or by certain dialplan configurations, which is beyond the ability of Asterisk to analyze at run-time. Attempting to work around these scenarios would result in severely restricting the applications or functions and prevent their usage for legitimate means. As such, any additional security vulnerabilities, where an application/function that would normally require the âsystemâ class authorization can be executed by users with the âoriginateâ class authorization, will not be addressed. Instead, the README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt file has been updated to reflect that the AMI Originate action can result in commands requiring the âsystemâ class authorization to be executed. Proper system configuration can limit the impact of such scenarios.    The next release of each version of Asterisk will contain, in addition to the fix for the âExternalIVRâ application, an updated README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt file. |

| **Resolution** | Asterisk now checks for the âExternalIVRâ application when processing the Originate action.    Additionally, the README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.txt file has been updated. It is highly recommended that, if AMI is utilized with accounts that have the âoriginateâ class authorization, Asterisk is run under a defined user that does not have root permissions. Accounts with the âoriginateâ class authorization should be treated in a similar manner to those with the âsystemâ class authorization. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
