Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a "web parameter tampering problem" within the IBM Rational ClearQuest Web client. This allows a user to manipulate parameters, leading to an elevation of privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Parameter Tampering:** The core weakness is the ability of a user to tamper with web parameters.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful parameter manipulation leads to the user gaining elevated privileges, specifically access to the Site Administration menu.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Site Administration menu, which they normally wouldn't have.
- **System Performance Impact:** Once in the Site Administration menu, the attacker can adjust parameters that can affect the performance of the ClearQuest Web system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack occurs via the ClearQuest Web client.
- **Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates web parameters to elevate their privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid ClearQuest User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the ClearQuest Web client.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs the ability to identify and manipulate web parameters.

**Summary of Key Points**
- This is a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is exploitable by a user that has access to the web interface.
- It allows access to the Site Administration menu, which could result in performance impact.
- The primary vector of attack is through manipulation of web parameters
