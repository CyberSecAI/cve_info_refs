# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0743)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A local, unprivileged user could use an integer overflow flaw in

drm\_mode\_dirtyfb\_ioctl() to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2012-0044, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the macvtap device driver, used for

creating a bridged network between the guest and the host in KVM
(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) environments. A privileged guest user in a
KVM guest could use this flaw to crash the host. Note: This issue only
affected hosts that have the vhost\_net module loaded with the
experimental\_zcopytx module option enabled (it is not enabled by default),
and that also have macvtap configured for at least one guest.
(CVE-2012-2119, Important)

* When a set user ID (setuid) application is executed, certain personality

flags for controlling the application's behavior are cleared (that is, a
privileged application will not be affected by those flags). It was found
that those flags were not cleared if the application was made privileged
via file system capabilities. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to change the behavior of such applications, allowing them to bypass
intended restrictions. Note that for default installations, no application
shipped by Red Hat for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is made privileged via file
system capabilities. (CVE-2012-2123, Important)

* It was found that the data\_len parameter of the sock\_alloc\_send\_pskb()

function in the Linux kernel's networking implementation was not validated
before use. A privileged guest user in a KVM guest could use this flaw to
crash the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.
(CVE-2012-2136, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the setup\_routing\_entry() function in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel in the way the Message Signaled
Interrupts (MSI) routing entry was handled. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or, possibly, escalate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-2137, Important)

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's memory management

subsystem in the way pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad(), when called with mmap\_sem in
read mode, and Transparent Huge Pages (THP) page faults interacted. A
privileged user in a KVM guest with the ballooning functionality enabled
could potentially use this flaw to crash the host. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-1179, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way device memory was handled during guest device

removal. Upon successful device removal, memory used by the device was not
properly unmapped from the corresponding IOMMU or properly released from
the kernel, leading to a memory leak. A malicious user on a KVM host who
has the ability to assign a device to a guest could use this flaw to crash
the host. (CVE-2012-2121, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)

protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2372, Moderate)

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's memory management

subsystem in the way pmd\_populate() and pte\_offset\_map\_lock() interacted on
32-bit x86 systems with more than 4GB of RAM. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2373, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Chen Haogang for reporting CVE-2012-0044.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=816151#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-04-25 11:07:14 UTC  ``` kvm_set_irq() has an internal buffer of three irq routing entries, allowing connecting a GSI to three IRQ chips or on MSI.  However setup_routing_entry() does not properly enforce this, allowing three irqchip routes followed by an MSI route to overflow the buffer.  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentialy escalate their privileges.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=816151#c7)  Petr Matousek    2012-06-05 18:04:05 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. This issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2012:0743 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0743.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=816151#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-18 13:34:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0743 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0743.html>   ``` |  |

# USN-1594-1: Linux kernel (Oneiric backport) vulnerabilities

3 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-backport-oneiric](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-backport-oneiric) - Linux kernel backport from Oneiric

## Details

Vadim Ponomarev discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel causing a reference

leak when PID namespaces are used. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2127](/security/CVE-2012-2127))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual

Machine) subsystem handled MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts). A local

unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or

potentially elevate privileges. ([CVE-2012-2137](/security/CVE-2012-2137))

Mathias Krause discover an error in Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion

Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control Identifier (CCID) use. A local

attack could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) and

potentially escalate privileges if the user can mmap page 0.

([CVE-2013-1827](/security/CVE-2013-1827))

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

# USN-1606-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

11 October 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual

Machine) subsystem handled MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts). A local

unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or

potentially elevate privileges. ([CVE-2012-2137](/security/CVE-2012-2137))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel passed the replacement session

keyring to a child process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). ([CVE-2012-2745](/security/CVE-2012-2745))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

bonding: Manage /proc/net/bonding/ entries from the netdev events
commit a64d49c3dd504b685f9742a2f3dcb11fb8e4345f upstream.
It was recently reported that moving a bonding device between network
namespaces causes warnings from /proc. It turns out after the move we
were trying to add and to remove the /proc/net/bonding entries from the
wrong network namespace.
Move the bonding /proc registration code into the NETDEV\_REGISTER and
NETDEV\_UNREGISTER events where the proc registration and unregistration
will always happen at the right time.

bonding: debugfs and network namespaces are incompatible
commit 96ca7ffe748bf91f851e6aa4479aa11c8b1122ba upstream.
The bonding debugfs support has been broken in the presence of network
namespaces since it has been added. The debugfs support does not handle
multiple bonding devices with the same name in different network
namespaces.
I haven't had any bug reports, and I'm not interested in getting any.
Disable the debugfs support when network namespaces are enabled.

stmmac: Fix for nfs hang on multiple reboot
commit 8e83989106562326bfd6aaf92174fe138efd026b upstream.
It was observed that during multiple reboots nfs hangs. The status of
receive descriptors shows that all the descriptors were in control of
CPU, and none were assigned to DMA.
Also the DMA status register confirmed that the Rx buffer is
unavailable.
This patch adds the fix for the same by adding the memory barriers to
ascertain that the all instructions before enabling the Rx or Tx DMA are
completed which involves the proper setting of the ownership bit in DMA
descriptors.

ACPI / PM: Make acpi\_pm\_device\_sleep\_state() follow the specification
commit dbe9a2edd17d843d80faf2b99f20a691c1853418 upstream.
The comparison between the system sleep state being entered
and the lowest system sleep state the given device may wake up
from in acpi\_pm\_device\_sleep\_state() is reversed, because the
specification (ACPI 5.0) says that for wakeup to work:
"The sleeping state being entered must be less than or equal to the
power state declared in element 1 of the \_PRW object."
In other words, the state returned by \_PRW is the deepest
(lowest-power) system sleep state the device is capable of waking up
the system from.
Moreover, acpi\_pm\_device\_sleep\_state() also should check if the
wakeup capability is supported through ACPI, because in principle it
may be done via native PCIe PME, for example, in which case \_SxW
should not be evaluated.

eCryptfs: Properly check for O\_RDONLY flag before doing privileged open
commit 9fe79d7600497ed8a95c3981cbe5b73ab98222f0 upstream.
If the first attempt at opening the lower file read/write fails,
eCryptfs will retry using a privileged kthread. However, the privileged
retry should not happen if the lower file's inode is read-only because a
read/write open will still be unsuccessful.
The check for determining if the open should be retried was intended to
be based on the access mode of the lower file's open flags being
O\_RDONLY, but the check was incorrectly performed. This would cause the
open to be retried by the privileged kthread, resulting in a second
failed open of the lower file. This patch corrects the check to
determine if the open request should be handled by the privileged
kthread.

eCryptfs: Gracefully refuse miscdev file ops on inherited/passed files
commit 8dc6780587c99286c0d3de747a2946a76989414a upstream.
File operations on /dev/ecryptfs would BUG() when the operations were
performed by processes other than the process that originally opened the
file. This could happen with open files inherited after fork() or file
descriptors passed through IPC mechanisms. Rather than calling BUG(), an
error code can be safely returned in most situations.
In ecryptfs\_miscdev\_release(), eCryptfs still needs to handle the
release even if the last file reference is being held by a process that
didn't originally open the file. ecryptfs\_find\_daemon\_by\_euid() will not
be successful, so a pointer to the daemon is stored in the file's
private\_data. The private\_data pointer is initialized when the miscdev
file is opened and only used when the file is released.

net: remove skb\_orphan\_try()
commit 62b1a8ab9b3660bb820d8dfe23148ed6cda38574 upstream.
Orphaning skb in dev\_hard\_start\_xmit() makes bonding behavior
unfriendly for applications sending big UDP bursts : Once packets
pass the bonding device and come to real device, they might hit a full
qdisc and be dropped. Without orphaning, the sender is automatically
throttled because sk->sk\_wmemalloc reaches sk->sk\_sndbuf (assuming
sk\_sndbuf is not too big)
We could try to defer the orphaning adding another test in
dev\_hard\_start\_xmit(), but all this seems of little gain,
now that BQL tends to make packets more likely to be parked
in Qdisc queues instead of NIC TX ring, in cases where performance
matters.

bnx2x: fix checksum validation

bnx2x driver incorrectly sets ip\_summed to CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY on
encapsulated segments. TCP stack happily accepts frames with bad
checksums, if they are inside a GRE or IPIP encapsulation.
Our understanding is that if no IP or L4 csum validation was done by the
hardware, we should leave ip\_summed as is (CHECKSUM\_NONE), since
hardware doesn't provide CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE support in its cqe.
Then, if IP/L4 checksumming was done by the hardware, set
CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY if no error was flagged.

vhost: don't forget to schedule()
commit d550dda192c1bd039afb774b99485e88b70d7cb8 upstream.
This is a tiny, but important, patch to vhost.
Vhost's worker thread only called schedule() when it had no work to do, and
it wanted to go to sleep. But if there's always work to do, e.g., the guest
is running a network-intensive program like netperf with small message sizes,
schedule() was \*never\* called. This had several negative implications (on
non-preemptive kernels):
1. Passing time was not properly accounted to the "vhost" process (ps and
top would wrongly show it using zero CPU time).
2. Sometimes error messages about RCU timeouts would be printed, if the
core running the vhost thread didn't schedule() for a very long time.
3. Worst of all, a vhost thread would "hog" the core. If several vhost
threads need to share the same core, typically one would get most of the
CPU time (and its associated guest most of the performance), while the
others hardly get any work done.
The trivial solution is to add
if (need\_resched())
schedule();
After doing every piece of work. This will not do the heavy schedule() all
the time, just when the timer interrupt decided a reschedule is warranted
(so need\_resched returns true).

timekeeping: Add missing update call in timekeeping\_resume()
This is a backport of 3e997130bd2e8c6f5aaa49d6e3161d4d29b43ab0
The leap second rework unearthed another issue of inconsistent data.
On timekeeping\_resume() the timekeeper data is updated, but nothing
calls timekeeping\_update(), so now the update code in the timer
interrupt sees stale values.
This has been the case before those changes, but then the timer
interrupt was using stale data as well so this went unnoticed for quite
some time.
Add the missing update call, so all the data is consistent everywhere.

hrtimer: Update hrtimer base offsets each hrtimer\_interrupt
commit 5baefd6d84163443215f4a99f6a20f054ef11236 upstream.
The update of the hrtimer base offsets on all cpus cannot be made
atomically from the timekeeper.lock held and interrupt disabled region
as smp function calls are not allowed there.
clock\_was\_set(), which enforces the update on all cpus, is called
either from preemptible process context in case of do\_settimeofday()
or from the softirq context when the offset modification happened in
the timer interrupt itself due to a leap second.
In both cases there is a race window for an hrtimer interrupt between
dropping timekeeper lock, enabling interrupts and clock\_was\_set()
issuing the updates. Any interrupt which arrives in that window will
see the new time but operate on stale offsets.
So we need to make sure that an hrtimer interrupt always sees a
consistent state of time and offsets.
ktime\_get\_update\_offsets() allows us to get the current monotonic time
and update the per cpu hrtimer base offsets from hrtimer\_interrupt()
to capture a consistent state of monotonic time and the offsets. The
function replaces the existing ktime\_get() calls in hrtimer\_interrupt().
The overhead of the new function vs. ktime\_get() is minimal as it just
adds two store operations.
This ensures that any changes to realtime or boottime offsets are
noticed and stored into the per-cpu hrtimer base structures, prior to
any hrtimer expiration and guarantees that timers are not expired early.

timekeeping: Provide hrtimer update function
This is a backport of f6c06abfb3972ad4914cef57d8348fcb2932bc3b
To finally fix the infamous leap second issue and other race windows
caused by functions which change the offsets between the various time
bases (CLOCK\_MONOTONIC, CLOCK\_REALTIME and CLOCK\_BOOTTIME) we need a
function which atomically gets the current monotonic time and updates
the offsets of CLOCK\_REALTIME and CLOCK\_BOOTTIME with minimalistic
overhead. The previous patch which provides ktime\_t offsets allows us
to make this function almost as cheap as ktime\_get() which is going to
be replaced in hrtimer\_interrupt().

timekeeping: Fix leapsecond triggered load spike issue
This is a backport of 4873fa070ae84a4115f0b3c9dfabc224f1bc7c51
The timekeeping code misses an update of the hrtimer subsystem after a
leap second happened. Due to that timers based on CLOCK\_REALTIME are
either expiring a second early or late depending on whether a leap
second has been inserted or deleted until an operation is initiated
which causes that update. Unless the update happens by some other
means this discrepancy between the timekeeping and the hrtimer data
stays forever and timers are expired either early or late.
The reported immediate workaround - $ data -s "`date`" - is causing a
call to clock\_was\_set() which updates the hrtimer data structures.
See: http://www.sheeri.com/content/mysql-and-leap-second-high-cpu-and-fix
Add the missing clock\_was\_set() call to update\_wall\_time() in case of
a leap second event. The actual update is deferred to softirq context
as the necessary smp function call cannot be invoked from hard
interrupt context.

clock\_was\_set() cannot be called from hard interrupt context because

does the timekeeping updates.
Provide a new function which denotes it in the hrtimer cpu base
structure of the cpu on which it is called and raise the hrtimer
softirq. We then execute the clock\_was\_set() notificiation from
softirq context in run\_hrtimer\_softirq(). The hrtimer softirq is
rarely used, so polling the flag there is not a performance issue.

ntp: Correct TAI offset during leap second
commit dd48d708ff3e917f6d6b6c2b696c3f18c019feed upstream.
When repeating a UTC time value during a leap second (when the UTC
time should be 23:59:60), the TAI timescale should not stop. The kernel
NTP code increments the TAI offset one second too late. This patch fixes
the issue by incrementing the offset during the leap second itself.

ntp: Fix leap-second hrtimer livelock
This is a backport of 6b43ae8a619d17c4935c3320d2ef9e92bdeed05d
This should have been backported when it was commited, but I
mistook the problem as requiring the ntp\_lock changes
that landed in 3.4 in order for it to occur.
Unfortunately the same issue can happen (with only one cpu)
as follows:
do\_adjtimex()
write\_seqlock\_irq(&xtime\_lock);
process\_adjtimex\_modes()
process\_adj\_status()
ntp\_start\_leap\_timer()
hrtimer\_start()
hrtimer\_reprogram()
tick\_program\_event()
clockevents\_program\_event()
ktime\_get()
seq = req\_seqbegin(xtime\_lock); [DEADLOCK]
This deadlock will no always occur, as it requires the
leap\_timer to force a hrtimer\_reprogram which only happens
if its set and there's no sooner timer to expire.
NOTE: This patch, being faithful to the original commit,
introduces a bug (we don't update wall\_to\_monotonic),
which will be resovled by backporting a following fix.
Original commit message below:
Since commit 7dffa3c673fbcf835cd7be80bb4aec8ad3f51168 the ntp
subsystem has used an hrtimer for triggering the leapsecond
adjustment. However, this can cause a potential livelock.
Thomas diagnosed this as the following pattern:
CPU 0 CPU 1
do\_adjtimex()
spin\_lock\_irq(&ntp\_lock);
process\_adjtimex\_modes(); timer\_interrupt()
process\_adj\_status(); do\_timer()
ntp\_start\_leap\_timer(); write\_lock(&xtime\_lock);
hrtimer\_start(); update\_wall\_time();
hrtimer\_reprogram(); ntp\_tick\_length()
tick\_program\_event() spin\_lock(&ntp\_lock);
clockevents\_program\_event()
ktime\_get()
seq = req\_seqbegin(xtime\_lock);
This patch tries to avoid the problem by reverting back to not using
an hrtimer to inject leapseconds, and instead we handle the leapsecond
processing in the second\_overflow() function.
The downside to this change is that on systems that support highres
timers, the leap second processing will occur on a HZ tick boundary,
(ie: ~1-10ms, depending on HZ) after the leap second instead of
possibly sooner (~34us in my tests w/ x86\_64 lapic).
This patch applies on top of tip/timers/core.

dm raid1: set discard\_zeroes\_data\_unsupported
commit 7c8d3a42fe1c58a7e8fd3f6a013e7d7b474ff931 upstream.
We can't guarantee that REQ\_DISCARD on dm-mirror zeroes the data even if
the underlying disks support zero on discard. So this patch sets
ti->discard\_zeroes\_data\_unsupported.
For example, if the mirror is in the process of resynchronizing, it may
happen that kcopyd reads a piece of data, then discard is sent on the
same area and then kcopyd writes the piece of data to another leg.
Consequently, the data is not zeroed.
The flag was made available by commit 983c7db347db8ce2d8453fd1d89b7a4bb6920d56
(dm crypt: always disable discard\_zeroes\_data).

dm raid1: fix crash with mirror recovery and discard
commit 751f188dd5ab95b3f2b5f2f467c38aae5a2877eb upstream.
This patch fixes a crash when a discard request is sent during mirror
recovery.
Firstly, some background. Generally, the following sequence happens during
mirror synchronization:
- function do\_recovery is called
- do\_recovery calls dm\_rh\_recovery\_prepare
- dm\_rh\_recovery\_prepare uses a semaphore to limit the number
simultaneously recovered regions (by default the semaphore value is 1,
so only one region at a time is recovered)
- dm\_rh\_recovery\_prepare calls \_\_rh\_recovery\_prepare,
\_\_rh\_recovery\_prepare asks the log driver for the next region to
recover. Then, it sets the region state to DM\_RH\_RECOVERING. If there
are no pending I/Os on this region, the region is added to
quiesced\_regions list. If there are pending I/Os, the region is not
added to any list. It is added to the quiesced\_regions list later (by
dm\_rh\_dec function) when all I/Os finish.
- when the region is on quiesced\_regions list, there are no I/Os in
flight on this region. The region is popped from the list in
dm\_rh\_recovery\_start function. Then, a kcopyd job is started in the
recover function.
- when the kcopyd job finishes, recovery\_complete is called. It calls
dm\_rh\_recovery\_end. dm\_rh\_recovery\_end adds the region to
recovered\_regions or failed\_recovered\_regions list (depending on
whether the copy operation was successful or not).
The above mechanism assumes that if the region is in DM\_RH\_RECOVERING
state, no new I/Os are started on this region. When I/O is started,
dm\_rh\_inc\_pending is called, which increases reg->pending count. When
I/O is finished, dm\_rh\_dec is called. It decreases reg->pending count.
If the count is zero and the region was in DM\_RH\_RECOVERING state,
dm\_rh\_dec adds it to the quiesced\_regions list.
Consequently, if we call dm\_rh\_inc\_pending/dm\_rh\_dec while the region is
in DM\_RH\_RECOVERING state, it could be added to quiesced\_regions list
multiple times or it could be added to this list when kcopyd is copying
data (it is assumed that the region is not on any list while kcopyd does
its jobs). This results in memory corruption and crash.
There already exist bypasses for REQ\_FLUSH requests: REQ\_FLUSH requests
do not belong to any region, so they are always added to the sync list
in do\_writes. dm\_rh\_inc\_pending does not increase count for REQ\_FLUSH
requests. In mirror\_end\_io, dm\_rh\_dec is never called for REQ\_FLUSH
requests. These bypasses avoid the crash possibility described above.
These bypasses were improperly implemented for REQ\_DISCARD when
the mirror target gained discard support in commit
5fc2ffeabb9ee0fc0e71ff16b49f34f0ed3d05b4 (dm raid1: support discard).
In do\_writes, REQ\_DISCARD requests is always added to the sync queue and
immediately dispatched (even if the region is in DM\_RH\_RECOVERING). However,
dm\_rh\_inc and dm\_rh\_dec is called for REQ\_DISCARD resusts. So it violates the
rule that no I/Os are started on DM\_RH\_RECOVERING regions, and causes the list
corruption described above.
This patch changes it so that REQ\_DISCARD requests follow the same path
as REQ\_FLUSH. This avoids the crash.

pnfs-obj: Fix \_\_r4w\_get\_page when offset is beyond i\_size
commit c999ff68029ebd0f56ccae75444f640f6d5a27d2 upstream.
It is very common for the end of the file to be unaligned on
stripe size. But since we know it's beyond file's end then
the XOR should be preformed with all zeros.
Old code used to just read zeros out of the OSD devices, which is a great
waist. But what scares me more about this situation is that, we now have
pages attached to the file's mapping that are beyond i\_size. I don't
like the kind of bugs this calls for.
Fix both birds, by returning a global zero\_page, if offset is beyond
i\_size.
TODO:
Change the API to ->\_\_r4w\_get\_page() so a NULL can be
returned without being considered as error, since XOR API
treats NULL entries as zero\_pages.

ore: Fix NFS crash by supporting any unaligned RAID IO
commit 9ff19309a9623f2963ac5a136782ea4d8b5d67fb upstream.
In RAID\_5/6 We used to not permit an IO that it's end
byte is not stripe\_size aligned and spans more than one stripe.
.i.e the caller must check if after submission the actual
transferred bytes is shorter, and would need to resubmit
a new IO with the remainder.
Exofs supports this, and NFS was supposed to support this
as well with it's short write mechanism. But late testing has
exposed a CRASH when this is used with none-RPC layout-drivers.
The change at NFS is deep and risky, in it's place the fix
at ORE to lift the limitation is actually clean and simple.
So here it is below.
The principal here is that in the case of unaligned IO on
both ends, beginning and end, we will send two read requests
one like old code, before the calculation of the first stripe,
and also a new site, before the calculation of the last stripe.
If any "boundary" is aligned or the complete IO is within a single
stripe. we do a single read like before.
The code is clean and simple by splitting the old \_read\_4\_write
into 3 even parts:
1.\_read\_4\_write\_first\_stripe
2. \_read\_4\_write\_last\_stripe
3. \_read\_4\_write\_execute
And calling 1+3 at the same place as before. 2+3 before last
stripe, and in the case of all in a single stripe then 1+2+3
is preformed additively.
Why did I not think of it before. Well I had a strike of
genius because I have stared at this code for 2 years, and did
not find this simple solution, til today. Not that I did not try.
This solution is much better for NFS than the previous supposedly
solution because the short write was dealt with out-of-band after
IO\_done, which would cause for a seeky IO pattern where as in here
we execute in order. At both solutions we do 2 separate reads, only
here we do it within a single IO request. (And actually combine two
writes into a single submission)
NFS/exofs code need not change since the ORE API communicates the new
shorter length on return, what will happen is that this case would not
occur anymore.
hurray!!

UBIFS: fix a bug in empty space fix-up
commit c6727932cfdb13501108b16c38463c09d5ec7a74 upstream.
UBIFS has a feature called "empty space fix-up" which is a quirk to work-around
limitations of dumb flasher programs. Namely, of those flashers that are unable
to skip NAND pages full of 0xFFs while flashing, resulting in empty space at
the end of half-filled eraseblocks to be unusable for UBIFS. This feature is
relatively new (introduced in v3.0).
The fix-up routine (fixup\_free\_space()) is executed only once at the very first
mount if the superblock has the 'space\_fixup' flag set (can be done with -F
option of mkfs.ubifs). It basically reads all the UBIFS data and metadata and
writes it back to the same LEB. The routine assumes the image is pristine and
does not have anything in the journal.
There was a bug in 'fixup\_free\_space()' where it fixed up the log incorrectly.
All but one LEB of the log of a pristine file-system are empty. And one
contains just a commit start node. And 'fixup\_free\_space()' just unmapped this
LEB, which resulted in wiping the commit start node. As a result, some users
were unable to mount the file-system next time with the following symptom:
UBIFS error (pid 1): replay\_log\_leb: first log node at LEB 3:0 is not CS node
UBIFS error (pid 1): replay\_log\_leb: log error detected while replaying the log at LEB 3:0
The root-cause of this bug was that 'fixup\_free\_space()' wrongly assumed
that the beginning of empty space in the log head (c->lhead\_offs) was known
on mount. However, it is not the case - it was always 0. UBIFS does not store
in it the master node and finds out by scanning the log on every mount.
The fix is simple - just pass commit start node size instead of 0 to
'fixup\_leb()'.

md: avoid crash when stopping md array races with closing other open fds.
commit a05b7ea03d72f36edb0cec05e8893803335c61a0 upstream.
md will refuse to stop an array if any other fd (or mounted fs) is
using it.
When any fs is unmounted of when the last open fd is closed all
pending IO will be flushed (e.g. sync\_blockdev call in \_\_blkdev\_put)
so there will be no pending IO to worry about when the array is
stopped.
However in order to send the STOP\_ARRAY ioctl to stop the array one
must first get and open fd on the block device.
If some fd is being used to write to the block device and it is closed
after mdadm open the block device, but before mdadm issues the
STOP\_ARRAY ioctl, then there will be no last-close on the md device so
\_\_blkdev\_put will not call sync\_blockdev.
If this happens, then IO can still be in-flight while md tears down
the array and bad things can happen (use-after-free and subsequent
havoc).
So in the case where do\_md\_stop is being called from an open file
descriptor, call sync\_block after taking the mutex to ensure there
will be no new openers.
This is needed when setting a read-write device to read-only too.

mm: fix lost kswapd wakeup in kswapd\_stop()
commit 1c7e7f6c0703d03af6bcd5ccc11fc15d23e5ecbe upstream.
Offlining memory may block forever, waiting for kswapd() to wake up
because kswapd() does not check the event kthread->should\_stop before
sleeping.
The proper pattern, from Documentation/memory-barriers.txt, is:
--- waker ---
event\_indicated = 1;
wake\_up\_process(event\_daemon);
--- sleeper ---
for (;;) {
set\_current\_state(TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
if (event\_indicated)
break;
schedule();
}
set\_current\_state() may be wrapped by:
prepare\_to\_wait();
In the kswapd() case, event\_indicated is kthread->should\_stop.
=== offlining memory (waker) ===
kswapd\_stop()
kthread\_stop()
kthread->should\_stop = 1
wake\_up\_process()
wait\_for\_completion()
=== kswapd\_try\_to\_sleep (sleeper) ===
kswapd\_try\_to\_sleep()
prepare\_to\_wait()
.
.
schedule()
.
.
finish\_wait()
The schedule() needs to be protected by a test of kthread->should\_stop,
which is wrapped by kthread\_should\_stop().

cifs: on CONFIG\_HIGHMEM machines, limit the rsize/wsize to the kmap space
commit 3ae629d98bd5ed77585a878566f04f310adbc591 upstream.
We currently rely on being able to kmap all of the pages in an async
read or write request. If you're on a machine that has CONFIG\_HIGHMEM
set then that kmap space is limited, sometimes to as low as 512 slots.
With 512 slots, we can only support up to a 2M r/wsize, and that's
assuming that we can get our greedy little hands on all of them. There
are other users however, so it's possible we'll end up stuck with a
size that large.
Since we can't handle a rsize or wsize larger than that currently, cap
those options at the number of kmap slots we have. We could consider
capping it even lower, but we currently default to a max of 1M. Might as
well allow those luddites on 32 bit arches enough rope to hang
themselves.
A more robust fix would be to teach the send and receive routines how
to contend with an array of pages so we don't need to marshal up a kvec
array at all. That's a fairly significant overhaul though, so we'll need
this limit in place until that's ready.

fifo: Do not restart open() if it already found a partner
commit 05d290d66be6ef77a0b962ebecf01911bd984a78 upstream.
If a parent and child process open the two ends of a fifo, and the
child immediately exits, the parent may receive a SIGCHLD before its
open() returns. In that case, we need to make sure that open() will
return successfully after the SIGCHLD handler returns, instead of
throwing EINTR or being restarted. Otherwise, the restarted open()
would incorrectly wait for a second partner on the other end.
The following test demonstrates the EINTR that was wrongly thrown from
the parent’s open(). Change .sa\_flags = 0 to .sa\_flags = SA\_RESTART
to see a deadlock instead, in which the restarted open() waits for a
second reader that will never come. (On my systems, this happens
pretty reliably within about 5 to 500 iterations. Others report that
it manages to loop ~forever sometimes; YMMV.)

tcm\_fc: Fix crash seen with aborts and large reads
commit 3cc5d2a6b9a2fd1bf024aa5e52dd22961eecaf13 upstream.
This patch fixes a crash seen when large reads have their exchange
aborted by either timing out or being reset. Because the exchange
abort results in the seq pointer being set to NULL, because the
sequence is no longer valid, it must not be dereferenced. This
patch changes the function ft\_get\_task\_tag to return ~0 if it is
unable to get the tag for this reason. Because the get\_task\_tag
interface provides no means of returning an error, this seems
like the best way to fix this issue at the moment.

e1000e: Correct link check logic for 82571 serdes
commit d0efa8f23a644f7cb7d1f8e78dd9a223efa412a3 upstream.
SYNCH bit and IV bit of RXCW register are sticky. Before examining these bits,
RXCW should be read twice to filter out one-time false events and have correct
values for these bits. Incorrect values of these bits in link check logic can
cause weird link stability issues if auto-negotiation fails.

iwlegacy: don't mess up the SCD when removing a key
commit b48d96652626b315229b1b82c6270eead6a77a6d upstream.
When we remove a key, we put a key index which was supposed
to tell the fw that we are actually removing the key. But
instead the fw took that index as a valid index and messed
up the SRAM of the device.
This memory corruption on the device mangled the data of
the SCD. The impact on the user is that SCD queue 2 got
stuck after having removed keys.

iwlwifi: always monitor for stuck queues
If we only monitor while associated, the following
can happen:
- we're associated, and the queue stuck check
runs, setting the queue "touch" time to X
- we disassociate, stopping the monitoring,
which leaves the time set to X
- almost 2s later, we associate, and enqueue
a frame
- before the frame is transmitted, we monitor
for stuck queues, and find the time set to
X, although it is now later than X + 2000ms,
so we decide that the queue is stuck and
erroneously restart the device

rt2x00usb: fix indexes ordering on RX queue kick
commit efd821182cec8c92babef6e00a95066d3252fda4 upstream.
On rt2x00\_dmastart() we increase index specified by Q\_INDEX and on
rt2x00\_dmadone() we increase index specified by Q\_INDEX\_DONE. So entries
between Q\_INDEX\_DONE and Q\_INDEX are those we currently process in the
hardware. Entries between Q\_INDEX and Q\_INDEX\_DONE are those we can
submit to the hardware.
According to that fix rt2x00usb\_kick\_queue(), as we need to submit RX
entries that are not processed by the hardware. It worked before only
for empty queue, otherwise was broken.
Note that for TX queues indexes ordering are ok. We need to kick entries
that have filled skb, but was not submitted to the hardware, i.e.
started from Q\_INDEX\_DONE and have ENTRY\_DATA\_PENDING bit set.
From practical standpoint this fixes RX queue stall, usually reproducible
in AP mode, like for example reported here:

failed allocations.
2. Do not check the amount of free pages left on every single page
write, but wait until one map is completely populated and then check.
3. Set maximum number of pages for read buffering consistently, instead
of inadvertently depending on the size of the sector type.
4. Fix copyright line, which I missed when I submitted the hibernation
threading patch.
5. Dispense with bit shifting arithmetic to improve readability.
6. Really recalculate the number of pages required to be free after all
allocations have been done.

block: fix infinite loop in \_\_getblk\_slow
commit 91f68c89d8f35fe98ea04159b9a3b42d0149478f upstream.
Commit 080399aaaf35 ("block: don't mark buffers beyond end of disk as
mapped") exposed a bug in \_\_getblk\_slow that causes mount to hang as it
loops infinitely waiting for a buffer that lies beyond the end of the
disk to become uptodate.
The problem was initially reported by Torsten Hilbrich here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/6/18/54
and also reported independently here:
http://www.sysresccd.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4511
and then Richard W.M. Jones and Marcos Mello noted a few separate
bugzillas also associated with the same issue. This patch has been
confirmed to fix:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=835019
The main problem is here, in \_\_getblk\_slow:
for (;;) {
struct buffer\_head \* bh;
int ret;
bh = \_\_find\_get\_block(bdev, block, size);
if (bh)
return bh;
ret = grow\_buffers(bdev, block, size);
if (ret < 0)
return NULL;
if (ret == 0)
free\_more\_memory();
}
\_\_find\_get\_block does not find the block, since it will not be marked as
mapped, and so grow\_buffers is called to fill in the buffers for the
associated page. I believe the for (;;) loop is there primarily to
retry in the case of memory pressure keeping grow\_buffers from
succeeding. However, we also continue to loop for other cases, like the
block lying beond the end of the disk. So, the fix I came up with is to
only loop when grow\_buffers fails due to memory allocation issues
(return value of 0).
The attached patch was tested by myself, Torsten, and Rich, and was
found to resolve the problem in call cases.

Commit d640113fe80e45ebd4a5b420b introduced a regression on SMP
systems where the processor core with ACPI id zero is disabled

The regression got spread through stable kernels.
On 3.0.X it got introduced via 3.0.18.
Such platforms may be rare, but do exist.
Look out for a disabled processor with acpi\_id 0 in dmesg:
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi\_id[0x00] lapic\_id[0x10] disabled)

2. mmap the file and write to it
3. read the file can't get the correct value
Because
sys\_read() -> generic\_file\_aio\_read() -> simple\_readpage() -> clear\_page()
which causes the page to be zeroed.

mm, thp: abort compaction if migration page cannot be charged to memcg
commit 4bf2bba3750f10aa9e62e6949bc7e8329990f01b upstream.
If page migration cannot charge the temporary page to the memcg,
migrate\_pages() will return -ENOMEM. This isn't considered in memory
compaction however, and the loop continues to iterate over all
pageblocks trying to isolate and migrate pages. If a small number of
very large memcgs happen to be oom, however, these attempts will mostly
be futile leading to an enormous amout of cpu consumption due to the
page migration failures.
This patch will short circuit and fail memory compaction if
migrate\_pages() returns -ENOMEM. COMPACT\_PARTIAL is returned in case
some migrations were successful so that the page allocator will retry.

memory hotplug: fix invalid memory access caused by stale kswapd pointer
commit d8adde17e5f858427504725218c56aef90e90fc7 upstream.
kswapd\_stop() is called to destroy the kswapd work thread when all memory
of a NUMA node has been offlined. But kswapd\_stop() only terminates the
work thread without resetting NODE\_DATA(nid)->kswapd to NULL. The stale
pointer will prevent kswapd\_run() from creating a new work thread when
adding memory to the memory-less NUMA node again. Eventually the stale
pointer may cause invalid memory access.
An example stack dump as below. It's reproduced with 2.6.32, but latest
kernel has the same issue.

PCI: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS computers
commit dbf0e4c7257f8d684ec1a3c919853464293de66e upstream.
Quite a few ASUS computers experience a nasty problem, related to the
EHCI controllers, when going into system suspend. It was observed
that the problem didn't occur if the controllers were not put into the
D3 power state before starting the suspend, and commit
151b61284776be2d6f02d48c23c3625678960b97 (USB: EHCI: fix crash during
suspend on ASUS computers) was created to do this.
It turned out this approach messed up other computers that didn't have
the problem -- it prevented USB wakeup from working. Consequently
commit c2fb8a3fa25513de8fedb38509b1f15a5bbee47b (USB: add
NO\_D3\_DURING\_SLEEP flag and revert 151b61284776be2) was merged; it
reverted the earlier commit and added a whitelist of known good board
names.
Now we know the actual cause of the problem. Thanks to AceLan Kao for
tracking it down.
According to him, an engineer at ASUS explained that some of their
BIOSes contain a bug that was added in an attempt to work around a
problem in early versions of Windows. When the computer goes into S3
suspend, the BIOS tries to verify that the EHCI controllers were first
quiesced by the OS. Nothing's wrong with this, but the BIOS does it
by checking that the PCI COMMAND registers contain 0 without checking
the controllers' power state. If the register isn't 0, the BIOS
assumes the controller needs to be quiesced and tries to do so. This
involves making various MMIO accesses to the controller, which don't
work very well if the controller is already in D3. The end result is
a system hang or memory corruption.
Since the value in the PCI COMMAND register doesn't matter once the
controller has been suspended, and since the value will be restored
anyway when the controller is resumed, we can work around the BIOS bug
simply by setting the register to 0 during system suspend. This patch
(as1590) does so and also reverts the second commit mentioned above,
which is now unnecessary.
In theory we could do this for every PCI device. However to avoid
introducing new problems, the patch restricts itself to EHCI host
controllers.
Finally the affected systems can suspend with USB wakeup working
properly.

md/raid1: fix use-after-free bug in RAID1 data-check code.
commit 2d4f4f3384d4ef4f7c571448e803a1ce721113d5 upstream.
This bug has been present ever since data-check was introduce
in 2.6.16. However it would only fire if a data-check were
done on a degraded array, which was only possible if the array
has 3 or more devices. This is certainly possible, but is quite
uncommon.
Since hot-replace was added in 3.3 it can happen more often as
the same condition can arise if not all possible replacements are
present.
The problem is that as soon as we submit the last read request, the
'r1\_bio' structure could be freed at any time, so we really should
stop looking at it. If the last device is being read from we will
stop looking at it. However if the last device is not due to be read
from, we will still check the bio pointer in the r1\_bio, but the
r1\_bio might already be free.
So use the read\_targets counter to make sure we stop looking for bios
to submit as soon as we have submitted them all.
This fix is suitable for any -stable kernel since 2.6.16.

libsas: fix taskfile corruption in sas\_ata\_qc\_fill\_rtf
commit 6ef1b512f4e6f936d89aa20be3d97a7ec7c290ac upstream.
fill\_result\_tf() grabs the taskfile flags from the originating qc which
sas\_ata\_qc\_fill\_rtf() promptly overwrites. The presence of an
ata\_taskfile in the sata\_device makes it tempting to just copy the full
contents in sas\_ata\_qc\_fill\_rtf(). However, libata really only wants
the fis contents and expects the other portions of the taskfile to not
be touched by ->qc\_fill\_rtf. To that end store a fis buffer in the
sata\_device and use ata\_tf\_from\_fis() like every other ->qc\_fill\_rtf()
implementation.

hwspinlock/core: use global ID to register hwspinlocks on multiple devices
commit 476a7eeb60e70ddab138e7cb4bc44ef5ac20782e upstream.
Commit 300bab9770 (hwspinlock/core: register a bank of hwspinlocks in a
single API call, 2011-09-06) introduced 'hwspin\_lock\_register\_single()'
to register numerous (a bank of) hwspinlock instances in a single API,
'hwspin\_lock\_register()'.
At which time, 'hwspin\_lock\_register()' accidentally passes 'local IDs'
to 'hwspin\_lock\_register\_single()', despite that ...\_single() requires
'global IDs' to register hwspinlocks.
We have to convert into global IDs by supplying the missing 'base\_id'.

mtd: nandsim: don't open code a do\_div helper
commit 596fd46268634082314b3af1ded4612e1b7f3f03 upstream.
We don't need to open code the divide function, just use div\_u64 that
already exists and do the same job. While this is a straightforward
clean up, there is more to that, the real motivation for this.
While building on a cross compiling environment in armel, using gcc
4.6.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5), I was getting the following build
error:
ERROR: "\_\_aeabi\_uldivmod" [drivers/mtd/nand/nandsim.ko] undefined!
After investigating with objdump and hand built assembly version
generated with the compiler, I narrowed \_\_aeabi\_uldivmod as being
generated from the divide function. When nandsim.c is built with
-fno-inline-functions-called-once, that happens when
CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SECTION\_MISMATCH is enabled, the do\_div optimization in
arch/arm/include/asm/div64.h doesn't work as expected with the open
coded divide function: even if the do\_div we are using doesn't have a
constant divisor, the compiler still includes the else parts of the
optimized do\_div macro, and translates the divisions there to use
\_\_aeabi\_uldivmod, instead of only calling \_\_do\_div\_asm -> \_\_do\_div64 and
optimizing/removing everything else out.
So to reproduce, gcc 4.6 plus CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SECTION\_MISMATCH=y and
CONFIG\_MTD\_NAND\_NANDSIM=m should do it, building on armel.
After this change, the compiler does the intended thing even with
-fno-inline-functions-called-once, and optimizes out as expected the
constant handling in the optimized do\_div on arm. As this also avoids a
build issue, I'm marking for Stable, as I think is applicable for this
case.

The WDM\_READ flag is normally cleared by wdm\_int\_callback
before resubmitting the read urb, and set by wdm\_in\_callback
when this urb returns with data or an error. But a crashing
device may cause both a read error and cancelling all urbs.
Make sure that the flag is cleared by wdm\_read if the buffer
is empty.
We don't clear the flag on errors, as there may be pending
data in the buffer which should be processed. The flag will
instead be cleared on the next wdm\_read call.

Thanks to Charles Wang for spotting the defects in the current code:
- If we go idle during the sample window -- after sampling, we get a
negative bias because we can negate our own sample.
- If we wake up during the sample window we get a positive bias
because we push the sample to a known active period.
So rewrite the entire nohz load-avg muck once again, now adding
copious documentation to the code.

usb: Add support for root hub port status CAS
commit 8bea2bd37df08aaa599aa361a9f8b836ba98e554 upstream.
The host controller port status register supports CAS (Cold Attach
Status) bit. This bit could be set when USB3.0 device is connected
when system is in Sx state. When the system wakes to S0 this port
status with CAS bit is reported and this port can't be used by any
device.
When CAS bit is set the port should be reset by warm reset. This
was not supported by xhci driver.
The issue was found when pendrive was connected to suspended
platform. The link state of "Compliance Mode" was reported together
with CAS bit. This link state was also not supported by xhci and
core/hub.c.
The CAS bit is defined only for xhci root hub port and it is
not supported on regular hubs. The link status is used to force
warm reset on port. Make the USB core issue a warm reset when port
is in ether the 'inactive' or 'compliance mode'. Change the xHCI driver
to report 'compliance mode' when the CAS is set. This force warm reset
on the root hub port.
This patch should be backported to stable kernels as old as 3.2, that
contain the commit 10d674a82e553cb8a1f41027bb3c3e309b3f6804 "USB: When

iommu/amd: Initialize dma\_ops for hotplug and sriov devices
commit ac1534a55d1e87d59a21c09c570605933b551480 upstream.
When a device is added to the system at runtime the AMD
IOMMU driver initializes the necessary data structures to
handle translation for it. But it forgets to change the
per-device dma\_ops to point to the AMD IOMMU driver. So
mapping actually never happens and all DMA accesses end in
an IO\_PAGE\_FAULT. Fix this.

scsi: Silence unnecessary warnings about ioctl to partition
commit 6d9359280753d2955f86d6411047516a9431eb51 upstream.
Sometimes, warnings about ioctls to partition happen often enough that they
form majority of the warnings in the kernel log and users complain. In some
cases warnings are about ioctls such as SG\_IO so it's not good to get rid of
the warnings completely as they can ease debugging of userspace problems
when ioctl is refused.
Since I have seen warnings from lots of commands, including some proprietary
userspace applications, I don't think disallowing the ioctls for processes
with CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO will happen in the near future if ever. So lets just
stop warning for processes with CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO for which ioctl is allowed.

kvm\_set\_irq() has an internal buffer of three irq routing entries, allowing

does not properly enforce this, allowing three irqchip routes followed by
an MSI route to overflow the buffer.

hugepages: fix use after free bug in "quota" handling
commit 90481622d75715bfcb68501280a917dbfe516029 upstream.
hugetlbfs\_{get,put}\_quota() are badly named. They don't interact with the
general quota handling code, and they don't much resemble its behaviour.
Rather than being about maintaining limits on on-disk block usage by
particular users, they are instead about maintaining limits on in-memory
page usage (including anonymous MAP\_PRIVATE copied-on-write pages)
associated with a particular hugetlbfs filesystem instance.
Worse, they work by having callbacks to the hugetlbfs filesystem code from
the low-level page handling code, in particular from free\_huge\_page().
This is a layering violation of itself, but more importantly, if the
kernel does a get\_user\_pages() on hugepages (which can happen from KVM
amongst others), then the free\_huge\_page() can be delayed until after the
associated inode has already been freed. If an unmount occurs at the
wrong time, even the hugetlbfs superblock where the "quota" limits are
stored may have been freed.
Andrew Barry proposed a patch to fix this by having hugepages, instead of
storing a pointer to their address\_space and reaching the superblock from
there, had the hugepages store pointers directly to the superblock,
bumping the reference count as appropriate to avoid it being freed.
Andrew Morton rejected that version, however, on the grounds that it made
the existing layering violation worse.
This is a reworked version of Andrew's patch, which removes the extra, and
some of the existing, layering violation. It works by introducing the
concept of a hugepage "subpool" at the lower hugepage mm layer - that is a
finite logical pool of hugepages to allocate from. hugetlbfs now creates
a subpool for each filesystem instance with a page limit set, and a
pointer to the subpool gets added to each allocated hugepage, instead of
the address\_space pointer used now. The subpool has its own lifetime and
is only freed once all pages in it \_and\_ all other references to it (i.e.
superblocks) are gone.
subpools are optional - a NULL subpool pointer is taken by the code to
mean that no subpool limits are in effect.
Previous discussion of this bug found in: "Fix refcounting in hugetlbfs
quota handling.". See: https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/8/11/28 or
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=126928970510627&w=1
v2: Fixed a bug spotted by Hillf Danton, and removed the extra parameter to
alloc\_huge\_page() - since it already takes the vma, it is not necessary.

kbuild: do not check for ancient modutils tools
commit 620c231c7a7f48745094727bb612f6321cfc8844 upstream.
scripts/depmod.sh checks for the output of '-V' expecting that it has
module-init-tools in it. It's a hack to prevent users from using
modutils instead of module-init-tools, that only works with 2.4.x
kernels. This however prints an annoying warning for kmod tool, that is
currently replacing module-init-tools.
Rather than putting another check for kmod's version, just remove it
since users of 2.4.x kernel are unlikely to upgrade to 3.x, and if they
do, let depmod fail in that case because they should know what they are
doing.

drm/i915: do not enable RC6p on Sandy Bridge
commit 1c8ecf80fdee4e7b23a9e7da7ff9bd59ba2dcf96 upstream.
With base on latest findings, RC6p seems to be respondible for RC6-related
issues on Sandy Bridge platform. To work-around those issues, the previous
solution was to completely disable RC6 on Sandy Bridge for the past few
releases, even if plain RC6 was not giving any issues.
What this patch does is preventing RC6p from being enabled on Sandy Bridge
even if users enable RC6 via a kernel parameter. So it won't change the
defaults in any way, but will ensure that if users do enable RC6 manually
it won't break their machines by enabling this extra state.
Proper fix for this (enabling specific RC6 states according to the GPU
generation) were proposed for the -next kernel, but we are too late in the
release process now to pick such changes.

Also remove every log output until we know that we have a SABI interface

Keeping a whitelist of laptop with a model granularity is something that can't

# USN-1529-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

10 August 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's macvtap device driver, which is

used in KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) to create a network bridge

between host and guest. A privleged user in a guest could exploit this flaw

to crash the host, if the vhost\_net module is loaded with the

experimental\_zcopytx option enabled. ([CVE-2012-2119](/security/CVE-2012-2119))

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel's network TUN/TAP device

implementation. A local user with access to the TUN/TAP interface (which is

not available to unprivileged users until granted by a root user) could

exploit this flaw to crash the system or potential gain administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2012-2136](/security/CVE-2012-2136))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual

Machine) subsystem handled MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts). A local

unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or

potentially elevate privileges. ([CVE-2012-2137](/security/CVE-2012-2137))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)

protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2372](/security/CVE-2012-2372))

Ulrich Obergfell discovered an error in the Linux kernel's memory

management subsystem on 32 bit PAE systems with more than 4GB of memory

installed. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to crash the

system. ([CVE-2012-2373](/security/CVE-2012-2373))

It was discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the Linux

kernel, was not correctly validating the origin on Netlink messages. An

untrusted local user can cause a denial of service of Linux guests in

Hyper-V virtualization environments. ([CVE-2012-2669](/security/CVE-2012-2669))

Dan Rosenberg discovered flaws in the Linux kernel's NCI (Near Field

Communication Controller Interface). A remote attacker could exploit these

flaws to crash the system or potentially execute privileged code.

([CVE-2012-3364](/security/CVE-2012-3364))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's epoll system call. An

unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.

([CVE-2012-3375](/security/CVE-2012-3375))

Some errors where discovered in the Linux kernel's UDF file system, which

is used to mount some CD-ROMs and DVDs. An unprivileged local user could

use these flaws to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-3400](/security/CVE-2012-3400))

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel's memory

subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a

denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-3511](/security/CVE-2012-3511))

Denys Fedoryshchenko discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's TCP receive

processing for IPv4. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (kernel resource consumption) via a flood of SYN+FIN TCP

packets. ([CVE-2012-6638](/security/CVE-2012-6638))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=816151#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-04-25 11:07:14 UTC  ``` kvm_set_irq() has an internal buffer of three irq routing entries, allowing connecting a GSI to three IRQ chips or on MSI.  However setup_routing_entry() does not properly enforce this, allowing three irqchip routes followed by an MSI route to overflow the buffer.  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentialy escalate their privileges.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=816151#c7)  Petr Matousek    2012-06-05 18:04:05 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. This issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2012:0743 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0743.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=816151#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-18 13:34:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0743 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0743.html>   ``` |  |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Vadim Ponomarev discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel causing a reference

leak when PID namespaces are used. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2127](/security/CVE-2012-2127))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual

Machine) subsystem handled MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts). A local

unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or

potentially elevate privileges. ([CVE-2012-2137](/security/CVE-2012-2137))

Mathias Krause discover an error in Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion

Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control Identifier (CCID) use. A local

attack could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) and

potentially escalate privileges if the user can mmap page 0.
