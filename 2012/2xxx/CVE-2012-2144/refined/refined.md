Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2144:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a session fixation vulnerability in the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon). The application did not properly regenerate or invalidate session identifiers upon user login and logout, allowing an attacker to potentially hijack a user's session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The primary vulnerability is that Horizon was susceptible to session fixation attacks.  An attacker could set a session ID in a user's browser and if the user logged into the application, the attacker could then use that session id to gain access to the user's account.
*   **Session Reuse/Leakage:** There were also circumstances where user data or authentication information could potentially leak between different user sessions if proper session invalidation was not handled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to a user's Horizon account, potentially allowing them to view sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** User data and authentication information could leak from one session to another.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker may gain unauthorized capabilities by logging into an admin user's session. For example, an attacker could potentially change an admin user's password.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Session Fixation:** An attacker could pre-set a user's session cookie before the user logs into Horizon, and then use the same session cookie to gain access to the application as the user.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although not directly the cause, XSS could have been used to set the session cookie.
*  **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker could intercept and modify HTTP traffic to inject a session cookie. This could be achieved via an attack on public WiFi.
*   **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to the user's machine could manipulate the browser's session cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the user's browser session cookies, either directly, or through an XSS attack, MITM attack, or physical access to the user's machine.
*   The attacker needs to know or manipulate the target user into authenticating to the Horizon application, before or after setting the cookie.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the way Horizon handled session management within its middleware and authentication process.
*   The fix involved modifying Horizon to use Django's built-in authentication mechanisms properly, including rotating session keys upon login.
*   The fix ensures that a new, empty session is created if an existing session corresponds to a different authenticated user.
*   The patch also included changes to properly clear and rotate sessions when a user logs out.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was initially suspected to be a Django issue, but was later confirmed to be a Horizon-specific bug.
*   The fix was backported to the Essex release and incorporated into the Folsom release of OpenStack.
*   The patch involved changes to `horizon/exceptions.py`, `horizon/middleware.py`, `horizon/tests/auth_tests.py`, `horizon/users.py`, `horizon/views/auth.py`, and `horizon/views/auth_forms.py`.
* There were reports of test failures when applying the patch to an Ubuntu environment using Django 1.3, which were later resolved.
* The vulnerability affects all versions of Horizon prior to the fix.
