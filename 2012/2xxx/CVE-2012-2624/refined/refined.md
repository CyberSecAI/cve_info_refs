- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Hotscan Listener interface fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input. Specifically, a crafted font file sent over the TCP interface can cause a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service (crash) due to a stack buffer overrun. The service crash can stop all swift processes, thus increasing the impact. While the overflow is only two bytes, and code execution is mitigated by NXCOMPAT, the service crash can impact the swift process.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious input, specifically a crafted font file, to the Hotscan listener TCP interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to the Hotscan listener interface via the network.
