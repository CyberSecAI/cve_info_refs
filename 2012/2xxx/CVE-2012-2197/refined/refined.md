Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow within the Java stored procedure infrastructure of IBM DB2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow occurs when data written to a buffer exceeds the buffer's allocated memory space. This can lead to overwriting adjacent memory regions. In this case, the overflow occurs on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This is typically a severe vulnerability as it allows attackers complete control over the compromised machine.
*   **Denial of Service:** Stack buffer overflows can sometimes lead to application crashes, resulting in denial of service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, code execution can often be leveraged for privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to gain higher privileges within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Java Stored Procedure Infrastructure:** The vulnerability is within the Java Stored Procedure infrastructure, meaning that attackers would need to use functionality in this infrastructure to trigger the overflow.
*   **Remote:**  The description of the vulnerability as a remote vulnerability indicates that the attacker can exploit it over a network, likely through an interface exposed by DB2, like an SQL interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected DB2 instance.
*   **DB2 User Credentials:** While the provided information doesn't explicitly say so, it's plausible that the attacker would need to have valid DB2 user credentials or be able to use other vulnerabilities to get access in order to execute the vulnerable Java stored procedures.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker must have the technical ability to craft input that exploits the stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java stored procedure infrastructure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in DB2 V9.1 Fix Pack 12, and corresponding fix packs for DB2 versions 9.5, 9.7, 9.8, and 10.1.
*   The specific Security APAR associated with the fix is IC84555.
*   The provided Secunia content doesn't offer specific details on this CVE beyond indicating Secunia's vulnerability research capabilities.
