{
  "CVE-2012-2672": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw in Mojarra, where the FacesContext that is made available during application startup is held in a ThreadLocal, and the reference is not properly cleaned up in all cases.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper cleanup of ThreadLocal reference leading to context leakage"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could use this flaw to access another WAR's resources using a crafted, deployed application. Another WAR can get access to the leftover context and thus get access to the other WAR's resources.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access using a crafted application",
      "Deployed web application with malicious intent"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to deploy a web application on the same JBoss instance as the target application."
  }
