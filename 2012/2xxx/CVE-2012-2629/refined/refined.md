Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-2629:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **CSRF:** The application lacks anti-CSRF tokens, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.
*   **Persistent XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and executed when other users view the affected content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities exist due to the absence of anti-CSRF tokens. This allows an attacker to perform actions on the application by tricking an authenticated user into submitting malicious requests.
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple persistent XSS vulnerabilities exist in various input fields due to improper input sanitization. The vulnerable parameters include:
    *   `page_title` (admin/content_pages_edit.php)
    *   `category_name[1]` (admin/products_category.php)
    *   `site_name`, `seo_title`, and `meta_keywords` (admin/settings_siteinfo.php)
    *   `company_name`, `address1`, `address2`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `author_first_name`, `author_last_name`, `author_email`, etc. (admin/settings_company.php)
    *   `system_email`, `sender_name`, `smtp_server`, `smtp_username`, `smtp_password`, and `order_notice_email` (admin/settings_email.php)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker can add a new administrator account or modify other application parameters by tricking an authenticated admin into visiting a crafted webpage.
*   **Persistent XSS:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users, which includes other administrators and unauthenticated users. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Account compromise
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the application

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker crafts a malicious webpage containing a form that automatically submits a request to the vulnerable application. The attacker then tricks an authenticated admin into visiting this malicious webpage.
*   **Persistent XSS:** An attacker, typically an authenticated administrator, injects malicious JavaScript code into input fields. This payload is stored in the database, and then the malicious script is executed when other users view the affected data or pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious webpage and convince an authenticated user (typically an administrator) to visit it.
*   **Persistent XSS:**
    *   For injecting XSS, the attacker typically needs to have admin access to the application to modify vulnerable input parameters.
    *   For the XSS to be triggered, any other user accessing the infected parts of the application is affected.
