Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2804:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content includes a message in a mailing list thread discussing multiple CVEs fixed in FFmpeg 0.11, and CVE-2012-2804 is explicitly mentioned in the list. The content is therefore relevant to CVE-2012-2804.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided text from `ubuntu.com` says:
    > It was discovered that Libav incorrectly handled certain malformed media files.
This implies that the root cause of the vulnerability is improper input validation or handling within Libav when processing malformed media files.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness lies in Libav's processing logic, specifically how it handles malformed media files. This can lead to application crashes or arbitrary code execution if certain malformed data is not handled correctly.

*  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of service:** An attacker can cause the application to crash by providing a malicious media file, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.
    *   **Arbitrary code execution:** A more severe impact, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected program.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening or processing a specially crafted media file. This could occur in scenarios where FFmpeg or Libav is used to process media files from untrusted sources.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to create a malformed media file and then deliver it to a user in a way that makes the user's application (using the vulnerable Libav/FFmpeg version) process it.  The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious file to a user who will then trigger the vulnerability by attempting to decode the file using vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The email from Michael Niedermayer confirms that git commit hashes for the fixes have been added to the ffmpeg security page. This is further information not found in the original CVE description which is helpful for developers looking for the specific fixes in the code.
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-1705-1) confirms that the vulnerability exists in the `libav` package.

This analysis provides a more detailed explanation than the official CVE description (which is a placeholder), by providing the root cause of the vulnerability, impact of exploitation, and attack vectors.
