How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**LibreOffice is a privacy-oriented office suite that runs on your own computer and doesn’t include AI features out-of-the-box. But we know that many users are interested in combining AI tools with the suite, so we talked to John Balis who is working on a (fully optional!)

**Dione Maddern** and The Documentation Team are proud to announce the immediate availability of the **LibreOffice Calc Guide 24.8**, an update of the existing Calc Guide 24.2 with enhancements taken from the current LibreOffice 24.8 Calc module.

[![Calc Guide 24.8](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CoverCalc248-724x1024.png)](http://books.libreoffice.org)

The book was reviewed for clarity, readability and content additions, notably the **Calc database table referencing in formulas**, removal of deprecated JavaScript debugger and refactoring of the Calc’s chart topic – in which the chapter on charts was split in two, one for the chart basics and the second for the chart types.…

# LibreOffice: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in LibreOffice, allowing
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/libreoffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.5.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.5.5.3** |

| Package | **app-office/libreoffice-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.5.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.5.5.3** |

### Background

LibreOffice is a full office productivity suite.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in LibreOffice:

* The Microsoft Word Document parser contains an out-of-bounds read
  error (CVE-2011-2713).
* The Raptor RDF parser contains an XML External Entity expansion error
  (CVE-2012-0037).
* The graphic loading parser contains an integer overflow error which
  could cause a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2012-1149).
* Multiple errors in the XML manifest handling code could cause a
  heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2665).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document file using LibreOffice, possibly resulting in execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service
condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LibreOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-3.5.5.3"

```

All users of the LibreOffice binary package should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-3.5.5.3"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-05-29 14:30:28 UTC  ``` Multiple heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the XML manifest encryption handling code of OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice:  1) Previously it was not checked if the particular tag was contained within expected parent tag, leading to possibility of child tag handler being able to write its data into different (than expected) parent handler sequence, leading to heap buffer overflow,  2) also a fixed size sequence was allocated to record properties of a particular XML tag, associated with XML element. By duplicating certain tags in XML manifest it was possible to write past the heap-based buffer bounds,  3) yet, the Base64 decoder implementation incorrectly assumed the length of ChecksumAttribute (input buffer) to be evenly divisible by 4, leading into the storage for output (Base64 decoded) buffer to be underallocated, resulting into heap buffer overflow.  A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted Open Document Text (.odt) file, that when opened would cause OpenOffice.org / LibreOffice to crash or, potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running a tool from the suite.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-05-29 14:45:37 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the openoffice.org package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the libreoffice package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-01 15:10:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 588505](attachment.cgi?id=588505 "Proposed patches from Caolan McNamara for all three issues") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=588505&action=edit "Proposed patches from Caolan McNamara for all three issues") Proposed patches from Caolan McNamara for all three issues   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-01 16:07:30 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-2665](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2665) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-03 16:29:43 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Upstream acknowledges Timo Warns as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c13)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-01 15:09:08 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://www.libreoffice.org/advisories/CVE-2012-2665/>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-01 19:35:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1136 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1136.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-01 19:46:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1135 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1135.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c16)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-01 20:26:42 UTC  ``` Created libreoffice tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 845119](show_bug.cgi?id=845119 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2665 openoffice.org, libreoffice: Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the XML manifest encryption handling code [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c17)  Fedora Update System    2012-08-10 22:37:02 UTC  ``` libreoffice-3.4.5.2-18.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

# USN-1537-1: OpenOffice.org vulnerability

13 August 2012

OpenOffice.org could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [openoffice.org](/security/cves?package=openoffice.org) - Office productivity suite

## Details

It was discovered that OpenOffice.org incorrectly handled certain

encryption tags in Open Document Text (.odt) files. If a user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could cause

OpenOffice.org to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [openoffice.org-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openoffice.org)
  -
  [1:3.2.0-7ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openoffice.org/1%3A3.2.0-7ubuntu4.4)

After a standard system update you need to restart OpenOffice.org to make

all the necessary changes.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Important: libreoffice security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1135)

## Topic

Updated libreoffice packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

## Description

LibreOffice is an open source, community-developed office productivity
suite. It includes the key desktop applications, such as a word processor,
spreadsheet application, presentation manager, formula editor, and a
drawing program.

Multiple heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way LibreOffice
processed encryption information in the manifest files of OpenDocument
Format files. An attacker could provide a specially-crafted OpenDocument
Format file that, when opened in a LibreOffice application, would cause the
application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-2665)

Upstream acknowledges Timo Warns as the original reporter of these issues.

All LibreOffice users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
instances of LibreOffice applications must be restarted for this update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-05-29 14:30:28 UTC  ``` Multiple heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the XML manifest encryption handling code of OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice:  1) Previously it was not checked if the particular tag was contained within expected parent tag, leading to possibility of child tag handler being able to write its data into different (than expected) parent handler sequence, leading to heap buffer overflow,  2) also a fixed size sequence was allocated to record properties of a particular XML tag, associated with XML element. By duplicating certain tags in XML manifest it was possible to write past the heap-based buffer bounds,  3) yet, the Base64 decoder implementation incorrectly assumed the length of ChecksumAttribute (input buffer) to be evenly divisible by 4, leading into the storage for output (Base64 decoded) buffer to be underallocated, resulting into heap buffer overflow.  A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted Open Document Text (.odt) file, that when opened would cause OpenOffice.org / LibreOffice to crash or, potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running a tool from the suite.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-05-29 14:45:37 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the openoffice.org package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the libreoffice package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-01 15:10:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 588505](attachment.cgi?id=588505 "Proposed patches from Caolan McNamara for all three issues") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=588505&action=edit "Proposed patches from Caolan McNamara for all three issues") Proposed patches from Caolan McNamara for all three issues   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-01 16:07:30 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-2665](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2665) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-03 16:29:43 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Upstream acknowledges Timo Warns as the original reporter of this issue.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c13)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-01 15:09:08 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://www.libreoffice.org/advisories/CVE-2012-2665/>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-01 19:35:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1136 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1136.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-01 19:46:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1135 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1135.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c16)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-01 20:26:42 UTC  ``` Created libreoffice tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 845119](show_bug.cgi?id=845119 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2665 openoffice.org, libreoffice: Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the XML manifest encryption handling code [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=826077#c17)  Fedora Update System    2012-08-10 22:37:02 UTC  ``` libreoffice-3.4.5.2-18.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.

# USN-1536-1: LibreOffice vulnerability

13 August 2012

LibreOffice could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)

## Packages

* [libreoffice](/security/cves?package=libreoffice) - Office productivity suite

## Details

It was discovered that LibreOffice incorrectly handled certain encryption

tags in Open Document Text (.odt) files. If a user were tricked into

opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could cause LibreOffice to

crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program.

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libreoffice-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice)
  -
  [1:3.5.4-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice/1%3A3.5.4-0ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [libreoffice-core](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice)
  -
  [1:3.4.4-0ubuntu1.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice/1%3A3.4.4-0ubuntu1.4)

  -
  [1:3.3.4-0ubuntu1.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/libreoffice/1%3A3.3.4-0ubuntu1.4)

After a standard system update you need to restart LibreOffice to make all

the necessary changes.

| Affected versions | < **4.2.5.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.5.2** |

### Background

OpenOffice is the open source version of StarOffice, a full office
productivity suite. LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice and
Libreoffice. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
using OpenOffice, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition, execution
of arbitrary Python code, authentication bypass, or reading and writing
of arbitrary files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-3.5.5.3"

```

All LibreOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-4.2.5.2"

```

All LibreOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-4.2.5.2"

```

We recommend that users unmerge OpenOffice:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-office/openoffice"

```

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openoffice.org
Vulnerability  : Multiple heap-based buffer overflows
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2665
Debian Bug     :

Timo Warns from PRE-CERT discovered multiple heap-based buffer overflows in
OpenOffice.org, an office productivity suite. The issues lies in the XML
manifest encryption tag parsing code. Using specially crafted files, an
attacker can cause application crash and could cause arbitrary code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-11+squeeze7.

openoffice.org package has been replaced by libreoffice in testing (wheezy) and
unstable (sid) distributions.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### CVE-2012-2665

**Title:** CVE-2012-2665: Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the XML manifest encryption handling code

**Announced:** August 01 2012

**Fixed in:** LibreOffice 3.5.5/3.6.0

**Description:**

Multiple heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the XML manifest encryption tag parsing code of LibreOffice. An attacker could create a specially-crafted file in the Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF) format which when opened could cause arbitrary code execution.

Thanks to Timo Warns of PRE-CERT for reporting this flaw. Users are recommended to upgrade to 3.5.5 or 3.6.0 to avoid this flaw

Summary
- -------
Multiple issues have been identified in LibreOffice / OpenOffice that
allow to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted office files.
Elements outside expected parent elements
-----------------------------------------
Initially, the aSequence attribute of a ManifestImport instance has
no memory allocated for PropertyValue elements.
ManifestImport::startElement() (re)allocates memory when
a "manifest:file-entry" XML element is encountered in the manifest
file. The property values are, for example, accessed when
a "manifest:encryption-data" XML element is found. If such
elements are located outside an expected parent element
"manifest:file-entry", ManifestImport::startElement() accesses
aSequence out-of-bounds.
Writes beyond fixed size buffer
-------------------------------
ManifestImport::startElement() allocates memory for 12 (=
PKG\_SIZE\_ENCR\_MNFST) PropertValue elements. If
a "manifest:file-entry" XML element has child elements that cause
startElement() to access more than 12 PropertValues, startElement()
accesses aSequence out-of-bounds.
Base64Codec::decodeBase64()
---------------------------
ManifestImport::startElement() calls Base64Codec::decodeBase64() to
decode the XML attributes for checksums, initialization vectors, and
salt values. Base64Codec::decodeBase64() implicitly assumes that the
source buffer sBuffer contains a number of characters divisible by 4.
If this is not the case, the called method FourByteToThreeByte()
writes up to 3 bytes past a buffer allocated on the heap.
Solution
- --------
The issue has been fixed in LibreOffice 3.5.5 and
Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1.
