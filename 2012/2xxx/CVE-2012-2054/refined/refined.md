Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the mass assignment vulnerability in Redmine, as described in the discussion and issue #10390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of `update_attributes(params[:news])` in the `NewsController`. This function allows mass assignment, where user-provided parameters (from `params[:news]`) are used to directly update the attributes of a `News` model object. Without proper filtering or whitelisting of allowed parameters, attackers could potentially modify fields they shouldn't have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Mass Assignment:** The core issue is the usage of mass assignment without strict parameter filtering. This allows attackers to potentially set arbitrary model attributes through the `params[:news]` hash.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** While Redmine has authorization checks, they were found to be insufficient in some cases. Specifically, it was possible to modify the `project_id` and `author_id` of a news item through a crafted HTTP request, even if the user should not have permission to do so.
- **Lack of Parameter Sanitization:** The system did not properly sanitize or whitelist which parameters could be updated, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Project News Posting:** An attacker with permission to update news in one project could post news to other projects by manipulating the `project_id` parameter during the update.
- **Impersonation:** An attacker could potentially post news as another user, including administrator or even anonymous users, by modifying the `author_id`.
- **Data Integrity Issues:** Attackers could modify other fields like `created_on` and `updated_on` although this is described as less dangerous than cross-project posting and impersonation.
- **Possible Escalation:** While the example uses news posts, similar vulnerabilities could exist in other areas of the application where mass assignment is used without proper parameter filtering.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is manipulating HTTP request parameters, specifically the `params[:news]` hash.
- **Hidden Form Fields:** Attackers can add hidden form fields such as `<input type="hidden" name="news[project_id]" value="ANY_PROJECT_ID_YOU_WANT_TO_POST_NEWS_TO">` to modify restricted parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user who has permissions to modify at least one news item.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to be aware that the `project_id` and `author_id` parameters are vulnerable to mass assignment.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Request:** The attacker needs the ability to modify or craft HTTP POST requests to include the malicious parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by using the `find_mass_assignment` tool.
- The Redmine team acknowledged the issue and addressed it in version 1.3.2. The fix included implementing proper parameter filtering or whitelisting.
- The issue was initially discussed in Redmine forums before a formal bug report was created.
- The Redmine team requested that security issues be submitted to `security at redmine dot org`.
