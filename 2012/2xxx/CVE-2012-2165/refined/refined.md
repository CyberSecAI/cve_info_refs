Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the encrypted password field for users in IBM Rational ClearQuest is accessible and can be displayed in query result sets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of encrypted password data. While the original password cannot be directly derived from the encrypted value, it allows an attacker to perform offline attacks.
- **Insufficient Data Masking:** The software fails to adequately mask or redact the encrypted password field when displayed in query results.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain the encrypted password values of users.
- This information can then be used in attempts to find other passwords that also encrypt to the same value, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with access to ClearQuest can execute queries that include the encrypted password field in the result set.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated into the ClearQuest application using ClearQuest Authentication (not LDAP).
- The attacker could be an insider user who has been granted the “All Users/Groups Visible” privilege or has some privileges that can perform the query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to a ClearQuest account that is authenticated using ClearQuest Authentication
- The attacker must be able to execute queries in ClearQuest and retrieve result sets.
- Having the "All Users/Groups Visible" privilege makes it easier for the attacker to query accounts, but is not necessarily a requirement.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects IBM Rational ClearQuest versions 7.1.1, 7.1.2 and 8.0, before the fix pack releases.
- The fix replaces the encrypted field with a sequence of asterisks, thus masking the data.
- The vulnerability does NOT affect users authenticated using LDAP Authentication.
- The CVSS score was re-evaluated from 6 to 3.5.
