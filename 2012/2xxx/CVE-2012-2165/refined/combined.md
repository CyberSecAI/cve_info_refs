# Security Bulletin: Encrypted passwords field available in result set of User record type (CVE-2012-2165)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The encrypted password field for a user is available to IBM Rational ClearQuest queries and can be displayed in a result set. This is an information disclosure that may assist an attacker in attempts to construct passwords that match that encrypted value.

## Vulnerability Details

| --- | --- |

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2012-2165](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2165)

**Description:** The ClearQuest user record contains a field for storing the encrypted password field for a user. This can be displayed to a user by including this field in a result set of a query on users. This password value is encrypted and the original password cannot be reconstructed from this encrypted value. However, an attacker could use this information disclosure to attempt to find other passwords that also encrypt to this value.

This defect only applies if the user is authenticated using ClearQuest Authentication. It does NOT apply if the user is authenticated using LDAP Authentication. This encrypted password value for LDAP Authentication is not a password.

The correction for this information disclosure is that the encrypted field will now display a sequence of asterisk characters, such as \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

## Affected Products and Versions

Any supported platform.

## Remediation/Fixes

Upgrade to one of the following releases:

* [Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 3 (8.0.0.3) for 8.0](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032773)
* [Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 7 (7.1.2.7) for 7.1.2](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24032770)

## Workarounds and Mitigations

**Workaround:**

Use LDAP authentication.

**Mitigation:**

Do not let untrusted users have ClearQuest accounts. Do not grant "All Users/Groups Visible" privilege to users in order to minimize the number of users accounts another user could query against.
