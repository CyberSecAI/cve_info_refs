Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2998:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of user-supplied input within the ad-hoc query module of Trend Micro Control Manager. This lack of proper input sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the backend database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, arising from the improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    - **Arbitrary SQL command execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the backend database.
    - **Information leakage:** Sensitive information stored in the database can be accessed.
    - **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers could potentially upload and execute arbitrary code by leveraging SQL injection to manipulate the database.
    - **Denial of service:** Malicious SQL commands can disrupt or disable the database.
- These actions could lead to compromise of the server and the data it contains.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the Trend Micro Control Manager web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the Trend Micro Control Manager web interface, which requires valid credentials, although the vulnerability can be exploited by a user with low-level privileges.
- The attacker must be able to craft and submit malicious SQL queries through the ad-hoc query module.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in the `AdHocQuery.NET.dll` and `AdHocQueryUtility.NET.dll` files
- The vulnerability affects versions of Trend Micro Control Manager prior to 6.0.0.1449 (English version) and prior to 5.5.0.1823 (English and Japanese versions).
- Patches were released to resolve the vulnerability (Critical Patch - Build 1823 for v5.5 and Critical Patch - Build 1449 for v6.0) which provide proper filters to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- The vulnerability was reported by Tom Gregory and Mada R Perdhana of Spentera.
