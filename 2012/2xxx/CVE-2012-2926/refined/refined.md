Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-2926:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Atlassian products (Bamboo, JIRA, Fisheye/Crucible, Crowd, and Confluence) utilize third-party XML parsers. This indicates a flaw in how these products process XML data, making them susceptible to malicious XML input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** Although not explicitly stated as XXE, the ability to "read all local files readable to the system user" strongly suggests that the vulnerability is related to improper handling of external entities in XML parsing. This allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive files on the server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute denial of service attacks, likely by submitting crafted XML that overloads the server or causes parsing to fail catastrophically.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The underlying issue appears to be the lack of proper sanitization or validation of XML input before it's processed by the third-party XML parsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary local files on the server that the application's user has permission to access, potentially exposing sensitive data like passwords, configuration files, and source code.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers can disrupt the availability of the service by causing the application server to crash or become unresponsive, impacting legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the submission of malicious XML payloads to the vulnerable applications.
*   Specific attack vectors vary per application. For example, Bamboo requires an authenticated user, while Fisheye and Crucible are vulnerable to unauthenticated attacks.
    *   **Bamboo:** Requires an account and login to execute the attack.
    *   **JIRA:** Requires an authenticated JIRA user. Additionally, the Tempo and Gliffy for JIRA plugins are also vulnerable.
    *   **Fisheye/Crucible:**  Does not require an account to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   **Crowd:** Requires that Crowd URLs be reachable.
    *   **Confluence:** Does not require an account. The Gliffy for Confluence plugin is also vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Bamboo:** Attacker needs an account with the Bamboo server instance.
*   **JIRA:** Attacker needs an account with the JIRA server instance.
*   **Fisheye/Crucible:**  No account needed, accessible remotely.
*  **Crowd:** Able to reach Crowd URLs.
*   **Confluence:** No account needed, accessible remotely.

**Additional Information**

*   **Severity:** The severity of the vulnerability is rated as **critical** for Bamboo, Fisheye/Crucible, Crowd, and Confluence. JIRA is rated as **high** severity.
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   **Bamboo:** All versions up to and including 3.4.4.
    *   **JIRA:** All versions up to and including 5.0.0.
    *   **FishEye/Crucible:** All versions up to and including 2.7.11.
    *   **Crowd:** All versions up to and including 2.4.0.
    *   **Confluence:** All versions up to and including 4.1.9.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Upgrade to the fixed versions.
    *   Disable public access (anonymous access and public signup) to the applications.
    *   Restrict the operating system user under which the applications are run, as a general security practice.
    *  For Fisheye/Crucible, disable remote APIs (Remote, SOAP and XML-RPC APIs), if they are not required.
    *  For Confluence, disable remote APIs (SOAP and XML-RPC APIs). Additionally, disable the following plugins: Office Connector, JUnitReport macro, confluence-jira3-macros, and WebDAV.
*   **Fix:**
    *   Upgrade to the specified fixed versions.
    *   For JIRA and Crowd, patches are available, but upgrades are recommended.
    *   For Fisheye/Crucible and Confluence, patches are not available, and upgrades are required.
    *   For JIRA and Confluence, update vulnerable third-party plugins, such as Gliffy and Tempo, in addition to the main application.

This vulnerability highlights the risks associated with using third-party libraries without proper security checks, especially when dealing with data parsing. The impact can range from DoS to serious data breaches.
