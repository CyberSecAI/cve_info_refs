# ConnMan: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201205-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in ConnMan, allowing
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/connman** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0-r1** |

### Background

ConnMan provides a daemon for managing Internet connections.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in ConnMan:

* Errors in inet.c and rtnl.c prevent ConnMan from checking the origin
  of netlink messages (CVE-2012-2320).
* ConnMan does not properly check for shell escapes when requesting a
  hostname via DHCP (CVE-2012-2321).
* An infinite loop error exists in client.c (CVE-2012-2322).

### Impact

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the process or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ConnMan users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/connman-1.0-r1"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Yes. The severity of this is quite high, its a default remote root exploit, as
connman is requesting hostname per dhcp by default and not checking for
shell escapes.
(I did not check whether they clean any other strings that could appear
and could contain newlines etc. when its written to a config file)

I think its this:
<http://lists.connman.net/pipermail/connman/2012-May/009473.html>

>
> 4) Check vpnc options for validity prior saving them:

AFAIK there is no patch for it yet. Upstream needs to verify/confirm these,
but I think its a real bug that lets you overwrite files.

Sebastian

From: Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer@...e.de>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: connman heads up / CVE requests

Hi,

I reported several issues to the connman developers last week and it
seems they made patches for most of them which were
posted on their mailing list. The one that I am missing is related
to the GKeyFile/VPN settings storage. I did not review the
patches itself, except checking them slightly.
The bug report is here:

<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=715172>

It was not a full review, so some parts remain unchecked.

Some dists seem to ship it and before it goes the wicd way,
I'd rather ask for CVE's myself.

Sebastian

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-05-10 17:59:00 UTC  ``` From secunia security advisory at $URL:  Description Some vulnerabilities have been reported in ConnMan, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and compromise a vulnerable system.  1) An error within the "dhcpv6_get_option()" function (gdhcp/client.c) when parsing certain responses can be exploited to trigger an infinite loop and cause a crash by sending specially crafted DHCP packets.  2) An error when parsing netlink messages can be exploited to cause a crash.  3) An error when handling hostnames does not strip or escape shell meta-characters when processing responses from a DHCP server and can be exploited to submit shell commands.  The vulnerabilities are reported in versions prior to 0.85.   Solution Update to version 0.85. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tony Vroon (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-05-10 21:37:00 UTC  ``` Use 1.0 and proceed to emergency stable please. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-05-10 22:03:20 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable: =net-misc/connman-1.0 Target keywords : "amd64 x86" ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Elijah "Armageddon" El Lazkani (amd64 AT)    2012-05-10 23:00:49 UTC  ``` amd64: compiles and runs  can we hide/fix unknown dependencies ?     net-misc/connman/connman-1.0.ebuild: DEPEND: !=sys-apps/systemd-37-r1 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tony Vroon (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-05-10 23:19:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=415415#c3)) > can we hide/fix unknown dependencies ? >    net-misc/connman/connman-1.0.ebuild: DEPEND: !=sys-apps/systemd-37-r1  +*connman-1.0-r1 (10 May 2012) + +  10 May 2012; Tony Vroon <chainsaw@gentoo.org> -connman-1.0.ebuild, +  +connman-1.0-r1.ebuild: +  Can not allow an experimental dependency to interfere with security stabling. +  As per arch testing by Elijah "Armageddon" El Lazkani in [bug #415415](show_bug.cgi?id=415415 "RESOLVED FIXED - <net-misc/connman-1.0-r1 : Multiple Vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-{2320,2321,2322})").

CVE-2012-2321 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2012-2321>):   The loopback plug-in in ConnMan before 0.85 allows remote attackers to   execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the (1) host name or   (2) domain name in a DHCP reply.  CVE-2012-2320 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2012-2320>):   ConnMan before 0.85 does not ensure that netlink messages originate from the   kernel, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions   and cause a denial of service via a crafted netlink message. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
