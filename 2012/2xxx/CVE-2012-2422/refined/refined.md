  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Intuit Help System Protocol vulnerability",
      "weaknesses": [
        "File disclosure vulnerability: Malicious HTML and Javascript can be used to retrieve a file from a ZIP archive if the user has local or network file system access to the archive.",
        "Heap corruption vulnerability: Malicious HTML and/or Javascript can potentially execute arbitrary code as the user viewing the malicious content."
       ],
      "impact": "An attacker may be able to retrieve sensitive files or run arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Malicious HTML",
         "Malicious Javascript"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must know or guess the path and file name of the target ZIP archive and the target file it contains. For file retrieval, the user must have local or network file system access to the targeted ZIP archive. The heap corruption vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution as the user viewing the malicious content."
    }
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The file retrieval vulnerability is limited to files directly inside ZIP archives, subdirectories are not accessible. The protocol involved is `intu-help-qb#` where '#' is a digit from 1 to 5. Disabling the protocol by deleting/renaming the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\[Wow6432Node]\\Classes\\PROTOCOLS\\Handler\\intu-help-qb#` or the `HelpAsyncPluggableProtocol.dll` file in the QuickBooks installation directory is a mitigation."
