## Vulnerability Analysis for CVE-2012-2679

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2679:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Red Hat Network Configuration Client (`rhncfg-client`) was setting insecure permissions (0644, world-readable) on the `/var/log/rhncfg-actions` log file. This file stores output from various `rhncfg-client` actions, including potentially sensitive information from configuration file comparisons (diffs).

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the world-readable permission on the `/var/log/rhncfg-actions` file.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The log file contained output from `rhncfg-client` actions, which could include sensitive configuration data when using the `--diff` option.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Leakage:** A local attacker could read the `/var/log/rhncfg-actions` file and gain access to sensitive configuration details that they should not have access to. This is particularly concerning if the diff action has been used to compare config files that are normally not world-readable.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not a direct privilege escalation, the vulnerability allowed a non-root user to potentially access files that would normally require root access to read by way of the actions log.
- **Compromise of Confidentiality:**  The primary impact is the compromise of confidentiality because config file contents are revealed.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is primarily local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the `rhncfg-client` is installed and where the actions log is present.
- **File Read:** The attacker needs to read the `/var/log/rhncfg-actions` file.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
- **Ability to Read Files:** The attacker must be able to read files from the file system. This is typically not a large obstacle given local access.
- **Knowledge of `rhncfg-client` actions:** The attacker needs to know that rhncfg-client actions may contain sensitive information in the log file.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Mitigation:** The fix for this vulnerability involves changing the permissions on `/var/log/rhncfg-actions` to be readable and writable only by the root user. Additionally, the `rhncfg-client` was modified to prevent it from creating diffs of files that are not already world-readable.
- **Affected Products:** Red Hat Network Tools for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 and their respective Extended Update Support versions are affected. Fedora releases 15, 16, and 17 are also affected.
- **Severity:**  The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate".
- **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by Paul Wouters of Red Hat.
- **RHSA-2012:1369:** This security advisory addresses CVE-2012-2679 by providing updated rhncfg packages.
