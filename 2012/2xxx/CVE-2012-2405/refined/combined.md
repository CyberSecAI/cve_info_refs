## User Testimonial

 "\*Awesome\* is kind of a lame and overused adjective on the Web, but I can't think of a better one for Gallery 1.25. Took me 15 minutes, start to finish, to install it on my hosted Linux server and build my first
album... awesome is the word. Features galore, and a no-brainer to
administer. Excellent.

# Gallery 3.0.3 and Gallery 2.3.2 Security Releases are available!

Submitted by ckdake on Tue, 2012-04-03 13:06

[Download Gallery 3
Version 3.0.3 (1.8MB)](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gallery/gallery-3.0.3.zip)
[Download Gallery 2](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gallery/gallery-2.3.2.zip)

We're releasing both Gallery 3.0.3 and Gallery 2.3.2 as security releases. Several researchers, working independently, discovered possible encryption-related vulnerabilities. Low-risk XSS vulnerabilities limited to the administration area were also reported. We thank the following individuals for reporting these issues: James 'albino' Kettle, George Argyros & Aggelos Kiayias, and Emanuel Bronshtein. They will be receiving bounties for these issues. Read our [Bounties](http://codex.gallery2.org/Bounties) page for details and how to submit any security issues you find. The CVE id for these issues is CVE-2012-1113.

We recommend that all users of Gallery 2 and Gallery 3 upgrade as soon as possible.

Gallery 3.0.3 includes a few [other small fixes](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gallery/query?status=closed&group=resolution&order=priority&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=version&col=resolution&milestone=3.0.3#no2), and Gallery 2.3.3 is strictly a security release.

## Upgrading Gallery 3

Upgrading is really easy! Unpack the new version, move the var/ directory of the old version to the new version's folder and then either browse to:
`http://your-site.com/gallery3/index.php/upgrader`
or at a shell prompt:
`php index.php upgrade`
For more detailed upgrade instructions, please refer to
the [Gallery
3 User Guide](http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery3%3AUser_guide%3AGallery3%3AInstalling_and_upgrading#Upgrading)

## Upgrading Gallery 2

A [very small change](http://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gallery?view=revision&revision=20992) is all that is needed. Drop in a new copy of all the files, or just grab the files from that commit and you'll be all set. You can also follow the much more detailed [Gallery 2 Upgrading steps](http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2%3AUpgrading).

## Got feedback?

If you have any overall feedback, please visit the [Gallery 3.0.3 Feedback](http://gallery.menalto.com/gallery_3.0.3_feedback) forum topic and let us know! If you have questions,
please visit the [Gallery 3 Wiki](http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery3), the home for Gallery 3 documentation.

@DamienA: go here instead <http://sourceforge.net/projects/gallery/files/gallery2/2.3.2/> and grab that version you need.

I had File integrity issues with those 2.3.1 -> 2.3.2 zip files, so I ended up grabbing the 2.3.2-developer.zip, uncompressed it on my multisite codebase and the Upgrader went smoothly.

FYI... The latest 2.x version still shows: "Latest stable release: 2.3.1"

@samahita: Looks like you're using a custom theme - try the fix from <http://gallery.menalto.com/gallery_3.0.3_feedback#comment-390009>

or see if there's an updated version.

For the Browny\_wind theme just replace the views/page.html.php in the browny\_wind theme with the one that comes with the wind theme.

That should fix the issue until the author of the theme updates it.

Thanks for the updates!

Is there any way to get a list of the specific files which were changed in 3.0.3 compared with 3.0.2? I've done quite a bit of hacking to a number of them, and I don't want to overwrite them all by doing an auto-update.

Best bet is to get a copy of <http://winmerge.org/> and do a comparison yourself.

I bet there is a way to go a GIT compare and get a list but I will let you do that if winmerge is not your style.

Winmerge shows 269 files that are different from 3.0.2 to 3.0.3. The Copyright date of 2012 was the only change in the first 10 files that I checked.

Anyone know how to exclude the copyright line from the compare? Or another method to find changed files?

I updated all the v 3.0.2 files to have the same Copyright Date as 3.0.3 files - after that Winmerge tells me there's 53 files with a difference. This is about as Scientific as Intelligent Design - trust the results at your own risk. <http://gfisk.com/images/g303v302.html>

Add-on comment: For Mac users (as well as Win and Linux), [DiffMerge](http://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html) also works well to find the differences. I used .\*Copyright \(C\) as the ruleset regex in the preferences to exclude from comparison those lines which changed the copyright date. Very helpful.
