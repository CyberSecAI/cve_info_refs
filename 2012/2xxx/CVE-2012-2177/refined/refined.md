Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2177:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in IBM Cognos BI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   User Interaction Required: The attack requires the victim to click on a malicious link and subsequently click another link on the rendered page for the exploit to be successful.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The attacker's JavaScript code is executed within the victim's web browser in the context of the vulnerable application's website.
*   Potential impacts include session hijacking (if httpOnly attribute is not set), defacement of the web page, or potentially more severe actions depending on the injected script and the context it's executed in.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is initiated by tricking the victim into clicking a malicious link.
*   This link would lead to a vulnerable page within the IBM Cognos BI application.
*   Once on the vulnerable page, the user needs to click an additional link for the exploit to trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript.
*   The attacker also needs to be able to trick a user into clicking the initial crafted link as well as an additional link on the rendered page to execute the malicious JavaScript.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Mitigation:**
*   Apply the provided interim fix from IBM.
*   Configure IBM Cognos BI 10.1 and above to use the httpOnly attribute for the session cookie, which mitigates session hijacking by preventing client-side scripts from accessing the session cookie.
