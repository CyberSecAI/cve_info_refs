- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `backupDB()` PHP script fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `onlyDB` parameter within the `backupDB.php` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted request to `backupDB.php` by providing malicious input in the `onlyDB` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the `backupDB.php` script and the victim needs to access the page.
