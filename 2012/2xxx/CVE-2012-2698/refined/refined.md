Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2698:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions "CVE-2012-2698" and describes an XSS vulnerability related to the "uselang" HTTP parameter in MediaWiki. Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `uselang` HTTP parameter. The application uses this parameter in single-quoted strings, without proper escaping, thus enabling a reflective XSS attack.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input through the `uselang` parameter is directly included in the HTML output without proper sanitization or escaping.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the `uselang` parameter.
*   **Session hijacking:** This code could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious pages, deface a site, or perform other actions in the context of the victim's session.
*   **Information disclosure:** The attacker could potentially gather sensitive information from the victimâ€™s browser or session.
*   **Denial of service:** Although less likely, an attacker could attempt to DoS using javascript redirects or infinite loops.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the payload in the `uselang` parameter and send this to a victim user.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could use social engineering to trick a victim into clicking on the malicious link.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **External attacker:** No specific access to the server is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker only needs to craft a malicious URL and deliver it to the intended victim.
*   **No specific permissions:** Exploiting the vulnerability does not require any user-level or admin permissions within the MediaWiki application itself.

**Additional Technical Details:**

* The vulnerability was found in MediaWiki versions 1.17.5, 1.18.4 and 1.19.1 and potentially affects older versions as well.
* The fix includes correctly escaping the `uselang` attribute and expanding the blacklist of potentially malicious elements in SVG files.
* Specific code snippets show the improper usage of the `uselang` parameter and the location of the fix.
* Patches were released to address this issue in multiple versions of MediaWiki (1.17.5, 1.18.4, and 1.19.1).
