1. **Verification:**
   - The provided content from `www.kb.cert.org` directly references CVE-2012-2999 and describes a CSRF vulnerability in Cerberus FTP Server, aligning with the CVE description. The content from `www.cerberusftp.com` provides release notes and mentions fixes for various vulnerabilities but does not specifically mention CVE-2012-2999.

2. **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the lack of proper validity checks on HTTP requests within the Cerberus FTP Server web interface. This allows an attacker to forge requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

3. **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to CSRF attacks via HTTP POST requests. The specific vulnerable endpoint is `targetip:10000/usermanager/users/modify`.

4. **Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation of this CSRF vulnerability can lead to:
     - **Information Leakage:** Sensitive information could potentially be disclosed.
     - **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain elevated privileges.
     - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker could disrupt the normal functioning of the FTP service.
   - The attacker could, for example, add a new user account to the FTP server.

5.  **Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through the web interface, where an attacker can craft a malicious HTTP POST request targeting a vulnerable endpoint on a legitimate users's browser session.

6. **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs access to the Cerberus FTP Server web interface, typically through stolen credentials or by tricking an authenticated user into executing the crafted request. They need a web browser to send the crafted POST request to the server.

7. **Additional Information**
    - The vulnerability is addressed in Cerberus FTP Server version 5.0.5 or higher.
    - Restricting access to the web interface is a good security practice to mitigate, but does not prevent, CSRF attacks.
    - The vulnerability was reported by redro0cky of Beijing Leadsec Technology Co., Ltd.
    - The CVSS base score is 3.8 and the vector is AV:L/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:N
