{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the U3D.8BI library plugin of Adobe Photoshop when parsing Collada (.DAE) asset elements. Specifically, a miscalculation occurs while allocating a buffer for a user-supplied string during the conversion of an element field from ASCII to Unicode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Improper calculation of buffer size",
      "Uncontrolled overwrite of stack memory",
       "User-controlled memcpy arguments"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite critical stack structures, including the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and the arguments of subsequent memcpy calls, leading to control of the execution flow and potentially achieving code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "By crafting a malicious Collada (.DAE) file with a specially crafted 'comments' field within the <asset><contributor> element",
       "Opening the crafted .DAE file using a vulnerable Adobe Photoshop version."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted Collada (.DAE) file. No specific privileges or system access are needed to exploit the vulnerability once the file is crafted.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the U3D.8BI library parses Collada (.DAE) files containing an overly long string within the comments tag under the asset tag. The `comments` field within the `asset` tag is vulnerable, leading to the overflow during the ASCII to Unicode conversion. The overflow occurs due to a miscalculation when allocating the buffer size which results in overwriting critical stack structures."
