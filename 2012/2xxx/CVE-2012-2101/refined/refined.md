{
  "CVE-2012-2101": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of enforcement of quotas on the number of security group rules a user can create.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Missing quota enforcement for security group rules"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can create a large number of security group rules, leading to the creation of numerous iptables rules on compute nodes, resulting in a denial of service.",
      "Attack vector": "An authorized user can use the EC2 API or OSAPI to create a large number of security group rules.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authorized user with the ability to create security group rules."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "OpenStack Nova"

       }
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can lead to a significant increase in the size of Nova's compute.log file due to the logging of iptables rules. Also, the fix includes adding quotas for both security groups and security group rules."
