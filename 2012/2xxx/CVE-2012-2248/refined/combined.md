It was uploaded to and affected Debian testing and unstable.  Testing
has not yet been officially "released", but some people use testing as
if it were an official release.  Unstable never gets released.

When I say released I meant in the sense of made available for
download, not in the sense of software engineering and doing a proper
"release".

Release information here:

<http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-dhcp-devel/2012-April/001275.html>

Any ways as you can see it's had a CVE assigned:

So for Debian Bug report logs - #690532
CVE-2012-2248: build system paths used in -DCLIENT_PATH

So my work here is done =).

I have my mail software setup to squish the headers really small. I
should probably rethink this space saving strategy.

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

FWIW, I have added a check to unix-privesc-check for privileged binaries that
have "PATH=" embedded in them and run it over a couple of fairly vanilla
Debian systems with KDE on it and seen a few other cases of embedded PATHs.
This yielded a few cases where "privileged" binaries trust
/usr/local/{bin/sbin} but nothing else untoward. trunk is currently in flux,
but vendors may wish to incorporate it into their release testing in due
course.

Wasn't the assigned CVE number already apparent as part of the subject

Subject: CVE-2012-2248: backdoor for user "zero79" due to dhclient’s hook $PATH
Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2012 11:31:40 +0200
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=690532;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: isc-dhcp-client
Version: 4.2.2.dfsg.1-5
Severity: critical
Tags: security patch

While debugging another issue, Mithrandir, mbiebl and I stumbled upon
the following:

All hooks in /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d, such as "samba" when the
samba package is installed, are called with a PATH environment variable
containing this:

PATH=/home/zero79/source/git/isc-dhcp/debian/tmp/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

Since hooks (at least "samba") can call arbitrary commands and are
running as uid 0 (root), this poses a security issue when the following
assumptions are true:

1. The system you want to exploit has samba installed (or any other
   package which comes with a dhclient-enter-hook).
2. The attacker has the possibility of obtaining the username "zero79"
   and thus can create executable files in
   /home/zero79/source/git/isc-dhcp/debian/tmp/usr/sbin
3. The DHCP hook needs to be called to trigger the exploit, which
   happens at least on system start or after /etc/init.d/networking
   restart, possibly also when just renewing the dhcp-lease
   (unverified).

Here is a demonstration of this issue:

zero79@squeezevm:~$ id -a
uid=1001(zero79) gid=1001(zero79) groups=1001(zero79)
zero79@squeezevm:~$ mkdir -p source/git/isc-dhcp/debian/tmp/usr/sbin
zero79@squeezevm:~$ cat >source/git/isc-dhcp/debian/tmp/usr/sbin/mv <<'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
echo "my script is run as: $(whoami) $(id -a)" > /tmp/exploited
EOF
zero79@squeezevm:~$ chmod +x source/git/isc-dhcp/debian/tmp/usr/sbin/mv
root@squeezevm:~# /etc/init.d/networking restart
Restarting networking (via systemctl): networking.service.
root@squeezevm:~# ls -hltr /tmp
total 8.0K
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 966 Oct 14 13:42 samba
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  65 Oct 14 14:02 exploited
root@squeezevm:~# cat /tmp/exploited
my script is run as: root uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

At this point, "zero79" has root access to the system.

Raphael Geissert has resolved this issue in a timely fashion, his
statement follows and his patch is attached:

 The insertion of that path does not appear to be malicious. Rather, it
 appears to be a mistake in debian/rules as --prefix is set to
 $(pwd)/debian/tmp/, instead of setting DESTDIR when calling make
 install. client/Makefile.am defines CLIENT_PATH to
 "PATH=$(sbindir):/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin", which is later injected
 into the env.

 Due to what appears to be a bug in squeeze's Makefile.am, squeeze is not
 affected.

 Attached patch fixes the problem.

 Since I've already built the package for wheezy, I'm going to upload it.

Using the term "backdoor" is inappropriate and quite misleading as it
implies malicious activity.  The issue is actually a build system
sanitization issue.

Also, to be fair, the same conclusions can be drawn on different
architectures for paths like /build/buildd-isc-dhcp-*:
<https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=isc-dhcp&arch=i386&ver=4.2.4-2&stamp=1347600978>

Closes: [690532](bugreport.cgi?bug=690532)
Changes:
 isc-dhcp (4.2.4-3) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * Maintainer security upload.
   * Fix cve-2012-2248: as of 4.2.x the build system prefix now gets included
     in CLIENT_PATH.  This has security implications since the build system's
     source path is now included in dhclient's search PATH on users' systems,
     so sanitize the prefix to not include build system paths (closes: #[690532](bugreport.cgi?bug=690532))
     - Patch thanks to Raphael Geissert

 path included in PATH

So, at the risk of sounding nitpicky, the Debian testing + unstable
archives are pretty much equivalent to Fedora rawhide.  Even though
Redhat's position is that issues affecting only rawhide should not get
CVE identifiers, in Debian I think we should try to be more honest, so
we'll assign identifiers to all "uploaded" versions (in Debian, we use
the term upload to mean that a package is available in an archive vice
the term release).

Best wishes,
Mike

## Notes

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

In Ubuntu, the build directory is set to
PATH=/build/buildd/isc-dhcp-4.2.4/debian/tmp/usr/sbin.
since it is a top-level directory, the attacker would need to
be root to exploit this. Also, USN-1571-1 sets an explicit
PATH in dhclient-script, so it's likely we're not vulnerable at
all.

Subject: Re: CVE-2012-2248: isc-dhcp, Debian-specific: build
	path included in PATH

Hi Kurt,
Issues only affecting testing/unstable should always be assigned a CVE ID
nonetheless. The Debian ecosystem is much more than stable alone:
There is a great deal of derivative distributions [1], which import packages
from Debian testing/unstable and having a CVE ID is a convenient way to
track whether they are affected.

[1] <http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census>

Cheers,
        Moritz

Message-Id: <201210151550.43688.geissert@debian.org>

Subject: CVE-2012-2248: isc-dhcp, Debian-specific: build path included in PATH

Hi,

Michael Stapelberg, Tollef Fog Heen, and Michael Biebl discovered that
dhclient was setting dhclient-script's PATH to one that included a
subdirectory of the build directory[1].
This issue is caused by the way isc-dhcp is packaged in Debian.

At least two versions of isc-dhcp for the amd64 (x86_64) architecture in
Debian were found two be setting PATH to a subdirectory of /home/zero79/,
which would allow a user with such HOME directory to be able to execute code
as root.

To clarify the bug report: it is not specific to samba or hooks in general,
PATH is injected in the environment passed to the execve() call that
executes dhclient-script.

Since this issue doesn't affect the stable release, there won't be a DSA.
This email is just a heads up.

Cheers,

I use stable. Usually one can't easily say how many users there is for package x. :)

Part of it also depends on usage. Google labels everything as a Beta,
sometimes for years and with millions of users. My experience is a lot
of people use Debian unstable (when I used Debian I did, otherwise
everything was to boring =). What would be interesting is if you could
provide download statistics from the main site. I know for a fact
CVE's have been assigned for publicly released applications that are
probably in use by less than 100 or in extreme cases possibly less
than 10 people globally.
