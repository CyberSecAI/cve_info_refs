```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The dhclient was setting dhclient-script's PATH to include a subdirectory of the build directory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The PATH environment variable used by dhclient-script included a build directory, allowing a local user to potentially execute code as root if they could create a malicious executable in that build directory path.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user with a specific HOME directory could execute code as root.",
  "Attack vectors": "A local user could exploit this by creating a malicious executable in the build directory included in the PATH and triggering the execution of dhclient-script, such as on system startup or by restarting networking.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create files in the build directory path. On Debian, at least two versions of isc-dhcp for the amd64 (x86_64) architecture were found to be setting the PATH to a subdirectory of `/home/zero79/`, which is where the malicious executable could be placed."
