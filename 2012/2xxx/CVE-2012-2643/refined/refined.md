   - The user must be convinced to take a standard action that does not feel harmful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote and does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into web forms that are processed by the YY-Board software.
- The attacker must convince the user to interact with the malicious link or content.
