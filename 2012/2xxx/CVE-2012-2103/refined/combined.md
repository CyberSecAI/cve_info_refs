I reread this one a few times, I'm not clear on what:

==========
printf 'GET
/cgi-bin/munin-cgi-graph/localdomain/localhost.localdomain/vmstat-day.png?foo
HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: localhost\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n' | nc
localhost 80

Provided that the filename actually exists, munin will render the image
==========

means exactly, does the file vmstat-day.png need to exist where? It
seems like if the image is of any size (say 20k or more) the
amplification (each get request = 20k of tmp space usage) and the
files have to be deleted manually it might qualify as a DoS.

helmut@...divi.de can you shed more light on this?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=812889#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-16 13:38:20 UTC  ``` An insecure temporary file use flaw was found in the way qmailscan (plug-in to graph output from qmailscan and clamav) plug-in of the Munin, a network-wide graphing framework performed scan of qmailscan log files for presence of disallowed characters. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks (possibly leading to attacker's ability to overwrite or remove arbitrary files, belonging to the user, running the Munin qmailscan log files scannning).  References: [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668778>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=812889#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-16 13:46:13 UTC  ``` This issue affects [*] the versions of the Munin package, as shipped with Fedora release of 15 and 16. Please schedule an update once final upstream patch is available.  --  This issue affects [*] the versions of the Munin package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 and Fedora EPEL 6. Please schedule an update once final upstream patch is available.  [*] We doesn't seem to ship Qmail package in Fedora / Fedora EPEL, thus not sure, how much widely Munin's qmailscan plug-in might be used there (but since Clamav Antivirus is shipped, assuming it would be possible to reach / exploit this via qmailscan plug-in).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=812889#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-16 13:48:15 UTC  ``` Created munin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 812893](show_bug.cgi?id=812893 "CLOSED ERRATA - munin various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 812894](show_bug.cgi?id=812894 "CLOSED ERRATA - munin various flaws [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=812889#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-16 13:57:02 UTC  ``` CVE Request: [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/16/5>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=812889#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2012-04-16 19:20:46 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/16/6>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=812885#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-16 13:32:41 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way munin-cgi-graph and munin-fastcgi-graph tools of the Munin, a network-wide graphing framework performed provided input sanitization. A remote attacker could issue a specially-crafted CGI request, which once processed by munin-cgi-graph / munin-fastcgi-graph tools would allow the attacker to inject terminal escape sequences into the Munin log file, leading to possibility to execute arbitrary commands or overwrite files in such crafted log file was later inspected in terminal honouring such escape sequences.

Please schedule an update once final upstream patch is available.  --  This issue affects [*] the versions of the munin package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 and Fedora EPEL 6. Please schedule an update once final upstream patch is available.  [*] Though particular Debian BTS entry:     <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668666#5>  mentions this would be an issue only for Munin v2.x versions, if I looked into the code correctly, the $comment string (to be added into Munin log) isn't properly sanitized even in earlier versions and thus as such, there shouldn't be precondition causing this to fail on earlier (current Fedora and EPEL Munin versions) too. Though didn't configure Munin to test and confirm this assumption (-^ based only on source code review).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=812885#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-16 13:47:29 UTC  ``` Created munin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 812893](show_bug.cgi?id=812893 "CLOSED ERRATA - munin various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 812894](show_bug.cgi?id=812894 "CLOSED ERRATA - munin various flaws [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=812885#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-16 13:56:39 UTC  ``` CVE Request: [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/16/5>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=812885#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2012-04-16 19:21:10 UTC  ``` Added CVE as per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/04/16/6>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request (minor) -- Two Munin graphing framework flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   the following three problems has been recently reported against Munin:
   [1] Insecure temp file use in the qmailscan plug-in:

       <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812889>
       <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668778>

   [2] Possibility to inject escape sequences into Munin's log file:

       <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812885>
       <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668666>

   [3] Remote users can fill /tmp filesystem:
       Red Hat would not consider this to be a security flaw =>
       no RH BTS entry.

       Original report:
       <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668667>

For the first two -- though both of them having minor security impact,
under suitable circumstances they could lead to trust boundary crossing =>
under our opinion they should get a (CVE-2012-*) identifiers.

For the third issue -- we wouldn't consider it to be a security
flaw. Just as something, which on improperly configured machine
could allow to fill in /tmp filesystem (just another way how to
do it, when the particular service isn't properly configured).

Could you allocate CVE ids for the first two issues?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

```
Package: munin-plugins-extra
Version: 1.4.5-3
Severity: important
Tags: security

The qmailscan plugin uses predictable filenames.

| grep "`date +%d\ %b\ %Y`" $LOG0 $LOG1 > /tmp/q$$

This can be used to overwrite arbitrary files owned by the munin user
using symbolic links.

This issue affects squeeze, wheezy and sid.

Note that few users will have enabled this plugin, because qmail is not
that popular among Debian users.

Hi Helmut,

thanks again for your bug reports!

<helmut> given the quality of the plugin in conjunction with its widespread
usage (count the number of qmail + clamscan installs please), i suggest rm?
;-)
<h01ger> i'm inclined to think thats sensible

but would prefer if this would be done upstream as I don't it smart to divert
from upstream here.

cheers,
	Holger

# USN-1622-1: Munin vulnerabilities

5 November 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Munin.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [munin](/security/cves?package=munin) - Network-wide graphing framework

## Details

It was discovered that the Munin qmailscan plugin incorrectly handled

temporary files. A local attacker could use this issue to possibly

overwrite arbitrary files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS,

Ubuntu 11.10, and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-2103](/security/CVE-2012-2103))

It was discovered that Munin incorrectly handled plugin state file

permissions. An attacker obtaining privileges of the munin user could use

this issue to escalate privileges to root. ([CVE-2012-3512](/security/CVE-2012-3512))

It was discovered that Munin incorrectly handled specifying an alternate

configuration file. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2012-3513](/security/CVE-2012-3513))
