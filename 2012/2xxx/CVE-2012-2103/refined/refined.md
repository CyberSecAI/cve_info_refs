Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2103:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `qmailscan` plugin in Munin uses predictable temporary file names when processing log files. Specifically, it uses a command like `grep "`date +%d %b %Y`" $LOG0 $LOG1 > /tmp/q$$`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure temporary file creation:** The plugin creates temporary files in the `/tmp` directory with predictable names based on the date, combined with the process ID ($$). This makes them vulnerable to symlink attacks.
- **Symlink vulnerability:** A local attacker can create a symbolic link with the same name as the predictable temporary file, pointing to an arbitrary file. When the `qmailscan` plugin executes, it will overwrite the target of the symlink.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary file overwrite/removal:** A local attacker could use this vulnerability to overwrite or remove arbitrary files owned by the user running the Munin `qmailscan` plugin (typically the `munin` user).
- **Potential privilege escalation:** Although not directly mentioned, the ability to overwrite arbitrary files could lead to privilege escalation if, for example, an attacker could overwrite a configuration file of a privileged service.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local attacker:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the Munin `qmailscan` plugin is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Must have a local account on the vulnerable system.
- Must have the ability to create symbolic links.
- Must be able to predict/determine the temporary file name used by the vulnerable script.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects versions of Munin prior to 2.0~rc6-1.
- The issue was addressed by removing the use of temporary files in the `qmailscan` plugin.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `qmailscan` plugin, which is not widely used by default because qmail is not as popular.
- The vulnerability affects Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 11.10, and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
