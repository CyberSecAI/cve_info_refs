Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2397:

**CVE-2012-2397:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue in ownCloud.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application does not properly validate the authenticity of requests, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in user's browser into sending malicious requests to the server.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can hijack the authentication of arbitrary users and make requests on their behalf. These requests could include actions that insert Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) sequences via contacts-related vectors.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is carried out remotely by tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page or link. The malicious page would then trigger the CSRF vulnerability to perform actions on the vulnerable application on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to get the victim user to load a malicious web page, link or other crafted request. The attacker does not need direct access to the ownCloud instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The initial report indicates the vulnerability is present in ownCloud 3.0.2.
*   The vulnerability is stated to be fixed in ownCloud version 3.0.3.
