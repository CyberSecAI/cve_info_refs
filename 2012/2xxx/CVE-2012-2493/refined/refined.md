{
  "CVE-2012-2493": {
    "Root cause": "Insufficient input validation in the ActiveX and Java components used for WebLaunch functionality of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary code execution vulnerability."
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could execute arbitrary code on systems that have received the vulnerable ActiveX or Java components. The attacker may supply vulnerable ActiveX or Java components for execution by an end-user. The code is executed with the privileges of the user's web browser session.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker must convince a user to visit a malicious web page and execute the vulnerable ActiveX control or Java applet. The process of executing the control or applet may require little or no user interaction because the vulnerable ActiveX controls and Java applets are cryptographically signed by Cisco.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a malicious webpage with the vulnerable components. The attacker must convince the user to visit this webpage."
