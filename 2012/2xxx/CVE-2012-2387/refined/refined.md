Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-2387

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Debian vote engine (devotee) uses cryptographically weak pseudo-random numbers to generate secret ballot monikers. The intended 48-bit random number generation was flawed as it only used a 32-bit seed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Randomness:** The pseudo-random number generator uses only a 32-bit seed, significantly reducing the effective entropy of the generated secret monikers, although the generator outputs 48 bit numbers.
*   **Predictable Ballot Monikers:** The weak random number generation makes the ballot monikers predictable through brute-force attacks.
*   **Use of /dev/urandom:** The software uses `/dev/urandom`, which can have less entropy than `/dev/random`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Compromise of Secret Ballots:**  Attackers can brute-force the generated ballot monikers, allowing them to discover the contents of supposedly secret election ballots.
*   **Retroactive Ballot Discovery:** The vulnerability allows the calculation of secret voter ballots from all past Debian elections that used the vulnerable version of the software.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Brute-Force Attack:** Attackers can systematically try different possibilities until they find the correct ballot monikers, revealing the ballot content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unprivileged Access:** An attacker does not need special privileges to perform the attack. They only need to be able to attempt to brute-force ballot monikers.
*   **Access to Ballot Monikers:** An attacker needs to know the way monikers are generated or be able to intercept or guess existing monikers.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the software implementation, specifically in the way random numbers are generated for ballot monikers.
*   The publicly available source code repository was out of date at the time of the report, but this was not a permanent state.
*   The software was planned to be packaged for Debian and would likely propagate to other distributions like Ubuntu, making it essential to assign a CVE ID.
