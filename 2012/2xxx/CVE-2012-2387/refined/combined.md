Subject: CVE id request: devotee (debian vote engine) cryptographically weak
 random numbers permit discovery of secret ballot submissions

Hi,

It has been disclosed [0] that the debian vote engine (devotee) [1]
uses cryptographically weak pseudo-random numbers (intended to be
48-bit, but really only 32-bit due to the use of a 32-bit seed feeding
the 48-bit number generator) to generate ballot secret monikers.  This
allows unprivileged persons to brute force the contents of presumably
secret election ballots, and makes it possible to calculate the
contents of secret voter ballots in all past debian elections.

Ideally, devotee should use a random secret moniker with fully 64 (or
preferably 128) bits that would require years rather than minutes or
days to brute force [2].

The source also uses /dev/urandom, which has less entropy than /dev/random.

Please assign an id for this issue.

Thanks,
Mike

Yes, the publicly available source repo is out of date right now, but
that won't always be the case.  Debian had a change in secretary, so
workflows have changed, and ideally a more public mode of operation
should be gotten back to.

Yes, it is indeed an issue in the software implementation itself.  See
original report for exact code lines that are flawed.

I can neither confirm nor not confirm that devotee is used outside of
debian, but it does seem like an obvious choice for online election
management.  It is however planned to be package for debian [0], and
ubuntu automatically syncs debian, so eventually they will also get
the package.  it is important that an id be assigned so that they are
aware that they will need to check the package when they do that sync.
