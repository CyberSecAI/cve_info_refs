The provided content is related to CVE-2012-2447.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Netsweeper Internet Filter WebAdmin Portal is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful CSRF attack allows for a breach in the content filtering system, resulting in a complete compromise of an organization's internet content filter and control over user's internet traffic. This can lead to privilege escalation, information leakage, and/or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via an HTTP POST method to the `/webadmin/accountmgr/adminupdate.php?act=add` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP POST request that is then unknowingly executed by a logged-in administrator. The attacker does not need to have access to the WebAdmin portal directly. They only need to trick an authenticated user into sending a malicious request.
