### CVE-2012-2135
Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the UTF-16 decoder of Python versions 3.1 through 3.3.
- Specifically, the `aligned_end` variable is not correctly updated after calling the `unicode_decode_call_errorhandler` function during error handling.
- This lack of update can lead to the decoder operating on incorrect memory regions during subsequent decoding operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of the `aligned_end` variable after error handling in the UTF-16 decoder.
- Possible out-of-bounds read due to the incorrect `aligned_end`, leading to data leaks.
- Potential for memory corruption due to writing outside allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leaks:** An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information by accessing portions of process memory outside the intended buffer.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The memory corruption can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Memory Corruption:**  Incorrect memory access can corrupt application data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through specially crafted UTF-16 encoded strings that trigger the error handling path within the decoder.
- An attacker needs to supply input that causes errors to occur in UTF-16 decoding.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply input to a Python application using the vulnerable UTF-16 decoder.
- No specific privileges are mentioned; it appears a local or remote attacker could trigger the vulnerability if they can provide the malicious input to a vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in issue #4868 when implementing faster UTF-8 decoding.
- Patches for Python 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3 were created to fix the issue.
- The vulnerability is present in python 3.1.3, 3.2.3 and 3.3.
- The fix involves updating the `aligned_end` variable and other minor issues.
- It was found that an additional vulnerability could be triggered when using the str() function instead of ascii(). This was found to be a heap-based buffer overflow, which is slightly more serious.
- A test case involving `b'\xd8\x00\x41'.decode('utf-16be', 'replace')` was created, with the goal of receiving  `\ufffdA` instead of `\ufffd\ufffdA`
- The issue was assigned CVE-2012-2135.
- Patches included tests to ensure the vulnerability was fixed.

This vulnerability was addressed in the following versions of Python:
- Python 3.2.3-1 (Debian)
- Python 3.3.1-1 (Debian)
- Python 2.7.4
- Python 3.2.4
