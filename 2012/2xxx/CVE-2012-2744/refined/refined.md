  "CVE-2012-2744": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the nf_ct_frag6_reasm() function in the Linux kernel's netfilter IPv6 connection tracking implementation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send specially-crafted packets to a target system that is using IPv6 and also has the nf_conntrack_ipv6 kernel module loaded, causing it to crash.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `nf_ct_frag6_reasm()` function within the netfilter IPv6 connection tracking module. It incorrectly handles IPv6 packets fragmented into a single fragment, specifically those that have a fragment header due to an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big message. The code was previously checking for `IP6_MF` or a non-zero offset, causing it to ignore single-fragment packets.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of fragmented IPv6 packets.",
        "Missing validation when reassembling packets"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending specially crafted IPv6 packets, leading to a system crash (NULL pointer dereference).",
      "attack_vector": "Remote attacker sends specifically crafted IPv6 packets.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker."
    },
    "patch": {
      "description": "The fix involves removing the invalid check and making reassembly handle fragment queues containing only a single fragment. The commit also addresses a related issue in `nf_ct_frag6_gather` by removing a faulty check and allowing reassembly of single-fragment packets.",

        "description": "A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's key management facility handled replacement session keyrings on process forks. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.",
        "vulnerability": {
            "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's key management facility related to the handling of replacement session keyrings. The `keyctl_session_to_parent(task)` function sets `->replacement_session_keyring`, however a child process created by `fork()` can inherit the bogus `->replacement_session_keyring` due to `dup_task_struct()`, leading to memory corruption and a system panic.",

          "description": "The fix ensures that `->replacement_session_keyring` is properly processed and cleared by `key_replace_session_keyring()`. The root of the problem is that the `->replacement_session_keyring` field gets copied over in `dup_task_struct()` (called from `fork()`) before `key_replace_session_keyring` has had a chance to run.",
