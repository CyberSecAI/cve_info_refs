Debian Security Advisory DSA-2493-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : asterisk
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2947 CVE-2012-2948
Debian Bug     : 675204 675210

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Asterisk, a PBX and
telephony toolkit.

CVE-2012-2947
	The IAX2 channel driver allows remote attackers to cause a
	denial of service (daemon crash) by placing a call on hold
	(when a certain mohinterpret setting is enabled).

CVE-2012-2948
	The Skinny channel driver allows remote authenticated users to
	cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon
	crash) by closing a connection in off-hook mode.

In addition, it was discovered that Asterisk does not set the
alwaysauthreject option by default in the SIP channel driver.  This
allows remote attackers to observe a difference in response behavior
and check for the presence of account names.  (CVE-2011-2666)  System
administrators concerned by this user enumerating vulnerability should
enable the alwaysauthreject option in the configuration.  We do not
plan to change the default setting in the stable version
(Asterisk 1.6) in order to preserve backwards compatibility.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:1.8.13.0~dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2012-008

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Skinny Channel Driver Remote Crash Vulnerability |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Denial of Service |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote authenticated sessions |
| **Severity** | Minor |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | May 22, 2012 |
| **Reported By** | Christoph Hebeisen |
| **Posted On** | May 29, 2012 |
| **Last Updated On** | May 29, 2012 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Matt Jordan < mjordan AT digium DOT com > |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2012-2948 |

| **Description** | As reported by Telus Labs:    "A Null-pointer dereference has been identified in the SCCP (Skinny) channel driver of Asterisk. When an SCCP client closes its connection to the server, a pointer in a structure is set to Null. If the client was not in the on-hook state at the time the connection was closed, this pointer is later dereferenced.  A remote attacker with a valid SCCP ID can can use this vulnerability by closing a connection to the Asterisk server in certain call states (e.g. "Off hook") to crash the server. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would result in termination of the server, causing denial of service to legitimate users.√¢¬Ä¬ù |

| **Resolution** | The pointer to the device in the structure is now checked before it is dereferenced in the channel event callbacks and message handling functions. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
