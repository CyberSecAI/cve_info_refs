Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-2948:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference exists in the Skinny (SCCP) channel driver of Asterisk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- When an SCCP client closes its connection to the server, a pointer in a structure is set to NULL.
- If the client was not in the on-hook state at the time of closing the connection, this NULL pointer is later dereferenced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, authenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by closing a connection while not in the on-hook state.
- Successful exploitation results in termination of the server, denying service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- Attackers need a valid SCCP ID.
- Closing a connection to the Asterisk server in certain call states (e.g., "off-hook") triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user with a valid SCCP ID.
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Asterisk server using the Skinny protocol.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate call states to leave the client in an off-hook state.
