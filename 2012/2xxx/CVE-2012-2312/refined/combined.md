... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=818837#c0)  Arun Babu Neelicattu    2012-05-04 07:01:25 UTC  ``` Security context propagation was not properly implemented. As a result, when a thread gets re-used from the thread pool, it still retains the security context from the process that last used it. The new security context is not properly propagated, and hence the previous security context will be in effect. A local attacker can use this flaw to escalate privileges in a malicious application deployed to the JBoss server.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=818837#c1)  David Jorm    2012-05-04 07:16:24 UTC  ``` This issue only affects JBoss AS 7.1.0, 7.1.1 and EAP 6 Beta.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=818837#c2)  David Jorm    2012-05-08 03:23:43 UTC  ``` Upstream bug: <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-8863>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=818837#c4)  David Jorm    2012-06-14 07:29:39 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw does not affect any Red Hat JBoss products, it only affects the JBoss AS 7 community releases.   ``` |  |
