        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The sanity check of s_log_groups_per_flex was not sufficient, leading to inconsistencies. A large s_log_groups_per_flex value could bypass the check on x86 architectures due to bit shifting limitations. Additionally, the sanity check relied on undefined behavior from oversized shifts, which could be optimized away by some compilers.",
