Subject: CVE request: two flaws fixed in rubygem-mail 2.4.4

Two flaws were corrected in rubygem-mail version 2.4.4:

A file system traversal in file_delivery method [1].

Arbitrary command execution when using exim or sendmail from the commandline [2],[3].

[1] <https://github.com/mikel/mail/commit/29aca25218e4c82991400eb9b0c933626aefc98f>

* Moved Mail.deliveries into Mail::TestMailer.deliveries. Now only gets mail appended to it if you are sending with the :test delivery\_method (only for testing)
* Version bump to 2.1.0

## Mon Jan 25 01:44:13 UTC 2010 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>[¶](#label-Mon+Jan+25+01-3A44-3A13+UTC+2010+Mikel+Lindsaar+-3Craasdnil-40gmail.com-3E) [↑](#top)

* Change :deliver! to deliver a mail object, bypassing the :perform\_deliveries and :raise\_delivery\_errors flags, also does not append the mail object to Mail.deliveries, thus the ! (dangerous). The intended use for :deliver! is for people wanting to have their own delivery\_handler (like ActionMailer uses) to track and handle delivery failures.
* Added :delivery\_handler to Message. Allows you to pass an object that will be sent :deliver\_mail(self) by the Mail::Message instance when it is sent :deliver and bypasses the usual delivery method.
* Changed :perform\_deliveries flag to be more consistent with it’s name, mail will not append itself to the Mail.deliveries collection if :perform\_deliveries is false

* Version bump to 2.0.4
* Added :perform\_deliveries to mail, will not actually call deliver on the delivery method if this is set to false, set to true by default.
* Added @delivery\_notification\_observers to mail messages, you can register an observer with mail by calling mail.register\_for\_delivery\_notification(observer) and then when mail is told to :deliver it will call your observer with observer.delivered\_email(self). It will call your observer if it actually performed the delivery or not (that is, irregardless of the :perform\_deliveries flag)
* Added ability to overwrite the Mail.deliveries store with an object of your choice instead of just an array, this is a good way to find out if something actually got delivered as if :perform\_deliveries is false, this collection will not get the mail message appended

* Version bump to 2.0.3
* Made body.sort\_parts! recursive, to do the entire body
* Added ability to use << on the results returned by the various address fields, ie, mail.to << ‘new@address’ now works
* Message now adds multipart/mixed as the content type if nothing is set and there are parts to the message
* Added #display\_names and #addrs to all address fields. #addrs returns the actual Mail::Address object for each address in the field.
* Body should call to\_s on given input… incase someone gave it an IO.readlines result (Array)

* Version 1.5.3, handling invalid input on fields. Highly recommended update
* Updated fields to always try parsing the given data (unless blank). This allows mail to catch invalid input and return UnstructuredFields. Makes mail a lot more resistant to invalid input.

* Version bump to 1.5.0
* Major API change in Message#field\_name. This WILL break your applications that use Mail. Message#field\_name now returns good, intelligent, default values. You can still access the field object by calling Message# or [Message#](/mikel/mail/blob/9beb079c70d236a5ad2e1ba95b2c977e55deb7af/%27field_name%27).

* Message-ID, Content-ID, References et al, now return the default value of the message ID without the angle brackets, as per RFC 2822, “Semantically, the angle bracket characters are not part of the msg-id; the msg-id is what is contained between the two angle bracket characters.”
* Message class now has getter and setter methods for all the supported field types explicitly. This allows us to return a “default” value for all fields.
* All address fields, when called from Message#to or Message#from or the like, return either a string of the address spec (mikel@test.lindsaar.net) if it is a single entry, or an array of address specs if there is more than one [‘mikel@test.lindsaar.net’, ‘ada@test.lindsaar.net’]

* Resolved Issue #5 - Message ID not handling multiple periods in left hand side
* Resolved Issue #6 - Ordering of add\_file and body items causes invalid emails

## Tue Nov 10 08:15:14 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>[¶](#label-Tue+Nov+10+08-3A15-3A14+UTC+2009+Mikel+Lindsaar+-3Craasdnil-40gmail.com-3E) [↑](#top)

* Resolved Issue #5 - Message ID generation issue
* Resolved Issue #7 - README add\_file examples don’t seem to work - Updated readme and rdoc in Message#add\_file

## Mon Nov 9 23:38:33 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>[¶](#label-Mon+Nov++9+23-3A38-3A33+UTC+2009+Mikel+Lindsaar+-3Craasdnil-40gmail.com-3E) [↑](#top)

* Added ability to create new email via a hash or hash-like object. <mikel>
* Moved all of the Part init into the Message class. Part now just uses Message’s init, also moved all the attachment related functions into Message. As Part is a subclass of message, you shouldn’t see any interface changes here.

* Handled unstructured field folding “blank” lines
* Fixed error in header.rb that created fields into an array, instead of a FieldList, resulting in mail.encode returning a random sort order on the header.
* Made unstructured fields attempt to decode their values on :decode

* Renamed Mail::Message.encode! to Mail::Message.ready\_to\_send!, deprecated :encode! <mikel>
* Rewrote encoding and decoding methods on all classes. Adds a lot of boiler plate code, but allows us to be really precise in each field type that needs custom encoding. Now all encoding is done by the field\_type itself. Need to follow through on the body. <mikel>
* Bump version to 1.2.0 due to changes of :encoded, :decoded behaviour <mikel>

## Tue Nov 3 00:59:45 UTC 2009 Mikel Lindsaar <raasdnil@gmail.com>[¶](#label-Tue+Nov++3+00-3A59-3A45+UTC+2009+Mikel+Lindsaar+-3Craasdnil-40gmail.com-3E) [↑](#top)

* Tested mail against entire Enron set (2.3gb) and the Trec 2005 set (0.5gb), ~ half a million emails without crashing <jlindley>
* Some headers only can appear once, enforce during header parse assignment. <jlindley>
* Convert empty bodies into empty arrays instead of nil. <jlindley>
* Handle blank content dispositions. <jlindley>
* Mention Trec 2005 Spam Corpus in readme <jlindley>
* Add ‘rake corpus:verify\_all’ to allow parse checks in bulk. <jlindley>
* Added handling of multi value parameters, like filename\*1\*=“us-ascii’en’blah” filename\*2=“bleh” <mikel>
* Added dependency on ActiveSupport 2.3 or higher <mikel>

* handle OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY\_NONE returning 0 <jlindley>
* doing Mail.new { content\_type [text, plain, { charset => UTF-8 }] } is now possible (content type accepts an array) <mikel>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
