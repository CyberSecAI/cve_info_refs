```
Root cause of vulnerability: The Axigen Mail Server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the email body, allowing the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a crafted email. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

Attack vectors: Sending a specially crafted email containing malicious HTML/JavaScript via SMTP to a vulnerable Axigen Mail Server. When a user views the email, the malicious code is executed.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send an email to a user of the vulnerable Axigen Mail Server, and needs valid credentials for the SMTP server they are using to send the mail.
