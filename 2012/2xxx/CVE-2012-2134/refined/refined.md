{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how bind-dyndb-ldap handles LDAP query errors. Specifically, when an LDAP search returns an unexpected error, bind-dyndb-ldap insufficiently escapes the LDAP base DN (distinguished name), leading to an invalid query. This triggers a retry loop, causing the named service to hang and become unresponsive.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insufficient escaping of the LDAP base DN",
    "Improper error handling of LDAP query errors leading to retry loop"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can send specially crafted DNS queries to a named server configured with bind-dyndb-ldap. This triggers a flaw leading to the named service becoming unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote, via sending crafted DNS queries to a vulnerable named server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries to a BIND server that uses the vulnerable bind-dyndb-ldap plugin with a specially crafted DNS query that triggers an LDAP query error."
