Subject: CVE request(?): hostapd: improper file permissions of hostapd's config leaks credentials

Hi Kurt,
Hi vendors,

not too critical in my opinion, but I think still worth to be at least
mentioned briefly as other distros such as Fedora 16 were affected too:

<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=740964>

I'm not sure whether this issue should get a CVE, but in the past similar
vulnerabilities got a CVE (e.g. CVE-2012-0863).

Thanks,
Matthias

We have previously checked this with John W.Linville (Cc-ed on this post too)
with reply from him being as inlined below:

Jan,

I think you understand it all correctly.

Thanks,

John W. Linville            The water won't run clean until you get
linville@...hat.com                       the pigs out of the creek.

---</inline>---

Thus basically from the above, we wouldn't look at this one as a
security flaw, because this is more question of proper configuration,
rather than a real security flaw (the administrator needs in any
case edit /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf it to suite their needs / their
local wireless configuration before being able to use the hostapd
service. And in that moment [when entering sensitive WPA information
there], they should also change the permissions of the hostapd
configuration it to be more secure / not readable by all local users).

Thus maybe something to be explicitly mentioned in the documentation
(change permissions of the config file post update), but not a security
flaw.

 From <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0863> and
mainly from:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mumble/+bug/783405/comments/0](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/mumble/%2Bbug/783405/comments/0)

the passwords in this case were stored in plaintext in the database,
which is something slightly different.

Hope this helps.

Regards, Jan.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=824660#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-23 22:32:47 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the default permissions of /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf were insecure (0644) considering they could contain credentials (PSKs, shared radius secrets, etc.) that would then be world readable.  This is a low-impact flaw that be mitigated by changing the permissions to the file (upstream has done this now).  This was assigned [CVE-2012-2389](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2389) [2] (although no credentials are written by any tools or by default to this file, so an administrator should logically tighten up the permissions if saving sensitive information to the file).  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=740964> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/23/13>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=824660#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-23 22:33:42 UTC  ``` Created hostapd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 824661](show_bug.cgi?id=824661 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2389 hostapd: insecure default permissions on /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=824660#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-06-19 21:11:27 UTC  ``` This is corrected via hostapd-0.7.3-9.fc17 and hostapd-0.7.3-9.fc16.   ``` |  |
