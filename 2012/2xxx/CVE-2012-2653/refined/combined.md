# arpwatch: Privilege escalation — GLSA **201607-16**

arpwatch is vulnerable to the escalation of privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/arpwatch** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.15-r8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.15-r8** |

### Background

The ethernet monitor program; for keeping track of ethernet/ip address
pairings.

### Description

Arpwatch does not properly drop supplementary groups.

### Impact

Attackers, if able to exploit arpwatch, could escalate privileges
outside of the running process.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All arpwatch users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --verbose --oneshot ">=net-analyzer/arpwatch-2.1.15-r8"

```

I have to agree. Changing UID/GID from root to something else is a security
feature by reducing privileges and write access to system files. Not doing it
correctly is CWE-271. Looking it up, you can easily find 2 CVE's that are about
not dropping supplemental groups.

If it were intended that you change uid/gid but retain a supplemental group,
then you don't understand how /etc/group was supposed to be setup and used.
Additionally you would have called initgroups() to pickup the new group
memberships associated with that acct. So, its always wrong to call setgid()||
setuid() without taking care of supplemental groups.

Failing to drop supplemental groups, though, is not a vulnerability. Its an
exposure to risk because you can bet someone will find another hole and exploit
it and these extra privs allow them to escalate further.

Here is a real life case:

+ if ( initgroups(pw->pw_name, NULL) != 0 || setgid(pw->pw_gid) != 0 ||
+                                setuid(pw->pw_uid) != 0 )

This is not upstream. This is a patch to drop capabilities by changing uid/gid.
The person writing the patch intended to do the right thing - but failed. See
the bug? This is in a network facing daemon that parses untrusted network
packets.

Package        : arpwatch
Vulnerability  : fails to drop supplementary groups
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2653
Debian Bug     : 674715

Steve Grubb from Red Hat discovered that a patch for arpwatch (as shipped at
least in Red Hat and Debian distributions) in order to make it drop root
privileges would fail to do so and instead add the root group to the list of
the daemon uses.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1a15-1.1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1a15-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1a15-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your arpwatch packages.

Wow.  The NULL results in group 0 being added to the supplementary
groups list (so it survives the setgid(), at least on my quick test).

How did you spot this?  Compiler warning?

Yes. If you put that one snippet of code into google, you would find arpwatch is
the culprit.

It was more of an empirical thing. I had a script that started all daemons and
it walked the proc tree.  If any uid != 0, it would check to see if there were
any supplemental groups. Arpwatch had different supplemental groups than
everything else that did this wrong, so I looked at the code to see what was
different and found this bug.
