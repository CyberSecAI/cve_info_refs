Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-2707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from issues within the Hostmaster (Aegir) module for Drupal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Access Bypass: The module has an access control vulnerability that allows unauthorized users to bypass intended access restrictions.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The module is also vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Access Bypass: Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data within the Hostmaster/Aegir system.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Access Bypass: The vulnerability likely involves improper access control checks within the module, which may be exploited via direct requests or specially crafted inputs.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Attackers would likely inject malicious scripts through input fields or data that the module does not sanitize, which are then executed by a victim's web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable Hostmaster/Aegir module.
- For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code that gets displayed to other users.
