Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper capability checks within the question bank feature of Moodle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Permission Checks:** The system failed to correctly verify user capabilities when working within the question bank. This included:
    - Incorrect checks when editing/viewing questions.
    - Failure to verify question authorship.
    - Displaying UI elements to users who lacked the necessary permissions.
    - Incorrect permission checks when saving questions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Users could potentially perform actions in the question bank that they should not have been authorized to perform based on their roles.
    - This could include viewing or editing questions they should not have access to.
    - It could also involve users accessing UI elements they should not be able to see, potentially exposing functionality that should have been restricted.
    - Users could also save changes they should not be able to make.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Moodle web interface, specifically when accessing and interacting with the question bank.
- Attackers would exploit the lack of proper capability checks when attempting to perform actions within the question bank.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers would need a valid Moodle account.
- Attackers would need to have a role within the Moodle instance that has some access to the question bank, but not the specific permissions they would be exploiting.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported by Tim Hunt and assigned the Moodle issue number MDL-32239.
- This vulnerability affected Moodle versions 2.2 to 2.2.2+ and 2.1 to 2.1.5+.
- The fix for the issue is available in the Moodle Git repository (commit hash: 51c5e6057c67687f5d872f8a228cfea275abf576).
