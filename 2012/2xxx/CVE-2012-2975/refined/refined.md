{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the traffic overview page of the F5 Networks ASM appliance.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to lack of sanitization of malicious requests propagated to the summary listings page.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of an authenticated user's session, potentially leading to account compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending multiple malicious requests to the traffic overview page which propagate to the summary listings page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to send the initial malicious requests. However, an authenticated user needs to view the summary page for the malicious script to execute."
