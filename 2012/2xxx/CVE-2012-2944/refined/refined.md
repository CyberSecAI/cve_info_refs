{
  "CVE-2012-2944": {
    "Description": "Buffer overflow in the addchar function in common/parseconf.c in upsd in Network UPS Tools (NUT) before 2.6.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (electric-power outage) via a long string containing non-printable characters.",
    "Root cause": "The `addchar` function in `common/parseconf.c` did not properly handle non-printable characters. It copied these characters to a buffer without validating their length, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (electric-power outage).",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a long string containing non-printable characters to the `upsd` service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send data to the `upsd` service over the network."
