Fix [CVE-2012-2944](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4c72-hpc9-gqmj "CVE-2012-2944"): upsd can be remotely crashed

NUT server (upsd), from versions 2.4.0 to 2.6.3,  are exposed to
crashes when receiving random data from the network.

This issue is related to the way NUT parses characters, especially
from the network. Non printable characters were missed from strings
operation (such as strlen), but still copied to the buffer, causing
an overflow.

Thus, fix NUT parser, to only allow the subset Ascii charset from
Space to ~

### I.3. Changes from 2.8.0 to 2.8.1

* NUT documentation recipes were revised, so many of the text source files
  were renamed to `*.adoc` pattern. Newly, a `release-notes.pdf` and HTML
  equivalents are generated. Packages which deliver documentation may need
  to update the lists of files to ship. [[#1953](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1953)] Developers may be impacted
  by new `configure --enable-spellcheck` toggle (should add spelling checks
  to `make check` by default, if tools are available) to facilitate quicker
  acceptance of contributions. Packaging systems may now want to explicitly
  disable it, if it blocks package building (pull requests to update the
  `docs/nut.dict` are a better and welcome solution). [[#2067](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/2067)]
* Several improvements regarding simultaneous support of USB devices that
  were previously deemed "identical" and so NUT driver instances did not
  start for all of them:

  + Some more drivers should now use the common USB device matching logic
    and the 7 `ups.conf` options for that [[#1763](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1763)], and man pages were
    updated to reflect that [[#1766](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1766)];
  + The `nut-scanner` tool should suggest these options in its generated
    device configuration [[#1790](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1790)]: hopefully these would now suffice for
    sufficiently unique combinations;
  + The `nut-scanner` tool should also suggest sanity-check violations
    as comments in its generated device configuration [[#1810](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1810)], e.g. bogus
    or duplicate serial number values;
  + The common USB matching logic was updated with an `allow_duplicates`
    flag (caveat emptor!) which may help monitor several related no-name
    devices on systems that do not discern "bus" and "device" values
    (although without knowing reliably which one is which… sometimes it
    is better than nothing) [[#1756](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1756)].
* Work on NUT for Windows branch led to situation-specific definitions of
  what in POSIX code was all "file descriptors" (an `int` type). Now such
  entities are named `TYPE_FD`, `TYPE_FD_SER` or `TYPE_FD_SOCK` with some
  helper macros to name and determine "invalid" values (closed file, etc.)
  Some of these changes happened in NUT header files, and at this time it
  was not investigated whether the set of files delivered for third-party
  code integration (e.g. C/C++ projects binding with `libnutclient` or
  `libupsclient) is consistent or requires additional definitions/files.
  If something gets broken by this, it is a bug to address in future [[#1556](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1556)]
* Further revision of public headers delivered by NUT was done, particularly
  to address lack of common data types (`size_t`, `ssize_t`, `uint16_t`,
  `time_t` etc.) in third-party client code that earlier sufficed to only
  include NUT headers. Sort of regression by NUT 2.8.0 (note those consumers
  still have to re-declare some numeric variable types used) [[#1638](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1638)]

  + For practical example of NUT consumer adaptation (to cater to both old and
    new API types) please see <https://github.com/collectd/collectd/pull/4043>
* Added support for `make install` of PyNUT module and NUT-Monitor desktop
  application — such activity was earlier done by packages directly; now
  the packaging recipes may use NUT source-code facilities and package just
  symlinks as relevant for each distro separately [[#1462](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1462), [#1504](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1504)]
* The `upsd.conf` listing of `LISTEN` addresses was previously inverted
  (the last listed address was applied first), which was counter-intuitive
  and fixed for this release. If user configurations somehow relied on this
  order (e.g. to prioritize IPv6 vs. IPv4 listeners), configuration changes
  may be needed. [[#2012](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/2012)]
* The `upsd` configured to listen on IPv6 addresses should handle only
  IPv6 (and not IPv4-mappings like it might have done before) to avoid
  surprises and insecurity — if user configurations somehow relied on
  this dual support, configuration changes may be needed to specify both
  desired IP addresses. Note that the daemon logs will now warn if a
  host name resolves to several addresses (and will only listen on the
  first hit, as it did before in such cases). [[#2012](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/2012)]
* A definitive behavior for `LISTEN *` directives became specified, to try
  handling both IPv4 and IPv6 "any" address (subject to `upsd` CLI options
  to only choose one, and to OS abilities). This use-case may be practically
  implemented as a single IPv6 socket on systems with enabled and required
  IPv4-mapped IPv6 address support, or as two separate listening sockets -
  logged messages to this effect (e.g. inability to listen on IPv4 after
  opening IPv6) are expected on some platforms. End-users may also want to
  reconfigure their `upsd.conf` files to remove some now-redundant `LISTEN`
  lines. [[#2012](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/2012)]
* Added support for `make sockdebug` for easier developer access to the tool;
  also if `configure --with-dev` is in effect, it would now be installed to
  the configured `libexec` location. A man page was also added. [[#1936](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1936)]
* NUT software-only drivers (dummy-ups, clone, clone-outlet) separated from
  serial drivers in respective Makefile and configure script options - this
  may impact packaging decisions on some distributions going forward [[#1446](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1446)]
* GPIO category of drivers was added (`--with-gpio` configure script option) -
  this may impact packaging decisions on some (currently Linux released 2018+)
  distributions going forward [[#1855](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1855)]
* An explicit `configure --with-nut-scanner` toggle was added, specifically
  so that build environments requesting `--with-all` but lacking `libltdl`
  would abort and require the packager either to install the dependency
  or explicitly forfeit building the tool (some distro packages missed it
  quietly in the past) [[#1560](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1560)]
* An `upsdebugx_report_search_paths()` method in NUT common code was added,
  and exposed in `libnutscan.so` builds in particular - API version for the
  public library was bumped [[#317](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/317)]
* Some environment variable support was added to NUT programs, primarily
  aimed at wrappers such as init scripts and service unit definitions,
  allowing to tweak what (and whether) they write into debug traces, and
  so "make noise" or "bring invaluable insights" to logs or terminal:

  + A `NUT_DEBUG_LEVEL=NUM` envvar allows to temporarily boost debugging
    of many daemons (`upsd`, `upsmon`, drivers, `upsdrvctl`, `upssched`)
    without changes to configuration files or scripted command lines. [[#1915](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1915)]
  + A `NUT_DEBUG_PID` envvar (presence) support was added to add current
    process ID to tags with debug-level identifiers. This may be useful
    when many NUT daemons write to the same console or log file, such as
    in containers/plugins for Home Assistant, storage appliances, etc. [[#2118](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/2118)]
  + A `NUT_QUIET_INIT_SSL` envvar (presence or "true" value) prevents
    `libupsclient` consumers (notoriously `upsc`) from reporting whether
    they have initialized SSL support. [[#1662](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1662)]
  + A `NUT_QUIET_INIT_UPSNOTIFY` envvar (presence or "true" value)
    prevents daemons which can notify service management frameworks (such
    as systemd) about passing their lifecycle milestones, to not report
    loudly if they could not do so (e.g. running on a system without a
    framework, or misconfigured so they could not report and the OS would
    restart the false-positively "unresponsive" service). [[#2136](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/2136)]
* `configure` script, reference init-script and packaging templates updated
  to eradicate `@PIDPATH@/nut` ambiguity in favor of `@ALTPIDPATH@` for the
  unprivileged processes vs. `@PIDPATH@` for those running as root [[#1719](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1719)]
* The "layman report" of NUT configuration options displayed after the run
  of `configure` script can now be retained and installed by using the
  `--enable-keep_nut_report_feature` option; packagers are welcome to make
  use of this, to better keep track of their deliveries [[#1826](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1826), [#1708](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1708)]
* Renamed generated nut-common.tmpfiles(.in) ⇒ nut-common-tmpfiles.conf(.in)
  to install a /usr/lib/systemd-tmpfiles/\*.conf pattern [[#1755](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1755)]

  + If earlier NUT v2.8.0 package recipes for your Linux distribution dealt
    with this file, you may have to adjust its name for newer releases.
  + Several other issues have been fixed related to this file and its content,
    including [#1030](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1030), [#1037](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1037), [#1117](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1117) and [#1712](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1712)
* Extended Linux systemd support with optional notifications about daemon
  state (READY, RELOADING, STOPPING) and watchdog keep-alive messages.
  Note that `WatchdogSec=` values are currently NOT pre-set into systemd
  unit file templates provided by NUT, this is an exercise for end-users
  based on sizing of their deployments and performance of monitoring station
  [[#1590](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1590), [#1777](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1777)]
* snmp-ups: some subdrivers (addressed using the driver parameter `mibs`)
  were renamed: `pw` is now `eaton_pw_nm2`, and `pxgx_ups` is `eaton_pxg_ups`
  [[#1715](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1715)]
* The `tools/gitlog2changelog.py.in` script was revised, in particular to
  generate the `ChangeLog` file more consistently with different versions
  of Python interpreter, and without breaking the long file paths in the
  resulting mark-up text. Due to this, a copy of this file distributed with
  NUT release archives is expected to considerably differ on first glance
  from its earlier released versions (not just adding lines for the new
  release, but changing lines in the older releases too) [[#1945](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1945), [#1955](https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1955)]

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
