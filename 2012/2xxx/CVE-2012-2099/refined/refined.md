Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the Wikidforum 2.10 software. This allows attackers to inject malicious code through various input fields, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities are present within the Wikidforum 2.10 application. Specifically:
    *   Search field is vulnerable to XSS via the input `"`
    *   Advanced Search's author field is vulnerable to XSS via the input `"`
    *   Advanced Search's `select_sort` parameter is vulnerable to XSS via the input `>![](N)`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session.
*   This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Stealing session cookies.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the application's search functionality. Malicious code is injected into input fields which are not sanitized correctly.
*   Specifically, the attack vectors include:
    *   The main search field.
    *   The author field within the advanced search options.
    *   The `select_sort` POST parameter within the advanced search.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or access levels.
*   The attacker only needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable application through a web browser.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious input that will be processed by the application without proper sanitization.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content mentions potential SQL injection vulnerabilities within the Advanced Search's `select_sort` and `opt_search_select` parameters but these were not assigned a CVE ID.
*   The advisory indicates that the vendor was informed about the vulnerabilities multiple times but did not respond initially.
*   The CVE-2012-2099 ID was specifically assigned for the identified XSS issues.
