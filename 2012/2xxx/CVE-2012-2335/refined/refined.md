  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-2335",
    "description": "Additional unsafe cgi wrapper scripts are also fixed now.",
    "related_cves": [
      "CVE-2012-1823",
       "CVE-2012-2311",
       "CVE-2012-2336",
       "CVE-2012-2386",
       "CVE-2012-2143"

    ],
    "root_cause": "PHP-CGI setups improperly handle query string parameters passed via the command line, due to insecure cgi wrapper scripts. The php-cgi binary receives the query string parameters as command-line arguments. These arguments are not correctly sanitized, allowing command-line switches to be injected.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unsafe handling of command-line arguments",
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Exposure of sensitive information through source code disclosure",
      "Potential for arbitrary code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information (such as source code), cause a denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the query string of a URL to inject command-line arguments",
      "Using crafted URLs that include PHP command-line switches (e.g., -s, -d, -c)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication. They only need to send a specially crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable PHP-CGI application.",
