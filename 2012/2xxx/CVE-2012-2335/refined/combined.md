DESCRIPTION According to PHP's website, "PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML." When PHP is used in a CGI-based setup (such as Apache's mod_cgid), the php-cgi receives a processed query string parameter as command line arguments which allows command-line switches, such as -s, -d or -c to be passed to the php-cgi binary, which can be exploited to disclose source code and obtain arbitrary code execution.  An example of the -s command, allowing an attacker to view the source code of index.php is below: <http://localhost/index.php?-s>  IMPACT A remote unauthenticated attacker could obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service condition or may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server.  SOLUTION We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.  REFERENCES <http://www.php.net/> <http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.cgi-bin.php>  CREDIT Thanks to De Eindbazen for reporting this vulnerability.  This document was written by Michael Orlando.    ``` Patches[php-cgi-disable-argv](patch-display.php?bug_id=61910&patch=php-cgi-disable-argv&revision=latest) (last revision 2012-05-06 00:14 UTC by neweracracker at gmail dot com) [CVE-2012-1823.patch](patch-display.php?bug_id=61910&patch=CVE-2012-1823.patch&revision=latest) (last revision 2012-05-05 20:59 UTC by tyukish at parallels dot com) [cgi.diff-fix-check.patch](patch-display.php?bug_id=61910&patch=cgi.diff-fix-check.patch&revision=latest) (last revision 2012-05-04 01:08 UTC by erik at pizzadoos dot com) [cgi.diff](patch-display.php?bug_id=61910&patch=cgi.diff&revision=latest) (last revision 2012-05-02 18:45 UTC by rasmus@php.net) Pull RequestsHistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2012-05-02 17:57 UTC] [stas@php.net](//people.php.net/stas)** -CVE-ID: +CVE-ID: 2012-1823 **[2012-05-02 18:40 UTC] [felipe@php.net](//people.php.net/felipe)** -Private report: No +Private report: Yes **[2012-05-02 18:45 UTC] [rasmus@php.net](//people.php.net/rasmus)** ``` The following patch has been added/updated:  Patch Name: cgi.diff Revision:   1335984315 URL:        <https://bugs.php.net/patch-display.php?bug=61910&patch=cgi.diff&revision=1335984315>  ``` **[2012-05-03 13:00 UTC] [rasmus@php.net](//people.php.net/rasmus)** ``` And for people not able to update/apply a patch, this mod_rewrite condition and  rule should take care of it for Apache users:      RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(%2d|-)[^=]+$ [NC]     RewriteRule ^(.*) $1?

What the Hell...  ``` **[2012-05-04 18:41 UTC] neweracracker at gmail dot com** ``` I wonder why PHP-5.3.12 head wasn't merged with PHP-5.3 yet. Also PHP-5.4.2 head wasn't merged with PHP-5.4.  ``` **[2012-05-04 18:54 UTC] neweracracker at gmail dot com** ``` I wonder what is the consequence of doing something like ?-s+%3d ('%3d' is the encoded form of '='.  ``` **[2012-05-05 12:26 UTC] adedov at parallels dot com** ``` When ?-T+10000 problem will be fixed?  ``` **[2012-05-05 21:07 UTC] tyukish at parallels dot com** ``` you forgot to check in second block for 'T'. it is corrected in attached patch: CVE-2012-1823.patch  ``` **[2012-05-05 21:18 UTC] tyukish at parallels dot com** ``` just for clear: I told about following case:   <http://www.php-security.net/archives/9-New-PHP-CGI-exploit-CVE-2012-1823.html>  DoS with “?-T+100000” (careful, this will DoS your browser rendering engine too,  so you should do this via cURL)  ``` **[2012-05-05 21:21 UTC] [rasmus@php.net](//people.php.net/rasmus)** ``` ?-T+10000 is fixed by the original patch because it blocks anything starting with  - and not containing a =  ``` **[2012-05-05 21:23 UTC] [stas@php.net](//people.php.net/stas)** ``` Attached patch fixes only part of the problem, since many setups use shell  wrappers where various other shenanigans are possible.

I see only 3 blocks where parsed OPTs, first and second are safe through new  condition, 3rd block is safe through "if (!cgi && !fastcgi)" condition.  Thanks.  ``` **[2012-05-05 22:27 UTC] [rasmus@php.net](//people.php.net/rasmus)** ``` Ah, you mean for the fastcgi case. In what sort of configuration can those args  even get to fastcgi?

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate

## [PHP 5.4.3 and PHP 5.3.13 Released!](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-08-1)

08-May-2012

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate
availability of PHP 5.4.3 and PHP 5.3.13. All users are encouraged
to upgrade to PHP 5.4.3 or PHP 5.3.13

The releases complete a fix for a [vulnerability](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-03-1)
in CGI-based setups (CVE-2012-2311). *Note: mod\_php and php-fpm are not vulnerable to this attack.*

PHP 5.4.3 fixes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
[apache\_request\_headers()](http://php.net/manual/function.apache-request-headers.php) (CVE-2012-2329).
The PHP 5.3 series is not vulnerable to this issue.

For source downloads of PHP 5.4.3 and PHP 5.3.13 please visit our [downloads page](http://www.php.net/downloads.php),
Windows binaries can be found on [windows.php.net/download/](http://windows.php.net/download/).
The list of changes are recorded in the [ChangeLog](http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php).

## [PHP 5.3.12 and 5.4.2 and the CGI flaw (CVE-2012-1823)](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-06-1)

06-May-2012

PHP 5.3.12/5.4.2 do not fix all variations of the CGI issues described
in CVE-2012-1823. It has also come to our attention that some sites use
an insecure cgiwrapper script to run PHP. These scripts will use **$\***
instead of **"$@"** to pass parameters to php-cgi which causes a number of
issues. Again, people using mod\_php or php-fpm are not affected.

One way to address these CGI issues is to reject the request if the query string
contains a '-' and no '='. It can be done using Apache's mod\_rewrite like this:
```

    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^[^=]*$
    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} %2d|\- [NC]
    RewriteRule .? - [F,L]

```
Note that this will block otherwise safe requests like ?top-40 so if you
have query parameters that look like that, adjust your regex accordingly.

Another set of releases are planned for Tuesday, May, 8th. These
releases will fix the CGI flaw and another CGI-related issue in
apache\_request\_header (5.4 only).

We apologize for the inconvenience created with these releases and the
(lack of) communication around them.

## [PHP 5.3.12 and PHP 5.4.2 Released!](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-03-1)

03-May-2012

There is a vulnerability in certain CGI-based setups **(Apache+mod\_php and nginx+php-fpm are not affected)**
that has gone unnoticed for at least 8 years. [Section
7 of the CGI spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-robinson-www-interface-00#section-7) states:

Some systems support a method for supplying a [sic] array of strings to the
CGI script. This is only used in the case of an `indexed' query. This
is identified by a "GET" or "HEAD" HTTP request with a URL search
string not containing any unencoded "=" characters.

So, requests that do not have a "=" in the query string are treated
differently from those who do in some CGI implementations. For PHP this
means that a request containing ?-s may dump the PHP source code for the
page, but a request that has ?-s&=1 is fine.

A large number of sites run PHP as either an Apache module through
mod\_php or using php-fpm under nginx. Neither of these setups are
vulnerable to this. Straight shebang-style CGI also does not appear to
be vulnerable.

If you are using Apache mod\_cgi to run PHP you may be vulnerable. To see
if you are, just add ?-s to the end of any of your URLs. If you see your
source code, you are vulnerable. If your site renders normally, you are not.

To fix this, update to PHP 5.3.12 or PHP 5.4.2.

We recognize that since CGI is a rather outdated way to run PHP, it may not be feasible to
upgrade these sites to a modern version of PHP. An alternative is to
configure your web server to not let these types of requests with query
strings starting with a "-" and not containing a "=" through. Adding a
rule like this should not break any sites. For Apache using mod\_rewrite
it would look like this:

```

         RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^(%2d|-)[^=]+$ [NC]
         RewriteRule ^(.*) $1? [L]

```

If you are writing your own rule, be sure to take the urlencoded ?%2ds
version into account.

Making a bad week worse, we had a bug in our bug system that toggled the
private flag of a bug report to public on a comment to the bug report
causing this issue to go public before we had time to test solutions to
the level we would like. Please report any issues via [bugs.php.net](https://bugs.php.net/).

The PHP development team would like to announce the 2nd
[release candidate](http://qa.php.net) of PHP 5.4.1.
Windows binaries can be downloaded from the
[Windows QA site](http://windows.php.net/qa/).

**THIS IS A RELEASE CANDIDATE - DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION!**

This is the 2nd release candidate. The release candidate phase is
intended as a period of bug fixing prior to the stable release.
The release candidate fixes a critical issue when using the internal
classes in multiple threads.

A complete list of changes since the last release candidate can be
found in the

## [PHP migrates to Git](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-03-20-1)

20-Mar-2012

The migration of the PHP source code from Subversion to Git is complete.
You can clone or fork the source from our
[GitHub](https://github.com/php/php-src), and we also
now support pull requests made via GitHub, and full instructions
on cloning the php-src tree can be found at
[php.net/git](http://php.net/git).

One immediate benefit is that future PHP release tags will be signed by
the PHP development team. We will be releasing GPG keys for verification
purposes in the next few days.

More information on the migration and the new workflow can be found at the
[Moving to Git FAQ](https://wiki.php.net/vcs/gitfaq) on the PHP
Wiki.

Please note that the PHP manual, including translations, continues to be
hosted in Subversion for the time being and will be migrated to Git at a
later date.

Many thanks to David Soria Parra for his hard work on making the conversion
to Git a reality, and to Alexander Moskaliov, Florian Anderiasch and
Johannes Schlüter for their work on the scripts required to support
the conversion. Let the forking begin!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## PHP-CGI query string parameter vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#520827

Original Release Date: 2012-05-03 | Last Revised: 2013-12-02

---

### Overview

PHP-CGI-based setups contain a vulnerability when parsing query string parameters from php files.

### Description

| According to PHP's [website](http://php.net/), "PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML." When PHP is used in a CGI-based setup (such as Apache's mod\_cgid), the php-cgi receives a processed query string parameter as command line arguments which allows command-line switches, such as -s, -d or -c to be passed to the php-cgi binary, which can be exploited to disclose source code and obtain arbitrary code execution.  An example of the -s command, allowing an attacker to view the source code of index.php is below:<http://localhost/index.php?-s>Additional information can be found in the vulnerability reporter's [blog post](http://eindbazen.net/2012/05/php-cgi-advisory-cve-2012-1823/). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker could obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service condition or may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply update**PHP has released version [5.4.3](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-08-1) and [5.3.13](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-08-1) to address this vulnerability. PHP is recommending that users upgrade to the latest version of PHP.PHP has stated, *PHP 5.3.12/5.4.2 do not fix all variations of the CGI issues described in CVE-2012-1823. It has also come to our attention that some sites use an insecure cgiwrapper script to run PHP. These scripts will use $\* instead of "$@" to pass parameters to php-cgi which causes a number of issues.* |
| --- |

| **Apply mod\_rewrite rule***PHP has* [*stated*](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-03-1) *an alternative is to configure your web server to not let these types of requests with query strings starting with a "-" and not containing a "=" through. Adding a rule like this should not break any sites. For Apache using mod\_rewrite it would look like this*:    RewriteCond %{QUERY\_STRING} ^[^=]\*$    RewriteCond %{QUERY\_STRING} %2d|\- [NC]    RewriteRule .? - [F,L] |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| According to PHP's [website](http://www.php.net/archive/2012.php#id2012-05-03-1) *Apache+mod\_php and nginx+php-fpm are not affected.* |
