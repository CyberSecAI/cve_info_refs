- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM XIV Storage Systems have maintenance accounts with fixed passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Fixed/hardcoded passwords for maintenance accounts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to the system via maintenance accounts. The exact impact from this access is not specified, but it could lead to a range of malicious activities depending on the privileges associated with those accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the IBM XIV Storage System.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to gain network access to the system and know the hardcoded password for maintenance accounts.
