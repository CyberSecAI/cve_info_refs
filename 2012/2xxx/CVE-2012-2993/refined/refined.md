- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Windows Phone 7 fails to check the Common Name (CN) of server certificates when sending or receiving emails over SSL using POP3/IMAP/SMTP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper certificate validation, specifically the absence of CN verification.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept login credentials and session data for protocols like SMTP, POP3, etc.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks between the Windows Phone 7 device and the email server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to perform a MITM attack, placing themselves in the network path between the phone and the mail server.
