- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization within the T-dah Webmail Client. Specifically, the email body field allows injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The injected script is stored by the application and executed every time a user views the crafted email.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webmail client, allowing them to potentially:
    - Steal session cookies, hijack user accounts, or perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the webmail client
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through sending a specially crafted email to a vulnerable T-dah Webmail client. The crafted email includes malicious Javascript within the body of the email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send email to a user of the vulnerable T-dah Webmail Client. They do not need to have any special access or knowledge of the vulnerable server other than the email address of the victim. The attacker can be remote.
