Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way JIRA uses third-party XML parsers. This insecure usage allows for the execution of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of XML parsing
- Vulnerable third-party XML parsers

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) attacks against the JIRA server.
- JIRA service unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated JIRA user can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted XML data to the JIRA server, triggering the flawed parsing mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of JIRA.

**Affected Versions:**
- All versions of JIRA up to and including 5.0.0.
- The Tempo and Gliffy for JIRA plugins are also vulnerable to this exploit in any version of JIRA.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to JIRA 5.0.1 or later.
- Disable public access to JIRA (anonymous access and public signup).
- Apply the provided patches for specific JIRA versions.
- Upgrade the vulnerable third-party plugins (Tempo and Gliffy).
