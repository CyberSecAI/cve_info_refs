Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-2277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The identified vulnerabilities stem from flaws in the EMC IRM License Server's handling of specific commands and version checks. These include:

*   **A] "version compat check" \*FIPS NULL pointer:** Missing `*FIPS` fields in the "version compatibility check" command trigger a NULL pointer dereference.
*   **B] Freezing caused by multiple commands:** Sending continuous, malformed commands, like "batch begin untethered" with an ID containing line feeds, leads to process freezing.
*  **C] NULL pointer caused by commands after invalid version:** Sending commands after an initial "version compat check" with an invalid version can trigger NULL pointer dereferences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereferences:** Several attack vectors lead to NULL pointer dereferences, causing the server to crash or become unusable.
*   **Resource Exhaustion/Freezing:** Malformed commands can cause the server process to freeze and consume excessive resources.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The server does not properly validate the input of the "version compat check" command or other commands, particularly with regards to the presence of the `*FIPS` field and malformed identifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The primary impact of these vulnerabilities is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Exploitation renders the IRM server unusable, even though the `pvcontrol.exe` process remains active. This prevents authorized users from accessing protected content and using the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, allowing attackers to trigger the DoS without requiring local access.
*   **Network-based attacks:** Attackers send specifically crafted commands to the vulnerable server through network communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable EMC IRM License Server.
*   The attacker must be able to send network commands to the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects EMC IRM License Server versions 4.6.1.1995 and earlier.
*   The exploit involves sending specially crafted network commands to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available.
*   A fix was later released by EMC.
