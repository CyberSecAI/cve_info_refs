How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1144188#c0)  Matthew Harmsen    2014-09-18 23:44:41 UTC  ``` During the TPS testing of the 'pki-core' component for the RHEL 6.6 errata, a failure occurred when the TPS rebuild test failed with the following error:       com/netscape/ca/CAService.java:642: error: reference to Extension is ambiguous, both interface java.security.cert.Extension in java.security.cert and class netscape.security.x509.Extension in netscape.security.x509 match                         Extension ext = (Extension) e.nextElement();                         ^     com/netscape/ca/CAService.java:642: error: reference to Extension is ambiguous, both interface java.security.cert.Extension in java.security.cert and class netscape.security.x509.Extension in netscape.security.x509 match                         Extension ext = (Extension) e.nextElement();  This was due to the use of "wildcards" in the import statements of the source code contained in the RHEL 6 maintenance branch (a problem that has been alleviated in newer versions of the product):      . . .     import netscape.security.x509.*;     import netscape.security.util.BigInt;     import netscape.security.util.*;     import java.security.cert.*;     . . .  For the purposes of RHEL 6.7, we should apply the following minimal fix so that the TPS tests will succeed:  diff --git a/base/ca/src/com/netscape/ca/CAService.java b/base/ca/src/com/netscape/ca/CAService.java index a63391d..43bb3dd 100644 --- a/base/ca/src/com/netscape/ca/CAService.java +++ b/base/ca/src/com/netscape/ca/CAService.java @@ -639,7 +639,7 @@ public class CAService implements ICAService, IService {                      Enumeration e = exts.getElements();                        while (e.hasMoreElements()) { -                        Extension ext = (Extension) e.nextElement(); +                        netscape.security.x509.Extension ext = (netscape.security.x509.Extension) e.nextElement();                            if (ext.getExtensionId().toString().equals(PKIXExtensions.BasicConstraints_Id.toString())) {                              bc_ext = (BasicConstraintsExtension) ext;   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1144188#c2)  Ade Lee    2014-09-19 03:18:42 UTC  ``` The issue is stated as follows: com/netscape/ca/CAService.java:642: error: reference to Extension is ambiguous, both interface java.security.cert.Extension in java.security.cert and class netscape.security.x509.Extension in netscape.security.x509 match Extension ext = (Extension) e.nextElement();  This never used to be a problem before because java.security.cert.Extension was only introduced in Java 7.  This also won't be a problem unless java.security.cert.Extension is found in the classpath before netscape.security.x509.Extension.  If it is though, and ext is instantiated as a netscape.security.x509.Extension, then some subsequent calls - like ext.getExtensionId() will fail.  Now, this code is in a function called issueX509Cert() - which sounds like its pretty important.  In fact, I suspect its executed whenever we issue a cert.    Thats a double edged sword -- we know that we have not had any  issues - so its likely that the classpath is set up correctly.  On the other hand, do we want to rely on this for such an important bit of code?  Remember that classpath issues are notoriously difficult to debug.  Incidentally, on looking at this code, I think that Matt's initial solution needs to be tweaked a bit, so that the Enumeration is also typed -- ie.  Enumeration e = exts.getElements();  should become Enumeration<netscape.security.x509.Extension> e = exts.getElements();   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1144188#c3)  Nathan Kinder    2014-09-19 14:51:08 UTC  ``` Proposing this as a 0day for RHEL 6.6.z based off of the description in [comment#2](show_bug.cgi?id=1144188#c2).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

The bug occurred due to a problem in a previous version of IdM where the subsystem user, created during the initial CA server installation, was removed together with the initial master. This update adds the restore-subsystem-user.py script that restores the subsystem user in the described situation, thus enabling administrators to create a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 replica in this scenario. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Clones: | [1225603](show_bug.cgi?id=1225603 "CLOSED NOTABUG - unable to create rhel 7.1 replica from rhel 6 replica CA because subsystem user does not exist")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=1225603)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2015-07-22 06:55:47 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1225589#c0)  Ade Lee    2015-05-27 18:04:32 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  This is a little complicated.  The scenario is as follows:  1. Create CA-0 on RHEL  6.6 (Dogtag 9) 2. Create CA-1 on RHEL 6.6 as replica of CA-0 3. Remove CA-0 (using pkiremove) 4. Create CA-2 as replica of CA-1 on RHEL 7.1 (Dogtag 10)    Step 4 fails in the UpdateDomainXML step, because the subsystem user no longer exists and therefore cannot be used for authentication.  In more detail:  1. In step 1 above, a user is created :     uid=CA-<master_host>-<nmaster_port>, ou=People, $suffix    which uses the CA subsystem cert as its cert.  2. In step 2, no new user is created because a user already exists which uses    the subsystem cert.  We want to be sure that only one user exists with a     given cert.   3. In step 3, pkiremove contacts CA-0 (itself) calling updateDomainXML to    remove the server's entry from the security domain.  It also removes the user    created in step 1.  At this point - because the change is replicated through    the DB to CA-1, there is no subsystem user available.  4. In step 4, we attempt to make a call to updateDomainXML.  We attempt to do    this on the admin port using an install token, but this fails because the    RHEL 6 CA-1 does not serve the newer servlets on the admin port.  We then     fall back to the agent port which requires client authentication.  We     attempt to use the subsystem cert as auth, but fail because no subsystem     user exists.  Thus, the replica creation process fails.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1225589#c2)  Endi Sukma Dewata    2015-05-29 03:40:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1031566](attachment.cgi?id=1031566&action=diff "Patch for RHEL 6.6 branch of pki-core") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1031566&action=edit "Patch for RHEL 6.6 branch of pki-core") Patch for RHEL 6.6 branch of pki-core  Scratch build: <https://brewweb.devel.redhat.com/taskinfo?taskID=9277013>  To run the script: $ python /usr/share/pki/scripts/restore-subsystem-user.py   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1225589#c3)  Endi Sukma Dewata    2015-05-30 02:10:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1032345](attachment.cgi?id=1032345&action=diff "Patch for RHEL 6.7 branch of pki-core") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1032345&action=edit "Patch for RHEL 6.7 branch of pki-core") Patch for RHEL 6.7 branch of pki-core   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1225589#c4)  Endi Sukma Dewata    2015-06-03 00:11:41 UTC  ``` ACKed by alee.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1103)

## Topic

Updated pki-common, pki-tps and pki-util packages that fix multiple
security issues and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
Certificate System 8.1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software system designed to
manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were discovered in the Red Hat
Certificate System Agent and End Entity pages. An attacker could use these
flaws to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims using
Certificate System's web interface. (CVE-2012-2662)

It was discovered that Red Hat Certificate System's Certificate Manager
did not properly check certificate revocation requests performed via its
web interface. An agent permitted to perform revocations of end entity
certificates could use this flaw to revoke the Certificate Authority (CA)
certificate. (CVE-2012-3367)

This update also adds the following enhancement:

* Red Hat Certificate System 8.1 did not previously allow using Red Hat

Directory Server 9.0 as its internal database. This update adds support
for Directory Server 9.0. (BZ#547527, BZ#819508)

All users of Red Hat Certificate System 8.1 are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages, which correct these issues and add this enhancement.
After installing this update, all Red Hat Certificate System subsystems
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=547527#c0)  Ade Lee    2009-12-14 21:12:25 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Several problems: 1. The certificateRecord object has an attribute "subject" which used to be defined in the 28pilot.ldif schema.  Due to changes to update this schema, the subject attribute has been removed.  We need to either  a) find a replacement attribute outside the CS schema b) define a custom attribute within CS schema c) remove the attribute  An exhaustive search through the code and existing databases indicates that this attribute is not used.  Therefore, we propose to remove this attribute from the schema's.  2. If Syntax checking is enabled on the DS, all kinds of problems arise when we attempt to save the empty string "" for certain attributes.  In particular, this arises in two cases (that we know of):  a) when making a request (with some fields missing). The attributes ext-* adorn the request object which has extensibleObject as an auxiliary class.  These classes use Directory String (which is 1*UTF) in the syntax checker.  This will be changed in DS to use OctetString instead (which is *UTF).  Until this is available, disable syntax checking on the DS.  b) When doing the installation, we try to save "" for the telephone Number of the admin user .. We need to put in a dummy variable here.  c) there may be more of this kind of issue ..     Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3.    Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=547527#c2)  Ade Lee    2009-12-16 15:24:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 378777](attachment.cgi?id=378777&action=diff "patch to fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=378777&action=edit "patch to fix") patch to fix  patch removes subject field. and adds checks in places where DS syntax is required (mostly for user creation).  awnuk, please review.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=547527#c3)  Ade Lee    2009-12-17 02:52:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 378882](attachment.cgi?id=378882&action=diff "patch to fix (version 2)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=378882&action=edit "patch to fix (version 2)") patch to fix (version 2)  On discussion with awnuk, correct practice is to not store a value when the value is an empty string (rather than store a space).  The updated patch does that.  In particular:  In DonePanel.java, we throw an exception because the parameter "name" is a MUST parameter.  In UGSubsystem.java, for telephoneNumber and userState, we do not store the values at all if the values are "".  This is OK because when the values are read from the db, we set these parameters to "" in the User object if the attribute is not defined.  For userType (which is a MUST parameter), we store the value "undefined" if the value is "".  When the value is read, we set the value to "" in the User object if the value read is not defined or is "undefined".  Thus, the change here is transparent to any level above the db layer.  In UpdateDomainXML .. we simply error out if any required parameters are missing and create an error accordingly.  Migration steps for users with old data will be posted in a separate comment to this bug.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=547527#c4)  Ade Lee    2009-12-17 06:46:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 378910](attachment.cgi?id=378910&action=diff "patch to fix (v3)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=378910&action=edit "patch to fix (v3)") patch to fix (v3)  Fixed a couple of issues that occur on modifying the user.  Also fixed a console issue - the user state was not modifiable.  Now it is. Incidentally, users created by console do not have option to select user type - nor can they be modified.  Not going to fix this here .. sigh ..   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=547527#c5)  Ade Lee    2009-12-17 06:48:46 UTC  ``` Oops - ignore the selinux changes ..

## Synopsis

Moderate: pki-core security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1347)

## Topic

Updated pki-core packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Red Hat Certificate System is an enterprise software system designed to
manage enterprise public key infrastructure (PKI) deployments. PKI Core
contains fundamental packages required by Red Hat Certificate System, which
comprise the Certificate Authority (CA) subsystem.

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were discovered in the Red Hat
Certificate System Agent and End Entity pages. An attacker could use these
flaws to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims using
the Certificate System's web interface. (CVE-2012-2662)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, pki-core required the SSL version 3 (SSLv3) protocol ranges

to communicate with the 389-ds-base packages. However, recent changes to
389-ds-base disabled the default use of SSLv3 and enforced using protocol
ranges supported by secure protocols, such as the TLS protocol. As a
consequence, the CA failed to install during an Identity Management (IdM)
server installation. This update adds TLS-related parameters to the
server.xml file of the CA to fix this problem, and running the
ipa-server-install command now installs the CA as expected. (BZ#1171848)

* Previously, the ipa-server-install script failed when attempting to

configure a stand-alone CA on systems with OpenJDK version 1.8.0 installed.
The pki-core build and runtime dependencies have been modified to use
OpenJDK version 1.7.0 during the stand-alone CA configuration. As a result,
ipa-server-install no longer fails in this situation. (BZ#1212557)

* Creating a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 replica from a Red Hat Enterprise

Linux 6 replica running the CA service sometimes failed in IdM deployments
where the initial Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 CA master had been removed.
This could cause problems in some situations, such as when migrating from
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. The bug occurred
due to a problem in a previous version of IdM where the subsystem user,
created during the initial CA server installation, was removed together
with the initial master. This update adds the restore-subsystem-user.py
script that restores the subsystem user in the described situation, thus
enabling administrators to create a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 replica in
this scenario. (BZ#1225589)

* Several Java import statements specify wildcard arguments. However, due

to the use of wildcard arguments in the import statements of the source
code contained in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 maintenance branch, a name
space collision created the potential for an incorrect class to be
utilized. As a consequence, the Token Processing System (TPS) rebuild test
failed with an error message. This update addresses the bug by supplying
the fully named class in all of the affected areas, and the TPS rebuild
test no longer fails. (BZ#1144188)

* Previously, pki-core failed to build with the rebased version of the

CMake build system during the TPS rebuild test. The pki-core build files
have been updated to comply with the rebased version of CMake. As a result,
pki-core builds successfully in the described scenario. (BZ#1144608)

Users of pki-core are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
