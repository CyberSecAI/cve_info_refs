Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2012-2336:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, particularly from lists.opensuse.org and bugzilla.novell.com, explicitly mentions CVE-2012-2336 alongside a description of the vulnerability. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way PHP's command-line options are handled within CGI scripts. Specifically, unsanitized command-line options passed through the query string can lead to crashes of the PHP interpreter. This indicates a lack of proper input validation and sanitization.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is improper filtering of command-line options passed to the PHP interpreter when used as a CGI binary. The vulnerability allows for:
    *   Potential crashes of the PHP interpreter due to the injection of malicious command-line arguments.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of service (DoS) due to the PHP interpreter crashing.
    *  The openSUSE security update indicates that it "could lead to crashes of the php interpreter." This highlights the denial of service potential of this vulnerability.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through crafted URLs that pass malicious command-line options within the query string.
    *   The vulnerability is specifically applicable to CGI-based setups (e.g., using `mod_cgi` in Apache), which is noted in multiple sources.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable server.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, making this vulnerability easily exploitable.

**3. Additional Notes**
*   The content indicates that this CVE is related to CVE-2012-2335, suggesting a similar vulnerability.
*   The provided openSUSE mailing list entries indicate that fixes for CVE-2012-2336 were bundled with fixes for other vulnerabilities such as CVE-2012-2335, CVE-2012-2386 and CVE-2012-2143.

**4. Technical Details:**

*   The `sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c` patch from bugs.php.net shows that the fix involves checking the `QUERY_STRING` environment variable for a leading hyphen (`-`) and ensuring it also contains an equals sign (`=`), effectively filtering out query strings that could be interpreted as command-line options.
*   The patch also uses `php_url_decode` to decode the query string before performing the check.
*   The patch also uses a `skip_getopt` variable to prevent parsing the query string if it's deemed malicious.
* The bug report #61910 indicates that this issue relates to other CGI related vulnerabilities that were found as well.
