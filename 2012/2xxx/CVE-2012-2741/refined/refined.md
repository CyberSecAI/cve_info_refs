Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-2741:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the phpList application. Specifically, the 'sortby' parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries, and the 'num' parameter is not sanitized before being displayed in the web page, allowing for SQL injection and XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The `sortby` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection, as it allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code into database queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `num` parameter is vulnerable to XSS, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code, which will be executed within the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, data manipulation, and potentially complete compromise of the application's database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful XSS exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the victim's browser, session hijacking, defacement of the website, phishing attempts, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The SQL injection vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `sortby` parameter within a URL request.
*  **XSS:** The XSS vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious code within the `num` parameter of a URL request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable phpList instance.
*  The attacker must target an authenticated administrator session for the XSS attack.
*   No special privileges are required for exploiting the SQLi.
*  The exploit can be conducted remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is in phplist before version 2.10.18.
*   The vendor classified this vulnerability as "intermediate" due to the requirement that the administrator be logged in to exploit it.
*   The advisory IDs are ZSL-2012-5081.
*  The vulnerabilities were discovered by Gjoko Krstic.
*   The advisory also references CVE-2012-2740, which is related to the same vulnerability in the 'sortby' parameter causing a different kind of issue.
*   The vendor released version 2.10.18 to address this issue.
