Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the Linux kernel's hugetlb (huge pages) subsystem. Specifically, when an anonymous (non-shared) mapping using huge pages fails during the `mmap()` operation, a memory reservation made by `hugetlb_reserve_pages()` through `resv_map_alloc()` isn't properly released.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The core issue is that memory allocated for the huge page reservation is not freed when the `mmap()` call fails.
*   **Incorrect Error Handling:** The `mmap()` failure path uses `unmap_region()` which doesn't call `remove_vma()`, which would release the reservation. The code relies on `vm_ops->close()` to handle the release, but this is not triggered in the failure scenario.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unprivileged local user can repeatedly trigger the mmap failure and cause a memory leak, eventually leading to system instability and a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is local. An unprivileged user needs to execute code on the target system.
*   **`mmap()` System Call:** The user must be able to trigger the `mmap()` system call with parameters that cause a failure, leading to the memory leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker must be able to run arbitrary code to invoke the `mmap()` system call repeatedly.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need root or administrative privileges to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is in the hugetlb memory subsystem which is part of the kernel's memory management.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the reservation is released when a failure occurs during the `mmap()` process.
*   The patch addresses the memory leak by introducing a `resv_map_put()` function to ensure the resource is freed even in the error path.
*   The vulnerability was present in Linux kernel versions prior to the fix. The fixes were backported to older kernel versions.
