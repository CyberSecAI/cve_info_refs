Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-2196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability exists in the `GET_WRAP_CFG_C` and `GET_WRAP_CFG_C2` functions within IBM DB2. These functions allow unauthorized access to XML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** The primary weakness is that these functions permit access to XML files without proper authorization checks. This suggests a lack of access control mechanisms or their improper implementation in the functions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to read sensitive information stored in the XML files, potentially including configuration details, user data, or other sensitive content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** Although not explicitly stated if it is a local or remote attack vector, the vulnerability is listed as a "Security" issue and is fixed across multiple platforms. It can be assumed that this is remotely exploitable.
*   **Database Function Abuse:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `GET_WRAP_CFG_C` and `GET_WRAP_CFG_C2` functions. An attacker would need to find a way to execute these functions with malicious intent to expose the XML files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **DB2 Access:** An attacker would need some form of access or ability to interact with the DB2 database instance, or the ability to call these functions remotely. This could be achieved with stolen credentials, exploiting another vulnerability to gain access, or through an interface that exposes these functions.
* **Knowledge of Function:** The attacker would need to have knowledge of the vulnerable `GET_WRAP_CFG_C` and `GET_WRAP_CFG_C2` functions and be able to invoke them.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by the fix pack for DB2 versions 9.1, 9.5, 9.7, 9.8 and 10.1
*   The vulnerability is identified by the APAR number IC84614 for v9.1
