        "content": "### TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2897\n\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected components handle a specially crafted TrueType font file. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted TrueType font file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.\n\nTo view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-2897](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-2897).\n\n#### Mitigating Factors for TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2897\n\nMitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:\n\n*   In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.\n*   By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables font download by default. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario. The vulnerability could also be exploited if a user opens an attachment that is sent in an email message.\n*   The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n#### Workarounds for TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2897\n\nMicrosoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\n#### FAQ for TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2012-2897\n\n**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**\n\nThis is a remote code execution vulnerability\n\n**What causes the vulnerability?**\n\nThe vulnerability is caused when Windows fails to properly handle specially crafted TrueType Fonts (TTF).\n\n**What is TrueType?**\n\nTrueType is a digital font technology used in Microsoft operating systems.\n\n**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.\n\n**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**\n\nThere are multiple means that could allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nIn a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.\n\nIn a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.\n\n**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**\n\nWorkstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk.\n\n**What does the update do?**\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way Windows handles specially crafted TrueType Font files.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**\n\nNo. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\n\n**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**\n\nNo. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.",
