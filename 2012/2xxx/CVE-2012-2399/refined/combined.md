# WordPress 3.5.2 Maintenance and Security Release

---

WordPress 3.5.2 is now available. This is the second maintenance release of 3.5, fixing [12 bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=3.5.2). **This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.** The WordPress security team resolved seven security issues, and this release also contains some additional security hardening.

The security fixes included:

* Blocking server-side request forgery attacks, which could potentially enable an attacker to gain access to a site.
* Disallow contributors from improperly publishing posts, reported by [Konstantin Kovshenin](http://kovshenin.com/), or reassigning the post’s authorship, reported by [Luke Bryan](http://www.sharefaith.com/).
* An update to the SWFUpload external library to fix cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Reported by [mala](http://ma.la) and [Szymon Gruszecki](http://mars.iti.pk.edu.pl/~grucha/). (Developers: More on SWFUpload [here](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/06/21/secure-swfupload/).)
* Prevention of a denial of service attack, affecting sites using password-protected posts.
* An update to an external TinyMCE library to fix a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Reported by [Wan Ikram](http://twitter.com/rinakikun).
* Multiple fixes for cross-site scripting. Reported by [Andrea Santese](http://webapplicationsecurity.altervista.org/) and Rodrigo.
* Avoid disclosing a full file path when a upload fails. Reported by [Jakub Galczyk](http://hauntit.blogspot.de/).

We appreciated [responsible disclosure](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security) of these issues directly to our security team. For more information on the changes, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5.2) or consult [the list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.5?rev=24498&stop_rev=23347).

[Download WordPress 3.5.2](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.5.2.zip) or update now from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

*Also:* **WordPress 3.6 Beta 4:** If you are testing WordPress 3.6, please note that [WordPress 3.6 Beta 4](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.6-beta4.zip) (zip) includes fixes for these security issues.

Debian Bug     : 670124

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool.  As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead
of backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2+dfsg-1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

# WordPress 3.3.2 (and WordPress 3.4 Beta 3)

---

[WordPress 3.3.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) is available now and is a security update for all previous versions.

Three external libraries included in WordPress received security updates:

* Plupload (version 1.5.4), which WordPress uses for uploading media.
* SWFUpload, which WordPress previously used for uploading media, and may still be in use by plugins.
* SWFObject, which WordPress previously used to embed Flash content, and may still be in use by plugins and themes.

Thanks to [Neal Poole](https://nealpoole.com/blog/) and [Nathan Partlan](http://greywhind.wordpress.com/) for [responsibly disclosing](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security) the bugs in Plupload and SWFUpload, and [Szymon Gruszecki](http://mars.iti.pk.edu.pl/~grucha/) for a separate bug in SWFUpload.

WordPress 3.3.2 also addresses:

* Limited privilege escalation where a site administrator could deactivate network-wide plugins when running a WordPress network under particular circumstances, disclosed by [Jon Cave](http://joncave.co.uk/) of our WordPress core security team, and [Adam Backstrom](http://sixohthree.com/).
* Cross-site scripting vulnerability when making URLs clickable, by Jon Cave.
* Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in redirects after posting comments in older browsers, and when filtering URLs. Thanks to [Mauro Gentile](http://www.sneaked.net/) for responsibly disclosing these issues to the security team.

These issues were fixed by the WordPress core security team. Five other bugs were also fixed in version 3.3.2. Consult the [change log](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.3?rev=20552&stop_rev=20087) for more details.

[Download WordPress 3.3.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) or update now from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

---

### WordPress 3.4 Beta 3 also available

Our development of WordPress 3.4 development continues. Today we are proud to release Beta 3 for testing. [Nearly 90 changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk?rev=20552&stop_rev=20450) have been made since Beta 2, released 9 days ago. (We are aiming for a beta every week.)

This is still beta software, so **we don’t recommend that you use it on production sites**. But if you’re a plugin developer, a theme developer, or a site administrator, **you should be running this on your test environments** and [reporting any bugs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs) you find. (See the [known issues here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5).) If you’re a WordPress user who wants to open your presents early, take advantage of WordPress’s famous 5-minute install and spin up a secondary test site. [Let us know what you think](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta)!

Version 3.4 Beta 3 includes all of the fixes included in version 3.3.2. [Download WordPress 3.4 Beta 3](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.4-beta3.zip) or use the [WordPress Beta Tester](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) plugin.

# Announcing a secure SWFUpload fork

The WordPress security team has officially forked the [long-abandoned SWFUpload project](https://code.google.com/p/swfupload/) and is strongly encouraging all web developers who use SWFUpload to update.

**We strongly suggest you do not use SWFUpload. But if you must, use this fork.** You can find it on GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the ‘pull request’ where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner. <https://github.com/> at [github.com/wordpress/secure-swfupload](http://github.com/wordpress/secure-swfupload).

WordPress does *not* use SWFUpload, but we continue to include it in WordPress coreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. for plugins that have yet to be updated to use [Plupload](http://plupload.com/), our upload library of choice. Plupload is written and actively maintained by [Moxiecode](http://www.moxiecode.com/), the developers of [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/).

We do not condone the use of abandonware. We only wish to make the web a better place by ensuring that developers have access to a secure version of SWFUpload, when the only alternative may be to use insecure code.

This is a fork of SWFUpload 2.2.0.1 and includes cross-site scripting fixes that have been reported by Szymon Gruszecki (CVE-2013-2205 and CVE-2012-2399), and Neal Poole and Nathan Partlan (CVE-2012-3414). It also includes fixes from Yelp’s engineering team for CVE-2012-2399.

**WordPress 3.5.2**, [released moments ago](https://wordpress.org/news/2013/06/wordpress-3-5-2/), includes fixes for CVE-2013-2205 and CVE-2012-2399. WordPress 3.3.2 (2012-04-20) included a fix for CVE-2012-3414 and an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-2399.

**If you think you have found a vulnerability in this fork of SWFUpload, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.** Please email reports of security vulnerabilities to swfupload-security AT wordpress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization. <https://wordpress.org/>. These reports will be reviewed by the WordPress security team and by security researchers contributing to this project, including Neal and Szymon.

# 2.0.1 Release

---

It’s been exactly one month since we released [the well-received WordPress 2.0 release](https://wordpress.org/development/2005/12/wp2/). In the past 4 weeks we’ve been listening closely to feedback, squashing bugs wherever we find them, and watching how 2.0 handled under different loads.

We’ve rolled up all the most important fixes into a 2.0.1 release, [which is now available for download](https://wordpress.org/download/).

All in all [we’ve closed 114 bugs in the 2.0.1 release](https://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0.1), which you’re welcome to check out if you’re curious about every fix. To summarize:

* You can now specify an upload directory, and whether to use date-based storage or not.
* Caching has been fixed under certain PHP enviroments.
* Permalinks have been fixed for weird enviroments as well.
* XML-RPC uploading works.
* Compatibility with older versions of PHP.
* Several WYSIWYG fixes and cleanups.
* Imports now use much less memory.
* Now works with MySQL 5.0 in strict mode.

Happy blogging!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CS and XSS vulnerabilities in SWFUpload

---

*From*: "MustLive" <mustlive () websecurity com ua>

*Date*: Sun, 10 Mar 2013 20:57:05 +0200

---

```

Hello list!

```
These are Content Spoofing and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in
SWFUpload.
```

```
This is very popular flash-file, which is used at tens millions of web sites
and in hundreds of web applications (such as WordPress, only this web
application is used at more then 62 millions of web sites according to
wordpress.com).
```

```
Last year I've wrote about XSS vulnerability in swfupload in WordPress
(<http://securityvulns.ru/docs28759.html>) and in many other web applications.
Neal Poole wrote in April 2012, when he disclosed XSS vulnerability in one
swf-file in WordPress (CVE-2012-3414), that none developers of SWFUpload
support their software. This application is still not maintained. Earlier
I've informed two developers (on their e-mails) about these new
vulnerabilities, but without any response from them, which was predictable
due to Neal's experience.
```

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

```
Vulnerable are all versions of SWFUpload - SWFUpload v2.2.0.1 and previous
versions. And all web applications with affected versions of SWFUpload are
vulnerable. There are many such web applications, about many of them I've
wrote last year, like WordPress.
```

```
Vulnerable are versions WordPress 2.5 - 3.3.1. The fixed version of
swfupload.swf in WP 3.3.2 contain fix as for previous XSS, as for these CS
and XSS vulnerabilities.
```

```
File swfupload.swf is bundled with WordPress 2.7 - 3.3.1. File
swfupload\_f9.swf is bundled with WordPress 2.5 - 2.7.1. In versions WP 2.7 -
2.7.1 both flash-files are contained.
```

-----
Fix:
-----

Use swfupload.swf from WordPress 3.3.2 and higher versions.

----------
Details:
----------

```
There are different names of files of SWFUpload: swfupload.swf,
swfupload\_f9.swf, swfupload\_f8.swf, swfupload\_f10.swf and swfupload\_f11.swf.
All of them are vulnerable, except swfupload.swf bundled with WordPress
since version 3.3.2.
```

Content Spoofing (WASC-12):

<http://site/swfupload.swf?buttonText=test%3Cimg%20src=%27http://demo.swfupload.org/v220/images/logo.gif%27%3E>

It's possible to inject text, images and html (e.g. for link injection).

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

<http://site/swfupload.swf?buttonText=%3Ca%20href=%27javascript:alert>(document.cookie)%27%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS.

Best wishes & regards,

> CVE-2012-2399's only public details are that it's an unspecified vulnerability in Wordpress before 3.3.2, yet <http://wordpress.org/news/2012/04/wordpress-3-3-2/> is pretty vague and mentions multiple products (although it does credit Neal Poole for at least one issue).  That said, a statement by a lead developer of Wordpress is important for this clarification ;-)  Andrew, can you confirm for sure that CVE-2012-2399 is *also* the same as CVE-2012-3414 for Neal Poole's movieName vector?

Negative, I was mistaken. Sorry for the confusion. CVE-2012-2399 was a
separate XSS, affecting buttonText, and reported by Szymon Gruszecki.
CVE-2012-3414 was Neal Poole's report, affecting movieName.

So, CVE-2013-4145 is a duplicate of CVE-2012-3414, *not* of CVE-2012-2399.

That said, given that CVE-2012-2399 was not publicly described at the
time, I would not be surprised if one or more CVEs have been issued
for the same XSS via buttonText at one point.

Related, for those who haven't seen, WordPress forked SWFUpload last
month. Both Neal and Szymon have been helping us with the fork, as
well. At this point, in terms of issues known to us, only the image
injection issue is unfixed.
