Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2399:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found within the SWFUpload library, specifically in the handling of the `buttonText` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The SWFUpload component fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code. The `buttonText` parameter is vulnerable to this injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code via the `buttonText` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts within the user's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the web page
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
* **Content Spoofing:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML, text, and images by manipulating the `buttonText` parameter, which can be used for phishing or to mislead users by altering what they see on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes the `buttonText` parameter with the XSS payload.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The XSS is described as "strictly social XSS," which means the attacker relies on user interaction (clicking on the manipulated button) to trigger the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct URLs with the vulnerable `buttonText` parameter and distribute these URLs (e.g. through links, phishing campaigns).
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the victim to interact with the manipulated SWFUpload button (e.g., by clicking on it), as the XSS code is embedded in the button text, which the user would interact with.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of SWFUpload, except the version of swfupload.swf bundled with WordPress since version 3.3.2 (and later).
*   WordPress versions 2.5 to 3.3.1 were vulnerable before the fix was implemented in 3.3.2
*   The vulnerable SWFUpload files include: `swfupload.swf`, `swfupload_f9.swf`, `swfupload_f8.swf`, `swfupload_f10.swf`, and `swfupload_f11.swf`

**Mitigation:**
*   WordPress 3.3.2 includes a fix
*   WordPress created a fork of the SWFUpload project called "secure-swfupload" with fixes for the vulnerability which was included in WordPress 3.5.2 and later versions
