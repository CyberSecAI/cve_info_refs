Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Office handles specially crafted Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) graphics files. Specifically, it involves memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of CGM files leads to memory corruption, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- The vulnerability lies in the Microsoft Office component responsible for processing CGM files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit could grant the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including:
    - Installing programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creating new accounts with full user rights
- Users with fewer privileges will be less impacted, however, they could still be exposed to other malicious activity that an attacker may initiate on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker could send a specially crafted file containing malicious CGM data as an email attachment. A user opening the attachment would trigger the vulnerability.
- **Web-Based:** An attacker could host a website containing a malicious CGM file. If a user visits the site, the vulnerability could be exploited. This also includes compromised websites and sites that host user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Embedded CGM:** An attacker could embed a malicious CGM file within an Office document. Opening the document would exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote from the victim's system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to:
    - Open a specially crafted file (e.g., email attachment)
    - Visit a malicious website
    - Open a document containing an embedded malicious CGM file
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted CGM file.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the loading of CGM graphics files in affected Microsoft Office applications.
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010.
- The advisory also mentions defense-in-depth changes for Microsoft Office 2007 and 2010 to handle WordPerfect graphics (WPG) files properly.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index rated this vulnerability as "Exploitation More Likely" meaning exploit code could be created and that it has been seen in similar vulnerabilities.
