{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 389 Directory Server and Red Hat Directory Server stored the plaintext user password in the `unhashed#user#password` attribute, and this attribute was exposed to any authenticated user after a password change but before a server restart. The new password was also logged in plaintext in the audit logs when enabled.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Plaintext password storage in the `unhashed#user#password` attribute.",
    "Exposure of the `unhashed#user#password` attribute to authenticated users before server restart.",
     "Plaintext password logging in audit logs when enabled."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with the ability to bind to the directory server can obtain plaintext passwords of users who have changed their password, if the server has not been restarted since the change, and potentially obtain passwords of other users via audit logs.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker must be able to bind to the directory server to exploit the vulnerability. They can then either access the `unhashed#user#password` attribute directly or retrieve the password from the audit logs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network access to the directory server and possess valid credentials to authenticate to the server."
