| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-02-13 10:18:24 UTC  ``` An insufficient escape sequences sanitization flaw was found in the way xpdf, a PDF file viewer for the X window system, and poppler, a PDF rendering library, performed sanitization of certain characters to be displayed in the error messages, which arose during presentation of certain PDF files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify a window's title, or, possibly execute arbitrary commands or overwrite files, via a specially-crafted PDF file containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator if local, unsuspecting user opened such crafted PDF file in xpdf or in an application linked against poppler library (for example evince).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-02-13 10:33:07 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the poppler package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the poppler package, as shipped with Fedora release of 18 and 19.  --  This issue affects the versions of the xpdf package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 and Fedora EPEL 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the poppler package, as shipped with Fedora release of 18 and 19.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c22)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-26 15:53:45 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-2142](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2142) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c24)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-27 13:20:52 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Phillips Wolf for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c25)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 08:41:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 784759](attachment.cgi?id=784759&action=diff "Proposed poppler patch by Marek Kasik (against upstream poppler version)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=784759&action=edit "Proposed poppler patch by Marek Kasik (against upstream poppler version)") Proposed poppler patch by Marek Kasik (against upstream poppler version)   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c26)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 09:24:18 UTC  ```  Created poppler tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 995400](show_bug.cgi?id=995400 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2142 poppler: poppler, xpdf: Insufficient sanitization of escape sequences in the error messages [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c27)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 09:25:41 UTC  ```  Created xpdf tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 995401](show_bug.cgi?id=995401 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2142 poppler, xpdf: Insufficient sanitization of escape sequences in the error messages [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 995402](show_bug.cgi?id=995402 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2142 poppler, xpdf: Insufficient sanitization of escape sequences in the error messages [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c28)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 09:34:02 UTC  ``` Relevant poppler Git repository patch:   <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=71bad47ed6a36d825b0d08992c8db56845c71e40>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c29)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-11 12:26:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jan Lieskovsky from [comment #28](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c28)) > Relevant poppler Git repository patch: >   > <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/> > ?id=71bad47ed6a36d825b0d08992c8db56845c71e40  Poppler patch modified against xpdf-3.0.3: (from <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/11/1>):   <http://sourceforge.net/projects/miscellaneouspa/files/misc/xpdf-3.03-CVE-2012-2142.diff>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c30)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-03 22:27:13 UTC  ``` poppler-0.20.2-16.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

An update that solves one vulnerability and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
poppler was updated to fix a security problem. PDF files
could emit messages with terminal escape sequences which
could be used to inject shell code if the user ran a PDF
viewer from a terminal shell (CVE-2012-2142).
Also a bug was fixed to avoid division by zero when using
origpagesizes option (bnc#795582)
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 12.2:

Subject: [CVE assignment notification] CVE-2012-2142 poppler, xpdf:
 Insufficient sanitization of escape sequences in the error message {AKA
 request for feedback if CVE to be marked as disputed / rejected}

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors, Mitre CVE assign department,

  long time ago (in the February of 2012 yet) we have received
the following private report from Phillips Wolf:

* poppler, xpdf: Insufficient sanitization of escape sequences in the error messages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  An insufficient escape sequences sanitization flaw was found in the way xpdf, a PDF file viewer for the X window system, and poppler, a PDF rendering library, performed sanitization of certain characters to be displayed in the error messages, which arose during presentation of certain PDF files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify a window's title, or, possibly execute arbitrary commands or overwrite files, via a specially-crafted PDF file containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator if local, unsuspecting user opened such crafted PDF file in xpdf or in an application linked against poppler library (for example evince).

  References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-2142>

We tested, confirmed the deficiency and based on that assigned CVE-2012-2142
identifier to the problem. Marek Kasik (Red Hat poppler package maintainer)
has provided the following patch against (in that time) upstream poppler version:
  [P] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c25>

We also contacted poppler and xpdf upstreams with request to review that
patch and agree on embargo date. The reply was as inlined:

Albert Astals Cid (lines prefixed with '>' are my words):

To be honest, as we discussed, I understand this is a flaw of whoever is
receiving our output, I don't mind "sanitizing" our output for everyone's
benefit, but as it is poppler's duty to not crash on broken/invalid/malicious
PDF files, it is whoever is processing poppler's output to not crash or
malfunction on broken/invalid/malicious input.

Does that help in your classification?

Cheers,
  Albert

Wouldn't it make more sense to treat this as a security hole in the
terminal emulator (xterm or whatever)?

If a sequence of escape characters sent to stdout/stderr can cause a
security problem, then all an attacker would need to do would be to
place the escape sequence in, e.g., a README file in a source code
tarball.  Surely you wouldn't consider that to be a security hole in
cat?

The bugtraq post referenced in [2] says this:

"The responsibility should rest on the actual terminal emulator; any
features that allow file or command-line  access should be disabled by
default and more attention should be paid to new features that
implement any use of escape sequences."

- Derek
========================================================

While we don't agree with poppler's / xpdf's upstream opinion (apply
the patches, but not to call the issue as a security flaw), since for example not
that recent, similar problem in Apache's httpd web server's mod_rewrite
module problem:
  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1862>

has got a CVE identifier [and "security flaw treatment"], we don't
want to argue with them longer => so if the CVE identifier should be revoked
as disputed / invalid / rejected at the end, we will leave that decision
to vendors / Mitre team.

What matters is, the issue is there, and this post is intended as notification
for vendors who might want to apply Marek's patch [P] to protect their
instances.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify a window's title, or, possibly execute arbitrary commands or overwrite files, via a specially-crafted PDF file containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator if local, unsuspecting user opened such crafted PDF file in xpdf or in an application linked against poppler library (for example evince).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-02-13 10:33:07 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the poppler package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the poppler package, as shipped with Fedora release of 18 and 19.  --  This issue affects the versions of the xpdf package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 and Fedora EPEL 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the poppler package, as shipped with Fedora release of 18 and 19.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c22)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-26 15:53:45 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-2142](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2142) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c24)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-27 13:20:52 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Phillips Wolf for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c25)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 08:41:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 784759](attachment.cgi?id=784759&action=diff "Proposed poppler patch by Marek Kasik (against upstream poppler version)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=784759&action=edit "Proposed poppler patch by Marek Kasik (against upstream poppler version)") Proposed poppler patch by Marek Kasik (against upstream poppler version)   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c26)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 09:24:18 UTC  ```  Created poppler tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 995400](show_bug.cgi?id=995400 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2142 poppler: poppler, xpdf: Insufficient sanitization of escape sequences in the error messages [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c27)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 09:25:41 UTC  ```  Created xpdf tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 995401](show_bug.cgi?id=995401 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2142 poppler, xpdf: Insufficient sanitization of escape sequences in the error messages [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 995402](show_bug.cgi?id=995402 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2142 poppler, xpdf: Insufficient sanitization of escape sequences in the error messages [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c28)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-09 09:34:02 UTC  ``` Relevant poppler Git repository patch:   <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=71bad47ed6a36d825b0d08992c8db56845c71e40>   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c29)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-08-11 12:26:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jan Lieskovsky from [comment #28](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c28)) > Relevant poppler Git repository patch: >   > <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/> > ?id=71bad47ed6a36d825b0d08992c8db56845c71e40  Poppler patch modified against xpdf-3.0.3: (from <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/11/1>):   <http://sourceforge.net/projects/miscellaneouspa/files/misc/xpdf-3.03-CVE-2012-2142.diff>   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=789936#c30)  Fedora Update System    2013-09-03 22:27:13 UTC  ``` poppler-0.20.2-16.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.
