| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=815122#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-04-22 17:09:33 UTC  ``` A cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaws were found in the way DokuWiki, a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, performed sanitization of the 'target' parameter when preprocessing edit form data. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL, which once visited by a valid DokuWiki user would lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the context of logged in DokuWiki user.

The error message when a non-existant editor was tried to load wasn't
escaped correctly, allowing to introduce arbitrary JavaScript to the
output, leading to a XSS vulnerability.

Note: the reported second XCRF vulnerability is the same bug, the xploit
code simply uses JavaScript to extract a valid CSRF token from the site

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-04-21 09:45:35 UTC  ``` From secunia:  Description Khashayar Fereidani has discovered a vulnerability in DocuWiki, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.  Input passed via the "target" parameter to doku.php (when "do" is set to "edit") is not properly sanitised in inc/html.php before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  The vulnerability is confirmed in version 2012-01-25. Other versions may also be affected.   Solution Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly sanitised(unpatched). ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2012-09-08 15:38:32 UTC  ``` CVE-2012-2129 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2012-2129>):   Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in doku.php in DokuWiki 2012-01-25   Angua allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the   target parameter in an edit action.  CVE-2012-2128 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2012-2128>):   ** DISPUTED **  Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in doku.php   in DokuWiki 2012-01-25 Angua allows remote attackers to hijack the   authentication of administrators for requests that add arbitrary users.    NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, who states that it is   resultant from CVE-2012-2129: "the exploit code simply uses the XSS hole to   extract a valid CSRF token." ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Lance Albertson (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-12-24 18:05:14 UTC  ``` FWIW I just bumped dokuwiki to 20121013. Feel free to mark stable after tests have checked it out. Not sure if that version has the fix in it or not. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2013-01-09 00:54:42 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201301-07 at <http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-201301-07.xml> by GLSA coordinator Stefan Behte (craig). ``` |  |

Subject: CVE Request -- DokuWiki: XSS and CSRF due improper escaping of 'target'
 parameter in preprocessing edit form data

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaws were
found in the way DokuWiki, a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, performed
sanitization of the 'target' parameter when preprocessing edit form data. A
remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL, which once visited by a
valid DokuWiki user would lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the
context of logged in DokuWiki user.

[6] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=815122>
     (Red Hat bugzilla entry)

Discovered by : Khashayar Fereidani

Proof of Concept URL:
<http://sitename/doku.php?do=edit&id=S9F8W2A&target=><script>alert(123)</script>

Could you allocate a 2012 CVE id for this issue? (one is enough because
only 'target' parameter isn't properly escaped, leading to XSS or CSRF
{see [2] for further examples})

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
