How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2483-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Yves-Alexis Perez

Package        : strongswan
Vulnerability  : authentication bypass
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2388

An authentication bypass issue was discovered by the Codenomicon CROSS
project in strongSwan, an IPsec-based VPN solution. When using
RSA-based setups, a missing check in the gmp plugin could allow an
attacker presenting a forged signature to successfully authenticate
against a strongSwan responder.

The default configuration in Debian does not use the gmp plugin for
RSA operations but rather the OpenSSL plugin, so the packages as
shipped by Debian are not vulnerable.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Release and vulnerability announcements for strongSwan

* [Blog](/blog/)
* [2012](/blog/2012)
* [strongSwan 4.6.4 Released (CVE-2012-2388)](/blog/2012/05/31/strongswan-4.6.4-released-%28cve-2012-2388%29.html)

## strongSwan 4.6.4 Released (CVE-2012-2388)

May 31, 2012

strongSwan 4.6.4 fixes a security vulnerability which affects all versions since 4.2.0 if the gmp plugin is used for RSA signature verification.

[release](/blog/tags/release)[4.6.x](/blog/tags/4.6.x)[security fix](/blog/tags/security%2Bfix)

### RSA signature verification vulnerability

This release fixes a security vulnerability ([CVE-2012-2388](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2012-2388)) which exists in all versions since 4.2.0 and up to 4.6.3. If the *gmp* plugin is used for RSA signature verification (the default on many platforms) an empty or zeroed signature is handled as a legitimate one. Both IKEv1 and IKEv2 are affected.

A connection definition using RSA authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Given that, an attacker presenting a forged signature and/or certificate can authenticate as any legitimate user. Injecting code is not possible by such an attack.

To fix this please either [update to 4.6.4](/download.html) or apply the [appropriate patch](http://download.strongswan.org/patches/09_gmp_rsa_signature_patch/) yourself. As a workaround the *openssl* or *gcrypt* plugin may be used for RSA signature verification.

We were informed by [CERT-FI](http://www.cert.fi) about this vulnerability which was originally discovered by the [Codenomicon CROSS project](http://www.codenomicon.com/solutions/cross.shtml).

### Other fixes

* The behavior of the IKEv2 daemon charon during reauthentication and mobility has been improved in several corner cases. Especially in situations where MOBIKE is disabled or not supported by the other peer.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
