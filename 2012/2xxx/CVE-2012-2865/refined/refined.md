Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-2865:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds read in line breaking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, meaning the software attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer. This suggests a flaw in how the line-breaking logic handles boundary conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The severity is marked as "Medium," which indicates that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    -  Data exposure
    - Potential for further exploitation depending on the memory layout, but not necessarily code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted input that triggers the line-breaking logic and leads to an out-of-bounds read. This input is likely related to text rendering.
  - While specific details are not provided, this would most likely be a webpage with specific formatting, rendered through Chrome.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to provide or influence input to the affected line-breaking functionality.
- This could possibly be through a malicious web page, or other text based content.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug was found by miaubiz.
- A security reward of $500 was given.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Chrome version 21.0.1180.89 and openSUSE update to version 21.0.1180.88
