  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The Intuit Help System protocol in QuickBooks is vulnerable to a file disclosure vulnerability due to a lack of proper input validation when handling file paths. The application is also vulnerable to heap corruption and memory leaks due to insufficient validation of URLs passed to the protocol handler.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "File disclosure vulnerability",
        "Heap corruption vulnerability",
        "Memory leak vulnerability",
        "Lack of proper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker may be able to retrieve sensitive files or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content. Successful exploitation of the file disclosure vulnerability allows reading of files from ZIP archives, but is limited to files that are not within subdirectories. The heap corruption vulnerability can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious HTML and Javascript",
        "Exploiting the Intuit Help System protocol"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft malicious HTML or JavaScript. For file disclosure, the attacker must know or guess the path and file name of a target ZIP archive and the target file it contains. The attacker does not require any special privileges, but must have local or network access to the target ZIP archive."
