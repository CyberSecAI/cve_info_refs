Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   SQL injection vulnerability exists in Gajim due to the way it handles Jabber IDs (JIDs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper handling of user-supplied data within JIDs allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL statements into database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary SQL statements. This could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially compromising user information and the integrity of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Jabber ID to a user using Gajim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted JIDs to Gajim users, typically through the Jabber/XMPP network.

**Summary of Exploitation**

*   An attacker crafts a malicious Jabber ID containing SQL injection payloads.
*   The attacker sends the malicious JID to a user via the Jabber/XMPP network.
*   When Gajim processes the malicious JID, it is used in a SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Gajim version 0.15-r1 and later.
*   The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, giving a clear view of the exploitation methodology.
