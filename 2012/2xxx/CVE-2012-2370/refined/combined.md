| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=822468#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-05-17 12:58:02 UTC  ``` An integer overflow flaw was found in the way X BitMap (XBM) image file format loader of gdk-pixbuf, an image loading library used with GNOME, used to read bitmap file data for certain images. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XBM image file, which once loaded in an application linked against gdk-pixbuf, would lead to that application termination (GLib error and application abort).

| [Description](#c0)  David Grant    2004-01-06 09:00:11 UTC  ``` The twiki/templates directory should have permissions of 444, not 644. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-01-22 15:53:44 UTC  ``` could you reemerge it i've just moved it completely out of htdocs ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  David Grant    2004-01-23 10:18:46 UTC  ``` What will happen to all the data I have on my twiki site at /var/www/localhost/htdocs/twiki ??? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  David Grant    2004-01-23 10:22:30 UTC  ``` Two small things:  In the $Header: line, you are missing the last "$", so $Header: $  Why are there so many commented out lines? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  David Grant    2004-01-23 10:23:32 UTC  ``` Last thing, why isn't the old ebuild still in CVS?  Shouldn't all ebuild revisions be kept? ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  David Grant    2004-01-26 15:24:54 UTC  ``` Why is twiki now outside htdocs?  My Gallery is inside htdocs, so why shouldn't twiki be there too? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-01-27 15:21:51 UTC  ``` read install, it's just a security thingie ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  David Grant    2004-01-27 15:50:15 UTC  ``` I'm worried about screwing up my current twiki installation.  I assume it won't move all my data over for me? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Martin Holzer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-01-27 15:54:30 UTC  ``` no it doesn't  not really much to do, just move all to the new directory ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  David Grant    2004-01-28 07:29:29 UTC  ``` I'd still prefer that you had created a -r1 ebuild instead of just modifying the one that was there.  I'd like to see the changes that were made before emerging the new ebuild.  If you can I'd really like it if you can cvs/commit the current version as a -r1 ebuild, then checkout the old revision and re-commit that on top of the base (r0) revision.  Then future changes should go into -r2,-r3,etc. releases. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Stuart Herbert (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-23 03:22:57 UTC  ``` Hi David,  It's our policy not to do -r1, -r2 and so on for ebuilds that are marked unstable.  Ebuilds marked as unstable are in Portage for testing.  Closing old bug.  Best regards, Stu ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# gdk-pixbuf: Denial of service — GLSA **201206-20**

Multiple vulnerabilities in gdk-pixbuf may create a Denial of
Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-libs/gdk-pixbuf** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.24.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.24.1-r1** |

### Background

gdk-pixbuf is an image loading library for GTK+.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been found in gdk-pixbuf:

* The "gdk\_pixbuf\_\_gif\_image\_load()" function in io-gif.c fails to
  properly handle certain return values from subroutines (CVE-2011-2485).
* The "read\_bitmap\_file\_data()" function in io-xbm.c contains an
  integer overflow error (CVE-2012-2370).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image
in an application linked against gdk-pixbuf, possibly resulting in Denial
of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gdk-pixbuf users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/gdk-pixbuf-2.24.1-r1"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

### Bug Description

It's possible to crash any application with memory allocation error, or potentially corrupt heap because width/height parameters isn't properly verified.

TEST FILE:

#define width 1

#define height -1

static char bits[] = {

HOW TO REPRODUCE:

Open directory containing this file with nautilus. Nautilus should crash on file thumbnailing.

Try to attach this file using Firefox. Firefox gtk-file-chooser dialog breaks firefox when it trying to show picture preview.

Affected source: gdk-pixbuf/io-xbm.c

230 bytes\_per\_line = (ww+7)/8 + padding;

231

232 size = bytes\_per\_line \* hh; // Overflow

233 bits = g\_malloc (size);

Potential heap corruption:

326 ptr = data;

327 for (y = 0; y < h; y++) {

328 bits = 0;

329 for (x = 0; x < w; x++) {

Thanks for this report! Since the w and h variables are unsigned, this is actually "just" a denial of service crash, since the loop that copies out the data will run until it segfaults, so the results aren't controllable.

Additional check for values width and height.

Also look as this bug also specific to libXmu: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXmu/tree/src/RdBitF.c> but for Xorg exist check for allocation result and works without crash.

## Topic

Updated gtk2 packages that fix one security issue and several bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

GIMP Toolkit (GTK+) is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user
interfaces.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the X BitMap (XBM) image file loader
in GTK+. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XBM image file
that, when opened in an application linked against GTK+ (such as Nautilus),
would cause the application to crash. (CVE-2012-2370)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Due to a bug in the Input Method GTK+ module, the usage of the Taiwanese

Big5 (zh\_TW.Big-5) locale led to the unexpected termination of certain
applications, such as the GDM greeter. The bug has been fixed, and the
Taiwanese locale no longer causes applications to terminate unexpectedly.
(BZ#487630)

* When a file was initially selected after the GTK+ file chooser dialog was

opened and the Location field was visible, pressing the Enter key did not
open the file. With this update, the initially selected file is opened
regardless of the visibility of the Location field. (BZ#518483)

* When a file was initially selected after the GTK+ file chooser dialog was

opened and the Location field was visible, pressing the Enter key did not
change into the directory. With this update, the dialog changes into the
initially selected directory regardless of the visibility of the Location
field. (BZ#523657)

* Previously, the GTK Print dialog did not reflect the user-defined printer

preferences stored in the ~/.cups/lpoptions file, such as those set in the
Default Printer preferences panel. Consequently, the first device in the
printer list was always set as a default printer. With this update, the
underlying source code has been enhanced to parse the option file. As a
result, the default values in the print dialog are set to those previously
specified by the user. (BZ#603809)

* The GTK+ file chooser did not properly handle saving of nameless files.

Consequently, attempting to save a file without specifying a file name
caused GTK+ to become unresponsive. With this update, an explicit test for
this condition has been added into the underlying source code. As a result,
GTK+ no longer hangs in the described scenario. (BZ#702342)

* When using certain graphics tablets, the GTK+ library incorrectly

translated the input coordinates. Consequently, an offset occurred between
the position of the pen and the content drawn on the screen. This issue was
limited to the following configuration: a Wacom tablet with input
coordinates bound to a single monitor in a dual head configuration, drawing
with a pen with the pressure sensitivity option enabled. With this update,
the coordinate translation method has been changed, and the offset is no
longer present in the described configuration. (BZ#743658)

* Previously, performing drag and drop operations on tabs in applications

using the GtkNotebook widget could lead to releasing the same resource
twice. Eventually, this behavior caused the applications to terminate with
a segmentation fault. This bug has been fixed, and the applications using
GtkNotebook no longer terminate in the aforementioned scenario. (BZ#830901)

All users of GTK+ are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
