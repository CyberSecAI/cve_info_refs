  "CVE-2012-2092": {
    "description": "A Security Bypass vulnerability exists in Ubuntu Cobbler before 2,2,2 in the cobbler-ubuntu-import script due to an error when verifying the GPG signature.",
    "root_cause": "The `cobbler-ubuntu-import` script in the Ubuntu cobbler package downloads ISOs and checks them against MD5SUMS, but does not verify the validity of the MD5SUMS file itself against the MD5SUMS.gpg.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Security Bypass",
       "Insecure verification of checksum files"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially provide a malicious ISO file and corresponding MD5SUMS file, leading to the installation of a compromised system. By providing a crafted MD5SUMS file, an attacker could bypass the integrity check performed by the vulnerable script.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack on the mirror server",
      "Compromise of the mirror server"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to modify the contents of a mirror used by the `cobbler-ubuntu-import` script. This can be achieved by compromising the mirror server or by performing a man-in-the-middle attack."
