{
  "CVE-2012-2486": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability in the implementation of the Cisco Discovery Protocol component could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle malformed Cisco Discovery Protocol packets.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of malformed Cisco Discovery Protocol packets.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending malformed Cisco Discovery Protocol packets to an affected device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have a way to submit an Ethernet frame directly to an affected device. This is possible if the affected system is part of a bridged network or connected to a non-partitioned device (e.g., a network hub). The attacker must be adjacent to the affected device."
