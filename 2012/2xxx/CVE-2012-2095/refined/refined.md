Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2095:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2012-2095 and describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability in WICD due to insufficient sanitization of configuration properties. This aligns with the official CVE description: "The SetWiredProperty function in the D-Bus interface in WICD before 1.7.2 allows local users to write arbitrary configuration settings and gain privileges via a crafted property name in a dbus message."

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of input passed to the `SetWiredProperty` function via the D-Bus interface. This function allows users to set various properties of a wired network configuration. By crafting a malicious property name containing special characters, an attacker can bypass intended access controls and modify configurations in ways that can lead to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of sanitization of property names passed to `SetWiredProperty`. The code does not properly filter out potentially malicious characters or sequences, such as script-related keywords.
*   **D-Bus Interface Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how the D-Bus interface is used to set properties. There was no mechanism to prevent a malicious actor from injecting specially crafted strings that bypass normal restrictions, therefore exploiting how settings are processed.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By injecting script keywords, an attacker can execute scripts with root privileges which is typically blocked.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain root privileges on the system by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code by injecting shell commands using configuration property names. This includes the ability to run commands as root.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a full system compromise, with the attacker gaining complete control.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** Attackers require local access to the system.
*   **D-Bus Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending malicious D-Bus messages using the WICD D-Bus interface.
*   **Malicious Property Name:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious property names.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to communicate with the WICD daemon via D-Bus, which typically means the attacker must have local access to the machine.
*   No special privileges are needed beyond a regular user account.

**7. Additional Technical Details**

*   The fix involves implementing a `sanitize_config` function which filters property names to only allow alphanumeric characters and underscores.  This prevents the injection of malicious script keywords via dbus.
*   The fix also addresses an information leak by masking sensitive information in log files (referenced as CVE-2012-0813 in the provided texts), showing that this vulnerability was addressed alongside the primary security issue.

In summary, CVE-2012-2095 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability caused by inadequate input sanitization in the WICD D-Bus interface, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code as root. The fix involves sanitizing the configuration properties to remove unwanted or dangerous characters, preventing the exploitation.
