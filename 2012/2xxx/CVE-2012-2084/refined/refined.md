Subject: CVE's for Drupal Contrib 2012 001 through 057 (67 new CVE assignments)

So I went through all the Drupal contrib modules for 2012, 4 already
have CVE's, 3 are not security issues/not clear ("may also have an sql
injection" isn't quite enough). The data is below in CSV format and
attached as a file since the line wraps are mangling it up. Data is in
the form:

"CVE(or note)",SA#","description","URL"

=====================
...
"CVE-2012-2084","SA-CONTRIB-2012-057","Printer, email and PDF versions -
Cross Site Scripting (XSS)","<https://drupal.org/node/1515722>"
...
```

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-2084:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Printer, email and PDF versions" Drupal module contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is within the "Printer, email and PDF versions" module. It is likely that the module does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it on web pages.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into the module.
