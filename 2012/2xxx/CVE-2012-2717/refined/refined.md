Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2717:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Software:** Drupal "Mobile Tools" contributed module

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The module fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in the web browser, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious client-side scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary script execution:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web pages, which are then executed in the context of the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions as the victim user

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker would need to inject the malicious script through an input field or some other user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized by the "Mobile Tools" module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable module, often as a user who is able to make changes to a page that uses the module.

**Additional Information:**
* This vulnerability is specific to the "Mobile Tools" contributed module for Drupal.
* The information confirms the XSS vulnerability mentioned in the CVE description.
