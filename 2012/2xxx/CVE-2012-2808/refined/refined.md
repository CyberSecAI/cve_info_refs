Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2808:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of an insufficiently random algorithm in the DNS resolver of Firefox for Android. This flawed algorithm was inherited from an older version of the `Bionic` libc library. The pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in this older library produced predictable values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Weak PRNG:** The core issue lies in how the DNS resolver generates unique identifiers (nonces) for DNS requests. The TXID and UDP source port, which should be unpredictable, were derived from a formula involving `timesec`, `timeµfrac`, and `pid`.
- **Time Correlation:**  The time values used in the formula were highly correlated because they were generated in quick succession using the same function, making the resulting identifiers predictable.
    - The time difference (∆) between the generation of TXID and the port was not sufficiently random.
    - The XOR of the time values (χ) was also not sufficiently random.
- **Predictable Identifiers:** Due to the weak PRNG, attackers could predict the unique identifiers used in DNS requests, significantly increasing the likelihood of successful DNS poisoning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **DNS Poisoning:**  Successful exploitation would enable an attacker to inject malicious DNS responses, which would be accepted by the vulnerable resolver.
- **Spoofed Web Sites:** Attackers could redirect victims to spoofed websites.
- **Cookie Theft:**  By controlling the DNS resolution, attackers could steal cookies associated with the legitimate domain, potentially leading to session hijacking.
- **Further Attacks:** Gaining control over DNS resolution opens the door for various other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the victim and the DNS server could inject spoofed DNS responses.
- **Malicious JavaScript:** An attacker could lure the victim to a malicious webpage, which then triggers DNS requests for non-existing subdomains. Successful spoofing of these subdomains would allow the attacker to steal cookies.
- **Malicious Applications:** A malicious application on the victim's device could instantiate the browser application on a malicious website controlled by the attacker, thus enabling the same attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Position:**  The attacker must be able to intercept and inject network traffic to perform DNS poisoning.
- **Knowledge of Timing:** The attacker needed to understand the timing and correlation issues in the weak PRNG.
- **(Optional) Knowledge of PID:** Knowing the PID of the target process could significantly reduce the time required for a successful attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Firefox for Android due to the use of an outdated `Bionic` libc library.
- The vulnerability did not affect desktop versions of Mozilla products.
- The fix involves using `/dev/urandom` as a source of randomness, which provides higher entropy.
- The patched code includes an assertion to detect failures when reading from `/dev/urandom`, which would indicate an underlying issue.
- The `res_randomid` function is used to set the `rest_state::id` which is a `u_short`.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on July 24, 2012.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by updating the DNS resolver to use `/dev/urandom` for generating random identifiers, as well as adding an assertion to the code that reads from `/dev/urandom`. This fix was included in Firefox 37.
