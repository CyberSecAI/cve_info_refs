Message-ID: <1338319222.16666.294.camel@new-desktop>

From: Nicolas Grégoire <nicolas.gregoire@...rri.fr>

Subject: Re: CVE Request: XXE vulnerability in Restlet

> Please use CVE-2012-2656 for this issue.

Thanks !

> Also is there a specific source file/etc that contains the fix?

The changelog refers to this change:
<https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/commit/115c17c1f9aab4bd431ae44a36741b86be4c5f53>

However, this one (safer default values for options like
"secureProcessing" and "expandingEntityRefs") seems much more relevant:
<https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/commit/ec692bd3b5e386261413210191b179fec22b6cd2>

By the way, credits are wrong (I'm the original reporter) and should be
fixed soon.

Nicolas

  Description     : RESTful Web framework for Java

Restlet is a lightweight REST framework for Java.
.
Restlet has a light core but thanks to its pluggable extension, it is also a
comprehensive REST framework for Java. It supports all REST concepts (Resource,
Representation, Connector, Component, etc.) and is suitable for both client and
server Web applications.
.
It supports major Web standards like HTTP, SMTP, XML, JSON, WADL, and Atom.
Many extensions are also available to integrate with Servlet, Spring, Jetty,
JiBX and others.
.
A GWT version is also available and is a direct port of the main Java version.

... there shouldn t be a limit at

oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=999809#c0)  David Jorm    2013-08-22 07:39:40 UTC  ``` It was found that Restlet is vulnerable to XXE (XML eXternal Entity) attacks. If a Restlet endpoint using XML transport, a user can submit a request containing an external XML entity. This XML entity will be resolved, allowing a remote attacker to read files in the context of the user running the application server.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=999809#c1)  David Jorm    2013-08-22 07:41:14 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://blog.restlet.com/2012/05/23/restlet-framework-2-1-rc5-and-2-0-14-released/>  Statement:  Not Vulnerable. This issue does not affect the versions of Restlet as shipped with various Red Hat products.   ``` |  |
