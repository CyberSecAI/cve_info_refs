      "content": "Root cause: Rack::Cache was caching `Set-Cookie` response headers. This is problematic because it leads to session hijacking as the session id gets cached and shared with other users.\n\nWeaknesses: The vulnerability stems from the fact that Rack::Cache was caching responses marked as public even when they had `Set-Cookie` headers.\n\nImpact of exploitation: An attacker could potentially obtain other users' cookies to bypass authentication by accessing the cache.\n\nAttack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited when a public resource is cached with Set-Cookie headers included.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to have access to the cache or be able to trigger a cache entry to be created that includes a `Set-Cookie` header.  This would lead to session hijacking."
