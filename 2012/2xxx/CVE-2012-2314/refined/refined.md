Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-2314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Anaconda bootloader configuration module using incorrect file permissions (0755) when writing the password configuration file. The intended permission should have been 0700.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the use of overly permissive file permissions (0755 instead of 0700) for the password configuration file. This allows other local users to read the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Password Hash Exposure:** Local users could read the password hashes stored in the configuration file.
*   **Brute-force Attacks:**  The exposed password hashes could be used to conduct brute-force password guessing attacks.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful brute-force attacks could lead to:
    *   Password circumvention.
    *   Machine reboot.
    *   Use of custom kernel or initrd command line parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires a local user with access to the system's file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
*   The attacker needs to have read access to the affected file, which is made possible by the incorrect permissions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affected the Anaconda package as shipped with Fedora 16.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, as well as Fedora 15, were not affected.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was included in `grub2-1.99-13.fc16.3`.
