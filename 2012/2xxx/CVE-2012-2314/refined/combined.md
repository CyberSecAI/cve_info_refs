Subject: CVE Request -- anaconda: Weak permissions by writing password configuration
 file in bootloader configuration module

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way bootloader configuration module of
Anaconda, a graphical system installer, stored password hashes when performing
write of password configuration file (0755 permissions were used instead of
0700 ones). A local users could use this flaw to obtain password hashes and
conduct brute force password guessing attacks (possibly leading to password
circumvention, machine reboot or use of custom kernel or initrd command line
parameters).

Upstream patch:
[1] <http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=anaconda.git;a=commit;h=03ef13b625cc06873a924e0610340f8489fd92df>

References:
[2] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=819031>

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Subject: CVE-2023-4001: a password bypass vulnerability in the downstream GRUB
 boot manager

References:

<https://dfir.ru/2024/01/15/cve-2023-4001-a-vulnerability-in-the-downstream-grub-boot-manager/>
<https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-4001>

Plain-text details taken from the first reference:

One can set a password to protect the boot menu entries and the
command-line shell of the GRUB boot manager (see the official manual and
the Red Hat manual). This is an additional security measure to be used
along with a BIOS/UEFI password (e.g., to protect corporate computers
from unprivileged users trying to leverage their physical access to boot
another operating system or to escalate the privileges in an installed
operating system).

Under the hood, this feature is implemented as two GRUB commands:
“password” and “password_pbkdf2“. When one of these commands is issued
with a proper set of arguments, a user with a specified password (or its
hash) is created. And only those users listed in the “superusers”
environment variable (when it’s set by issuing the “set” command) are
allowed to edit boot menu entries and execute commands in the GRUB
shell. (A physically-present user is required to authenticate as a
superuser when trying to edit a menu entry or trying to enter the GRUB
shell.)

In most cases, commands to set the “superusers” variable and to create
corresponding users are stored in the GRUB configuration file,
“grub.cfg” (which is more like a script, not a pure configuration file).

There were some vulnerabilities affecting the GRUB password protection
feature, like weak permissions for the GRUB configuration file that
allowed unprivileged users to obtain plain-text passwords and/or
password hashes (for example: CVE-2012-2314, CVE-2013-4577, and
CVE-2021-3981), an integer underflow (CVE-2015-8370), and even an
improper string comparison (CVE-2009-4128).

Now, there is one more: CVE-2023-4001.

This vulnerability allows unprivileged users with physical access to a
computer to bypass the password protection feature of the GRUB boot
manager on many (but not all) UEFI-based computers. In some uncommon
setups, no unprivileged access is required (so, physical access without
an ability to log in into an operating system is enough).

In theory, commands required to properly enable the password protection
feature (i.e., to create a user and to set a list of superusers) of the
GRUB boot manager can be stored in two locations: in the configuration
file embedded in the GRUB image (which is an EFI executable) and in the
“external” configuration file (which is most likely named “grub.cfg“).

In the UEFI Secure Boot world, GRUB images are signed, so they can’t
contain anything other than a hard-coded (vendor-defined) password or
its hash (and, hopefully, there are none). So, the corresponding
commands have to be stored in the “external” configuration file, “grub.cfg“.

Originally, on BIOS-based systems, this configuration was stored as a
single file in the same directory with the GRUB files.

But on UEFI computers this configuration became split between two files:
the first one in the EFI System Partition volume
(“/boot/efi/EFI/<vendor>/grub.cfg“; it’s usually a FAT12/16/32 file
system) and the second one in the “/boot” volume (“/boot/grub/grub.cfg”
or “/boot/grub2/grub.cfg“; it’s usually a file system not supported by
the UEFI firmware: e.g., Ext2/4 or XFS). The latter will called “the
main configuration file” here.

A thorough explanation of this new scheme can be found here:
<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/UnifyGrubConfig>.

When the GRUB password is set (e.g., using the “grub2-set-password”
tool), it’s written to the main configuration file. And the first
configuration file is just a simple script to locate and execute the
main configuration file (as shown on the screenshot below).

<screenshot>

A configuration file found in the EFI System Partition (CentOS Stream 9)

If the password-related commands were stored in the first configuration
file, there would be no issue described in this post. But they are
stored in the main configuration file, which is found and then executed
by the first configuration file.

What if the main configuration file isn’t found? The GRUB boot manager
will spawn its shell.

Interestingly, we can force the main configuration file to “disappear”
(at least on some systems) when the first configuration file is
executed. So, there would be no password prompt (because no
password-related commands are ever executed after the power-on event)
and the GRUB shell will be immediately available to a physically-present
user.

The UUID is the key! The main configuration file is located using a
predefined path: “<device>/grub2/grub.cfg” (as shown on the screenshot
above). Here, “<device>” is a volume found by its file system UUID using
the “search” command.

And duplicate file system UUIDs pose a security problem…

If there are two file systems sharing the same UUID, one of them is the
real “/boot” volume and another one is an empty volume, the GRUB boot
manager could, under some circumstances, pick a wrong device as
containing the main configuration file. And if there is no main
configuration file stored (that empty volume case), the GRUB shell is
spawned.

Internally, the “search” command tries every partition on every block
device until a specified signature (a file system UUID in this case, but
the command also supports searching by a volume label and by a file) is
found.

All block devices are tried in the same order as returned when
enumerating their EFI handles (“hd0”, “hd1”, “hd2” and so on, “hd0”
corresponds to the first EFI handle returned when enumerating EFI block
devices). Some UEFI implementations enumerate non-removable drives
before removable ones, while others do exactly the opposite (e.g., my
Lenovo laptop exposed this behavior; the UEFI implementation of
VirtualBox with USB3 support enabled enumerates USB sticks before
internal drives too).

So, if an attached removable drive (like a USB stick) becomes “hd0” in
the GRUB boot manager (and the computer’s internal drive is “hd1” in
that case), it’s possible to bypass the GRUB password protection feature
by placing an empty file system with the same UUID as the real “/boot”
volume onto that removable drive and attaching it to the computer before
the boot. During the boot, the GRUB boot manager will simply spawn its
shell, without even asking for a password (and without changing the boot
order, of course).

Unprivileged users can learn the UUID value of the “/boot” volume using
the “lsblk” tool (because file system UUIDs are exposed to unprivileged
users).

Here is a video demonstrating the attack:
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mMlEIgfnUKIgaOEBNmtWuRo7RUAqjDrT/view?usp=sharing>.

It should be noted that some Linux distributions provide enough debug
output in a separate console, so a necessary UUID can be obtained from
there (and no unprivileged access to the operating system is required in
this case).

Timeline

  2023-04-03: the vulnerability was discovered by me.
  2023-07-17: the vulnerability was reported by me to Red Hat.
  2023-10-17: an initial fix is available for testing.
  2023-10-18: an issue was discovered by me in that fix (an attacker
could bypass an additional check implemented by the patch by attaching
10 removable drives to the computer, if that number of removable drives
is supported by the firmware).
  2023-10-30: a new fix is available for testing.
  2023-10-31: two issues were discovered in that fix (one issue is a
“huge” heap overflow introduced when working with strings in the patched
code, another issue is a minor out-of-bounds write of a null byte).
  2023-10-31: a final fix is available.
  2023-11-23: the disclosure date is agreed upon — 2024-01-15.
  2024-01-12: the vulnerability is disclosed by Red Hat.
  2024-01-15: this post has arrived.

Fix

A fix proposed by Red Hat implements a new argument to the “search”
command, which restricts the UUID scan to the block device used to
launch the GRUB boot manager. This means that the “/boot” volume must
reside on the same drive as the EFI System Partition.

An alternative (but not implemented) approach would be to use something
that isn’t exposed to unprivileged users as a signature to locate the
“/boot” volume. This could be a file with a random name residing in a
directory with restricted permissions.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.
