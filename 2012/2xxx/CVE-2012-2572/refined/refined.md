Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2572:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the ThreeWP Email Reflector WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin fails to sanitize the "Subject" field of emails before processing and displaying it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is persistent XSS. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the email subject is stored and then executed within the context of the victim's browser when they view the email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser who views the email.
- **Session Hijacking:** This could lead to session hijacking, where an attacker steals a user's login session, gaining unauthorized access to their account.
- **Malicious Actions:** The injected JavaScript can be used to perform various malicious activities including redirecting the user to attacker controlled websites, stealing cookies, displaying phishing pages or other malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Injection:** An attacker crafts a malicious email with a crafted XSS payload in the "Subject" field.
- **Plugin processing:** The ThreeWP Email Reflector plugin processes the email including the malicious subject and stores it. When a user views the email, the malicious javascript in the subject is rendered and executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send emails:** The attacker needs the ability to send emails to an email address that is processed by the vulnerable plugin.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin:** The attacker must know that the target is using the vulnerable WordPress plugin, ThreeWP Email Reflector.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit-db content provides a list of various payloads that can be used to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- The exploit-db also includes a basic python script that can send emails with a malicious subject.
- The wordpress.org entry confirms the plugin has been closed due to a guideline violation.
