  "CVE-2012-2149": {
    "description": "A memory overwrite flaw was found in the way a customized, internal copy of libwpd (a library for handling WordPerfect documents), as used by OpenOffice.org application suite processed certain WordPerfect (WPD) documents. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted WPD file, which once opened in an application from the OpenOffice.org suite, would lead to that application crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in how libwpd processes certain WordPerfect (.wpd) files.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory overwrite",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Opening a specially crafted WPD file can lead to application crashes or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
     "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can provide a malicious WPD file to a user.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted WPD file to a user of vulnerable software. No authentication is needed.",
