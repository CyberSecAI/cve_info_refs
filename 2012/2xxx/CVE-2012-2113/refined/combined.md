How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     : 678140

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Tiff, a library set and tools
to support the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), allowing denial of service and
potential privilege escalation.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited via a specially crafted TIFF image.

CVE-2012-2113
  The tiff2pdf utility has an integer overflow error when parsing images.

CVE-2012-3401
  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala discovered heap-based buffer overflow in the
  t2p_read_tiff_init() function.

CVE-2010-2482
  An invalid td_stripbytecount field is not properly handle and can trigger a
  NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2010-2595
  An array index error, related to "downsampled OJPEG input." in the
  TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function causes an unexpected crash.

CVE-2010-2597
  Also related to "downsampled OJPEG input", the TIFFVStripSize function crash
  unexpectly.

CVE-2010-2630
  The TIFFReadDirectory function does not properly validate the data types of
  codec-specific tags that have an out-of-order position in a TIFF file.

CVE-2010-4665
  The tiffdump utility has an integer overflow in the ReadDirectory function.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

Sidhpurwala    2012-04-09 05:59:17 UTC  ``` Here is some analysis of this issue:  When the tiff file is read in tif_dirread.c in function TIFFReadDirectory() the following code snippet is used:          if (isTiled(tif)) {                 tif->tif_tilesize = TIFFTileSize(tif);  TIFFTileSize() calls TIFFVTileSize(), here the following multiplications occurs:   tilesize = multiply(tif, nrows, TIFFTileRowSize(tif),                                     "TIFFVTileSize"); In the case of this repro, this makes tilesize as 2147483648, and then later          return ((tsize_t)             multiply(tif, tilesize, td->td_tiledepth, "TIFFVTileSize"));  Here td->td_tiledepth = -1, this makes tilesize as -2147483648, which is assigned to tif->tif_tilesize  Later when the tile is read via TIFFReadEncodedTile(), it calls DumpModeDecode() with cc = -2147483648, which inturn calls _TIFFmemcpy() which is a wrapper around mempcy and the size of in this case is -2147483648. This results in a buffer overflow and libtiff crashes.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c5)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-09 06:08:55 UTC  ``` So to summarise the above, this is essentially a type-conversion issue, leading to a heap-buffer overflow.  multiply() return a uint32, but tilesize is tsize_t which is int32, in our case this results in a positive integer being cast as negative.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-09 06:47:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 576121](attachment.cgi?id=576121&action=diff "I am not totally familiar with libtiff code, but this patch seems to work and does not produce any visible regressions") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=576121&action=edit "I am not totally familiar with libtiff code, but this patch seems to work and does not produce any visible regressions") I am not totally familiar with libtiff code, but this patch seems to work and does not produce any visible regressions   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c7)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-09 06:53:35 UTC  ``` Tom,  Hi, can you verify the above analysis and patches, also we need to send this upstream. Thanks.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c8)  Tom Lane    2012-04-11 16:18:41 UTC  ``` I talked to upstream and they don't seem to have any better ideas than what I mentioned in [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=803078#c6](show_bug.cgi?id=803078#c6 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1173 libtiff: Heap-buffer overflow due to TileSize calculation when parsing tiff files"), viz adding checks in TIFFVTileSize and TIFFVStripSize for negative result.  So I'll push forward on that.  t2p_read_tiff_size needs work too.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c10)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-17 04:30:46 UTC  ``` Tom,  ping, any news from upstream about this?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c11)  Tom Lane    2012-04-17 20:50:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 578148](attachment.cgi?id=578148&action=diff "patch for uint32 vs tsize_t problems in libtiff 3.9") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=578148&action=edit "patch for uint32 vs tsize_t problems in libtiff 3.9") patch for uint32 vs tsize_t problems in libtiff 3.9   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c12)  Tom Lane    2012-04-17 20:52:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 578149](attachment.cgi?id=578149&action=diff "patch for lack of overflow checking in tiff2pdf (3.9)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=578149&action=edit "patch for lack of overflow checking in tiff2pdf (3.9)") patch for lack of overflow checking in tiff2pdf (3.9)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c13)  Tom Lane    2012-04-17 20:59:29 UTC  ``` I have written and tested patches for the two issues we are dealing with here.  I think that we should actually treat them as two separate issues (two CVEs), because a look into the source code shows that the tsize_t problem is already fixed by upstream in libtiff 4.0.x.  So the first one only applies to 3.x releases, while the second is still applicable to 4.0.  I also notice that upstream's handling of the first matter in 4.0 is such that they will reject negative signed values for strip/tile sizes, which means that they have already accepted the limitation of buffer sizes not larger than 2GB on 32-bit machines.  So that makes me less concerned about back-patching a similar limitation into 3.x.  I need to adjust the tiff2pdf patch for the 4.0 code base and then send all three patches upstream; I will ask them about embargo dates when I do that (probably tomorrow).  We will also have a bit of work to do to back-port these patches into older 3.x releases, so there's a bit of work to do yet before we're ready anyhow.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c14)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-18 05:19:18 UTC  ``` Splitting the CVEs here:  CVE-2012-2088: This is for the type conversion flaw, which affects 3.x, but is fixed in upstream 4.0  CVE-2012-2113: This one is for integer overflow in tiff2pdf, which affects all versions.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c22)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-06-18 04:28:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c14)) > Splitting the CVEs here: >  > CVE-2012-2088: This is for the type conversion flaw, which affects 3.x, but > is fixed in upstream 4.0 >  > CVE-2012-2113: This one is for integer overflow in tiff2pdf, which affects > all versions.  Based on the above, it makes more sense to split the bugs as well, since these issues are essentially different.  This bug is going to be used for [CVE-2012-2113](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2113)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c24)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2012-04-09 05:59:17 UTC  ``` Here is some analysis of this issue:  When the tiff file is read in tif_dirread.c in function TIFFReadDirectory() the following code snippet is used:          if (isTiled(tif)) {                 tif->tif_tilesize = TIFFTileSize(tif);  TIFFTileSize() calls TIFFVTileSize(), here the following multiplications occurs:   tilesize = multiply(tif, nrows, TIFFTileRowSize(tif),                                     "TIFFVTileSize"); In the case of this repro, this makes tilesize as 2147483648, and then later          return ((tsize_t)             multiply(tif, tilesize, td->td_tiledepth, "TIFFVTileSize"));  Here td->td_tiledepth = -1, this makes tilesize as -2147483648, which is assigned to tif->tif_tilesize  Later when the tile is read via TIFFReadEncodedTile(), it calls DumpModeDecode() with cc = -2147483648, which inturn calls _TIFFmemcpy() which is a wrapper around mempcy and the size of in this case is -2147483648. This results in a buffer overflow and libtiff crashes.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c5)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-09 06:08:55 UTC  ``` So to summarise the above, this is essentially a type-conversion issue, leading to a heap-buffer overflow.  multiply() return a uint32, but tilesize is tsize_t which is int32, in our case this results in a positive integer being cast as negative.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-09 06:47:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 576121](attachment.cgi?id=576121&action=diff "I am not totally familiar with libtiff code, but this patch seems to work and does not produce any visible regressions") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=576121&action=edit "I am not totally familiar with libtiff code, but this patch seems to work and does not produce any visible regressions") I am not totally familiar with libtiff code, but this patch seems to work and does not produce any visible regressions   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c7)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-09 06:53:35 UTC  ``` Tom,  Hi, can you verify the above analysis and patches, also we need to send this upstream. Thanks.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c8)  Tom Lane    2012-04-11 16:18:41 UTC  ``` I talked to upstream and they don't seem to have any better ideas than what I mentioned in [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=803078#c6](show_bug.cgi?id=803078#c6 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1173 libtiff: Heap-buffer overflow due to TileSize calculation when parsing tiff files"), viz adding checks in TIFFVTileSize and TIFFVStripSize for negative result.  So I'll push forward on that.  t2p_read_tiff_size needs work too.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c10)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-17 04:30:46 UTC  ``` Tom,  ping, any news from upstream about this?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c11)  Tom Lane    2012-04-17 20:50:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 578148](attachment.cgi?id=578148&action=diff "patch for uint32 vs tsize_t problems in libtiff 3.9") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=578148&action=edit "patch for uint32 vs tsize_t problems in libtiff 3.9") patch for uint32 vs tsize_t problems in libtiff 3.9   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c12)  Tom Lane    2012-04-17 20:52:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 578149](attachment.cgi?id=578149&action=diff "patch for lack of overflow checking in tiff2pdf (3.9)") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=578149&action=edit "patch for lack of overflow checking in tiff2pdf (3.9)") patch for lack of overflow checking in tiff2pdf (3.9)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c13)  Tom Lane    2012-04-17 20:59:29 UTC  ``` I have written and tested patches for the two issues we are dealing with here.  I think that we should actually treat them as two separate issues (two CVEs), because a look into the source code shows that the tsize_t problem is already fixed by upstream in libtiff 4.0.x.  So the first one only applies to 3.x releases, while the second is still applicable to 4.0.  I also notice that upstream's handling of the first matter in 4.0 is such that they will reject negative signed values for strip/tile sizes, which means that they have already accepted the limitation of buffer sizes not larger than 2GB on 32-bit machines.  So that makes me less concerned about back-patching a similar limitation into 3.x.  I need to adjust the tiff2pdf patch for the 4.0 code base and then send all three patches upstream; I will ask them about embargo dates when I do that (probably tomorrow).  We will also have a bit of work to do to back-port these patches into older 3.x releases, so there's a bit of work to do yet before we're ready anyhow.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c14)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-04-18 05:19:18 UTC  ``` Splitting the CVEs here:  CVE-2012-2088: This is for the type conversion flaw, which affects 3.x, but is fixed in upstream 4.0  CVE-2012-2113: This one is for integer overflow in tiff2pdf, which affects all versions.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c22)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-06-18 04:28:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c14)) > Splitting the CVEs here: >  > CVE-2012-2088: This is for the type conversion flaw, which affects 3.x, but > is fixed in upstream 4.0 >  > CVE-2012-2113: This one is for integer overflow in tiff2pdf, which affects > all versions.  Based on the above, it makes more sense to split the bugs as well, since these issues are essentially different.  This bug is going to be used for [CVE-2012-2113](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2113)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=810551#c24)  Huzaifa S.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=832864#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-06-18 04:41:07 UTC  ``` A type-conversion flaw leading to a heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libtiff reads certain tiled tiff files. An attacker could create a specially-crafted TIFF image that, when opened, could cause an application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  This issue does affects only version 3.x, but is fixed in upstream 4.x  This bug has been split from: [bug 810551](show_bug.cgi?id=810551 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2113 libtiff: integer overflow in tiff2pdf leading to heap-buffer overflow when reading a tiled tiff file")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=832864#c1)  Huzaifa S.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1054)

## Topic

Updated libtiff packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
Image File Format (TIFF) files.

libtiff did not properly convert between signed and unsigned integer
values, leading to a buffer overflow. An attacker could use this flaw to
create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an
application linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2012-2088)

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
were found in the tiff2pdf tool. An attacker could use these flaws to
create a specially-crafted TIFF file that would cause tiff2pdf to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-2113)

All libtiff users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues. All running applications linked
against libtiff must be restarted for this update to take effect.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
