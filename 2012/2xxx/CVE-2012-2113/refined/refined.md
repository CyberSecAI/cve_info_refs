Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-2113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The primary issue is an integer overflow vulnerability within the `tiff2pdf` utility when parsing TIFF images. This overflow occurs during the calculation of buffer sizes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** The integer overflow leads to an incorrect calculation of buffer sizes during memory allocation. When a large size is calculated, it can wrap around to a small or negative value. Subsequently, this results in a heap-based buffer overflow when the application tries to copy data using the calculated size with  `_TIFFmemcpy()`, a wrapper around memcpy.
*   **Type Conversion Issue:** There's a type conversion issue.  The `multiply()` function returns a `uint32`, but the `tilesize` variable is of type `tsize_t` which is `int32`. This causes a positive integer from `multiply()` to be cast as a negative number when assigned to the signed `tsize_t`.
*   **Lack of Overflow Checking**: The code lacks proper checks for potential negative values or integer overflows during calculations within functions like `TIFFVTileSize` and `TIFFVStripSize`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack can lead to a crash of the `tiff2pdf` utility due to the buffer overflow.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):**  While primarily causing a crash, there's a potential for an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application due to the overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF Image:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted TIFF image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious TIFF file that will be processed by `tiff2pdf`. This can be achieved through various means, such as uploading a file, opening a file from a network share or having an application process it automatically.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `tif_dirread.c` during the TIFF directory read operation.
*   The problematic calculations occur in functions like `TIFFVTileSize`, which calls `multiply` to calculate the size of tiles.
*   The vulnerability is present in libtiff versions prior to the fix and the `tiff2pdf` tool.
*  The negative size value (-2147483648) is assigned to the `tif->tif_tilesize` which later results in a buffer overflow.

In summary, CVE-2012-2113 is an integer overflow in the `tiff2pdf` utility triggered by specially crafted TIFF images, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow that can cause denial of service and possibly arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability stems from unchecked calculations when parsing TIFF files.
