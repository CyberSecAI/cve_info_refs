**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization when adding calendar events. Specifically, the system did not properly filter user-provided information before storing it in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a stored SQL injection vulnerability. Malicious code or SQL queries could be injected via the calendar event input fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Serious Impact:** The vulnerability is classified as having a "Serious" risk. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to manipulate the database which could lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
