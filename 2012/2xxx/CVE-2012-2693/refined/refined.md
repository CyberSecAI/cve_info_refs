{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2012-2693",
    "description": "libvirt ignores address bus= device= when identical vendor ID/product IDs usb devices attached are ignored. As a consequence, the wrong USB device can be assigned to the wrong guest.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6"
    ],
    "root_cause": "libvirt was not properly differentiating USB devices with identical vendor and product IDs when attaching them to virtual machines.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect USB device assignment"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest could gain access to a host USB device that was intended for another guest, leading to potential data compromise or privilege escalation on the host system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Attaching USB devices to a virtual machine with libvirt"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control which USB device is assigned to a guest VM via libvirt, which could be done by modifying the VM configuration or by interacting with libvirt through virsh or virt-manager."
