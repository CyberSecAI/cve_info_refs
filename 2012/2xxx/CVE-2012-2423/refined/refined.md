{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The Intuit Help System protocol handler in QuickBooks processes file paths in a way that allows for file retrieval from zip archives and potentially leads to heap corruption.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "File disclosure vulnerability due to insecure handling of file paths within ZIP archives",
        "Heap corruption and memory leak vulnerability due to insecure URL handling"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can retrieve sensitive files from the local or network file system accessible to the user and potentially execute arbitrary code. This could lead to information disclosure, unauthorized access, and system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerabilities can be exploited by embedding malicious HTML and/or JavaScript content, which when viewed by a QuickBooks user, triggers the vulnerable protocol handler.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft malicious HTML/JavaScript content. They must know or guess the path and filename of the target ZIP archive and the file within it. The user must have local or network file system access to the targeted ZIP archive. For remote code execution, user interaction (viewing the malicious content) is required."
