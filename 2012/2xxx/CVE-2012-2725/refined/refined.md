**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the "Authoring HTML" Drupal contributed module. This likely means the module is not properly sanitizing or encoding user-supplied HTML content before rendering it in a web page.

**Weaknesses:**
-   Improper input sanitization/encoding of HTML content within the "Authoring HTML" module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the webpage that could execute in the browsers of other users visiting the site.
-   Successful exploitation could lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, phishing attacks, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The attacker would need to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into a field or area managed by the vulnerable "Authoring HTML" module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to have the ability to input HTML content that will be processed by the module. This might require authenticated access depending on where the vulnerable input field is located.
-   The attacker does not need to have high privileges, and can be any user able to add HTML content.
