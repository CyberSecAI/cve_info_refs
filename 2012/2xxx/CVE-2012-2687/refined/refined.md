  "CVE-2012-2687": {
    "description": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been confirmed if the Interstage HTTP Server mod_negotiation module is used in status code 406 error page generation processing.",
    "root_cause": "The Interstage HTTP Server's mod_negotiation module is vulnerable to XSS in the status code 406 error page generation processing due to improper handling of filenames, specifically in the make_variant_list function in mod_negotiation.c.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, a malicious user can execute arbitrary code on the computer of a victim who accesses a crafted page. The injected script could be executed as code of a trusted site, if the victim has set the targeted site as a trusted site, allowing actions such as reading user input, reading/overwriting cookies, or forwarding information to a third party.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific filename that is then used in 406 error page generation processing."
