  "CVE-2012-2736": {
    "description": "In NetworkManager 0.9.2.0, when a new wireless network was created with WPA/WPA2 security in AdHoc mode, it created an open/insecure network.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the interaction between NetworkManager and the kernel when creating Ad-Hoc networks with WPA/WPA2 security. The kernel was not properly handling the security settings, leading to the creation of an open, unencrypted network despite WPA/WPA2 being selected.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default settings for Ad-Hoc networks with WPA/WPA2 security",
       "Incorrect handling of WPA/WPA2 security in Ad-Hoc mode by kernel",
       "NetworkManager failed to properly enforce WPA/WPA2 security when creating Ad-Hoc networks."
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability results in the creation of an open/insecure wireless network when a user attempts to create a WPA/WPA2 secured Ad-Hoc network. This means that any data transmitted over this network is unencrypted and vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A user creates a new wireless network with WPA/WPA2 security in Ad-Hoc mode."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "User must be able to configure wireless network settings and create an Ad-Hoc network through NetworkManager.",
      "No specific attacker capabilities beyond connecting to the open network are required to exploit the vulnerability."
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability was addressed by disabling WPA adhoc networks completely in NetworkManager until a better solution could be found. The issue was present in NetworkManager 0.9.2.0 and possibly other versions and was related to a kernel bug."
