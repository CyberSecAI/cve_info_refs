# USN-1483-2: network-manager-applet vulnerability

27 June 2012

network-manager-applet could create insecure AdHoc wireless networks.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [network-manager-applet](/security/cves?package=network-manager-applet) - GNOME frontend for NetworkManager

## Details

USN-1483-1 fixed a vulnerability in NetworkManager by disabling the

creation of WPA-secured AdHoc wireless connections. This update provides

the corresponding change for network-manager-applet.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that certain wireless drivers incorrectly handled the

creation of WPA-secured AdHoc connections. This could result in AdHoc

wireless connections being created without any security at all. This update

removes WPA as a security choice for AdHoc connections in NetworkManager.

Subject: Creating a new wireless network with WPA results in an unsecured network
instead
Date: Mon, 16 Jan 2012 00:49:32 +1100
```
Package: network-manager-gnome
Version: 0.9.2.0-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security

I followed the following steps:

- Connect to a wired network.
- Click the network-manager-gnome icon, and select "Create New Wireless
  Network..."
- Type a network name.
- Select "WPA & WPA2 Personal".
- Click "Show password".
- Paste in a secure password (from pwgen -s 12).
- Click "Create".
- Observe that NetworkManager's icon for the network includes the lock
  icon indicating a secure network.
- Attempt to connect to the network from my N900.
- Observe that network icon shows lack of security.
- Observe that I can connect to the network and access the Internet
  through the network without providing the previously-specified
  password.

Note that creating a network using WEP results in a WEP-"secured"
network, rather than an unsecured network.  This issue only seems to
happen when attempting to create a WPA network.

Investigating further, I discovered that if I use the
nm-connection-editor to manually create a shared network with WPA and
Infrastructure mode, it doesn't show up as an available network in the
"Create New Wireless Network..." dialog.  If I change it to Ad-Hoc mode,
it shows up.  Some searching suggests that problems exist with WPA
networks in Ad-Hoc mode, which might explain why NM couldn't manage it.
However, it should have failed closed by refusing to create a network,
rather than failing open by creating an insecure network.

Please attach the output of iwlist scan (from the local computer and the
one you are trying to establish the connection), the output of nm-tool
and a debug log from NetworkManager [1]

Given that this particular feature (to create a WPA secured accesspoint)
is not that often used and that an open wireless AP does not imply that
the users data is accessible, I'm downgrading the severity to important
as imho this reflects more appropriately the severity of this bug.

Given that WEP provides almost no security at all, you're suggesting
that wanting a secure wireless network does not represent the common
case?

An open wireless AP where the user expected a secured one (and where the
UI claims they have one) can lead to revealed user data in several
different ways.

Might I suggest instead marking it as grave due to the security
implications but marking it as present in both testing and unstable so
it doesn't affect propagation to testing?

No, what I meant is that the majority of users never use NM to create an
Ad-Hoc wireless network. The common usage of NM is to connect to
infrastructure wireless networks.

As the current version in unstable is also in testing, testing
propagation is not affected by this bug anyway.

This seems like a fairly complete explanation of the problem:
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/commit/?id=69247a00eacd00617acbf1dfcee8497437b8ad39>

So, as soon as all the pieces of NM 0.9.4 make it into Debian, this bug
can get closed, in favor of a bug saying that NM can't create WPA
networks. :)

0.9.4 is now in Wheezy. Can you confirm that it fixes the bug?

Looks like it: I can confirm that NM no longer allows creating an Ad-Hoc
network that uses WPA.

Closing, then. (And updating the Debian security tracker)

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

I'm fine with either fixing it via a security or a regular stable
upload. Seems ubuntu did a security upload [1]

There is a patch at [2]. If you want to prepare a stable upload, then
I'm fine with that. Otherwise I'll have a look as soon as I find some time.

It would be great if you could prepare an upload when you are ready.
I'm dreadfully short of time at the moment, though I will find some if
you need assistance.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=782627#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-18 00:07:07 UTC  ``` A Debian bug report [1] indicated that certain versions of NetworkManager, when creating a wireless network (like a hotspot) with WPA/WPA2 security would result in an insecure network being created instead.  The following steps are outlined to reproduce (reported against network-manager-gnome 0.9.2.0-1 in Debian):  - Connect to a wired network. - Click the network-manager-gnome icon, and select "Create New Wireless   Network..." - Type a network name. - Select "WPA & WPA2 Personal". - Click "Show password". - Paste in a secure password (from pwgen -s 12). - Click "Create". - Observe that NetworkManager's icon for the network includes the lock   icon indicating a secure network. - Attempt to connect to the network from my N900. - Observe that network icon shows lack of security. - Observe that I can connect to the network and access the Internet   through the network without providing the previously-specified   password.  He also notes that creating a network using WEP results in a secured (via WEP) network instead of an open/unsecured network which is what is reported to happen when attempting to create a WPA-based network.  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=655972>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=782627#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-18 00:23:30 UTC  ``` It looks like this is corrected in newer versions of NetworkManager due to the hotspot functionality (at least I am unable to reproduce this in Fedora 16).  When I create a new hotsport with WPA security, it starts but I'm unable to connect to it (my OS X laptop sees it as a device to connect to but asks for a WEP password, not WPA, and although it says it connects, I don't get an IP address in OS X).  If I change this to WEP in F16, then OS X sees it as an insecure network (no padlock).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=782627#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-06-15 04:57:24 UTC  ``` This has been assigned [CVE-2012-2736](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-2736) as per:   <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/06/15/2>  Patch:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/commit/?id=69247a00eacd00617acbf1dfcee8497437b8ad39>  Note: This seems to be a kernel bug, and the current solution is to disable adhoc/WPA networks in NetworkManager, untill the kernel bug is fixed.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=782627#c6)  Vincent Danen    2015-08-22 15:56:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [network-manager](/security/cves?package=network-manager) - Network connection manager

## Details

It was discovered that certain wireless drivers incorrectly handled the

creation of WPA-secured AdHoc connections. This could result in AdHoc

wireless connections being created without any security at all. This update

removes WPA as a security choice for AdHoc connections in NetworkManager.

... there shouldn t be a limit at

oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

### [jdstrand](https://launchpad.net/~jdstrand)

This only affects Ad-Hoc networks that the user creates, not
networks the user connects to
Per upstream, this is actually a problem with the kernel as of
2.6.30
