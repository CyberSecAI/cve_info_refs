Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-2209:

**1. Verification:**
   - The exploit-db.com entry explicitly mentions CVE-2012-2209. The advisory ID HTB23085 references both CVE-2012-2208 and CVE-2012-2209.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Piwigo application. Specifically, the `section`, `installstatus`, and `theme` GET parameters in `admin.php` are vulnerable.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the administrator's browser session. This is a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can lead to:
        - Arbitrary code execution in the administrator's browser.
        - Session hijacking (stealing cookies).
        - Defacement of the admin page.
        - Other malicious actions that the attacker may inject via JavaScript.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through manipulated GET parameters in the URL of the Piwigo application's `admin.php` page.
    - Specifically, the `section`, `installstatus`, and `theme` parameters are vulnerable.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript code embedded within the vulnerable parameters.
   - The attacker must trick or entice an administrator of the vulnerable Piwigo instance to click on the crafted URL to trigger the XSS payload.
   - The attacker doesn't need any special access or privileges before exploiting this vulnerability, other than knowing the vulnerable Piwigo instance URL.
