The provided content is a security advisory for Moodle, and it includes a description of CVE-2012-2357.

**CVE-2012-2357**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a page in the CAS (Central Authentication Service) authentication process using an insecure HTTP URL instead of HTTPS.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure use of HTTP for a login page within the CAS authentication process, which is meant to be secure.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Apart from being insecure, the use of HTTP sent the user in circles within the authentication process. This likely resulted in an authentication loop or failure, and could expose authentication information.
*  **Attack vectors**: The attacker could potentially intercept the HTTP request made during the CAS authentication process since the data is transmitted over an insecure channel.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the Moodle server during the CAS authentication process. This position could be on the same local network, or any location where they can perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
