How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request -- Symfony / php-symfony-symfony: Session fixation flaw
 corrected in upstream 1.4.18 version

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a session fixation flaw was found in the way Symfony, an open-source PHP web applications
development framework, performed removal of user credential, adding several user credentials at once
and 'user authenticated' settings change by regenerating session ID. A remote attacker could provide
a specially-crafted URL, that when visited by a valid Symfony application user (victim) could lead
to unauthorized access to the victim's user account.

Upstream patch:
[4] <http://trac.symfony-project.org/changeset/33466?format=diff&new=33466>

Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (afaics there hasn't been
requested one for this issue yet during last month / from the start
of June 2012)

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

# Security Release: symfony 1.4.18 released

[Fabien Potencier](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/4aed4f5d-e0cb-4320-902f-885fddaa7d15)

symfony 1.4.18 has just been released. Read the post carefully as this version
fixes a security vulnerability.

Dmitri Groutso contacted us a couple of days ago about a possible security
issue in the session code:

"The `regenerate()` method as implemented by database backed session classes do
not persist the current session data from request memory before regenerating
session ID, leaving shadow copy in the database as it was at the beginning of
the request (still authenticated in the "logout" case). Passing to
`$destroy=true` to regenerate mitigates the attack, by explicitly removing
shadow copy."

His
[patch](http://trac.symfony-project.org/changeset/33466?format=diff&new=33466)
has been applied in the 1.4.18 release.

Here are all the changes from the
[CHANGELOG](http://trac.symfony-project.org/browser/tags/RELEASE_1_4_18/CHANGELOG):

* [33466] fixed a possible DB session fixation attack (patch from Dmitri Groutso)
* [33373] fixed test browser click function does not handle css selector without [ or ] (closes #9982, patch from mouette)

If you've checked out a copy of the tag from Subversion you can switch to the
latest version:

```
$ svn switch http://svn.symfony-project.com/tags/RELEASE_1_4_18

```

If you are using the PEAR package you can update using the pear command:

```
$ pear upgrade symfony/symfony-1.4.18

```

And as always, don't forget to clear your cache after upgrading.

[#1](/blog/security-release-symfony-1-4-18-released#comment-17482 "Permalink to this comment")

I've read this entry. But, sorry, I can't understand about this security issue.

I've confirmed an issue that some session storage classes don't remove old session data in logout cases. I think this issue will be fixed this patch.

But, your commit message says "session fixation". My said is about mitigation of session hijacking attack.

If this issue is categorized as "session fixation", I think the reporter's saying should be "The regenerate() method ... DO persist the current session data ... before regenerating session ID".

I want to know about more examples of effect by this vulnerability (?) to understand this problem certainly.

[#2](/blog/security-release-symfony-1-4-18-released#comment-17499 "Permalink to this comment")

But the problem with mysql 5.5 not understanding “Type=InnoDB” still exists. I had to change line 156 in
symfony-1.4/lib/plugins/sfPropelPlugin/lib/vendor/propel-generator/classes/propel/engine/builder/sql/mysql/MysqlDDLBuilder.php to
$script .= "Engine=$mysqlTableType";
manually.

[#3](/blog/security-release-symfony-1-4-18-released#comment-17500 "Permalink to this comment")

So, I've tried searching everywhere and asking asking on the IRC as well, but I've tried the pear upgrade on a git checkout version of a sf project and I'm getting back the "upgrade ok". However, symfony -V doesn't show the new version. The download of the new version was correct with pear as well. I've also cleared the cache.

Any ideas here?

I guess I could try and run a diff, but I'd much prefer to avoid this scenario. Cheers!
