Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how Symfony, a PHP web application development framework, handled session regeneration, specifically when using database-backed session storage. The `regenerate()` method, as implemented by database-backed session classes, did not persist the current session data from request memory before regenerating the session ID. This left a "shadow copy" of the session data in the database as it was at the beginning of the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The core issue is a session fixation vulnerability. The lack of proper session data persistence during session ID regeneration allows an attacker to potentially hijack a user's session.
*   **Inconsistent Session Data:**  When a user performs an action that changes their authentication status (e.g., logging in or out), the database may not reflect these changes immediately after a session ID regeneration if the current session data isn't saved first.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could exploit this by crafting a special URL that, when visited by a valid user, could result in the attacker gaining unauthorized access to the victim's user account. This is because the attacker could potentially control the session ID used by the victim, while the server uses the old session data.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By taking advantage of the "shadow copy", the attacker can potentially maintain control of the user's session even after the user has logged out or taken other actions to invalidate their session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted URLs:** The primary attack vector involves a remote attacker providing a specially crafted URL to the victim. This URL likely manipulates the session handling process, causing the described vulnerability to occur.
*  **Social engineering:** An attacker would need to trick a legitimate user into visiting a malicious URL to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote; they don't need to be on the same network or have direct access to the server.
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to visit the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Symfony version 1.4.18 by applying a patch. This patch ensures the current session data is saved before regenerating the session ID.
*   The original report of the vulnerability was made by Dmitri Groutso.
*   The fix involves passing `$destroy=true` to the regenerate method to remove the shadow copy and persisting current session data.
*   This vulnerability is specific to database-backed sessions in Symfony.
