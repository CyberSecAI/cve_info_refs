Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2494:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to downgrade the software version to a prior version. The affected ActiveX and Java components used for WebLaunch do not perform sufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Insufficient input validation in the ActiveX and Java components used for WebLaunch, allowing the installation of older software versions. This constitutes a software downgrade vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated remote attacker can force systems to download and install an older, potentially vulnerable version of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. Older versions could expose the system to additional vulnerabilities that were not present in the initial software version.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is initiated by convincing a user to visit a malicious web page and execute the vulnerable ActiveX control or Java applet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to host a malicious website with a vulnerable ActiveX control or Java applet, and convince a user to visit the website. The attacker does not require authentication. The attacker is remote.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability resides within the software update mechanism used for web-initiated deployments (WebLaunch).
- The vulnerable components are signed by Cisco, which may require little or no user interaction to execute depending on browser configuration.
- The vulnerability can affect systems that never installed Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client if the user interacts with a malicious website.
- The vulnerability is associated with Cisco Bug ID CSCtw48681.
- The advisory includes detailed information about affected versions and workarounds, including setting the kill-bit for ActiveX controls and blacklisting vulnerable Java applets using their SHA-1 message digests.
