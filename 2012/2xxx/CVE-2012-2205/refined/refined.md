Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the IBM Rational ClearQuest Web client. This vulnerability stems from how the web client handles user-supplied input, specifically within malformed query names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization within the ClearQuest Web client. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts into query names, which can then be executed within the browsers of other users of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could lead to several potential impacts:
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could steal cookies or session tokens, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially hijack user sessions and perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites or display fake login forms to harvest user credentials.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Malicious code can redirect to websites hosting malware.
*   **Website Defacement:**  Attackers could alter the visual presentation or content of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a specially formed query name that contains malicious JavaScript code. This crafted input is then injected into the application and executed within the browser of a user accessing the vulnerable part of the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the ClearQuest Web client and create/modify query names in order to inject the malicious payload.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft these malicious query names. The document mentions that this exact method of crafting is not publicly available.
*   The attacker needs a victim to access the compromised query.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to the web client; it does not affect the desktop clients or command-line utilities.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in ClearQuest versions 7.1.2.7 and 8.0.0.3 and later.
*   A workaround to mitigate the vulnerability is to use the ClearQuest desktop applications.
*   A mitigation to avoid the vulnerability in the web client is to examine text names in the ClearQuest Web client and not input or execute text names that attempt to execute JavaScript code.
*   The vulnerability can be tracked with the APAR number PM61670.
