RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

drm/i915: fix integer overflow in i915\_gem\_execbuffer2()

```
On 32-bit systems, a large args->buffer_count from userspace via ioctl
may overflow the allocation size, leading to out-of-bounds access.

This vulnerability was introduced in commit [8408c28](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8408c282f0cf34ee166df5f842f2861d245407fd) ("drm/i915:
First try a normal large kmalloc for the temporary exec buffers").

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

hfsplus: Fix potential buffer overflows
commit 6f24f892871acc47b40dd594c63606a17c714f77 upstream.
Commit ec81aecb2966 ("hfs: fix a potential buffer overflow") fixed a few
potential buffer overflows in the hfs filesystem. But as Timo Warns
pointed out, these changes also need to be made on the hfsplus
filesystem as well.

iwlwifi: fix hardware queue programming
commit 5ef4acd58ab2abd0dd0c8e3cacd61a0dc5d73646 upstream.
Newer devices have 20 (5000 series) or 30 (6000 series)
hardware queues, rather than the 16 that 4965 had. This
was added to the driver a long time ago, but improperly:
the queue registers for the higher queues aren't just
continuations of the registers for the first 16 queues,
they are in other places. Therefore, the hardware would
lock up when trying to activate queue 16 or above and
the device would have to be restarted.
Thanks goes to Emmanuel who identified this and told me
how the queue programming should be done.
Note that we don't use queues 20 and higher today and
doing so needs more work than this.

wl1251: fix crash on remove due to premature kfree
commit 328c32f0f85467af5a6c4c3289e168d9ad2555af upstream.
Currently SDIO glue frees it's own structure before calling
wl1251\_free\_hw(), which in turn calls ieee80211\_unregister\_hw().
The later call may result in a need to communicate with the chip
to stop it (as it happens now if the interface is still up before
rmmod), which means calls are made back to the glue, resulting in
freed memory access.
Fix this by freeing glue data last.

mac80211: fix AP mode EAP tx for VLAN stations
commit 66f2c99af3d6f2d0aa1120884cf1c60613ef61c0 upstream.
EAP frames for stations in an AP VLAN are sent on the main AP interface
to avoid race conditions wrt. moving stations.
For that to work properly, sta\_info\_get\_bss must be used instead of
sta\_info\_get when sending EAP packets.
Previously this was only done for cooked monitor injected packets, so
this patch adds a check for tx->skb->protocol to the same place.

ipw2200: Fix race condition in the command completion acknowledge
commit dd447319895d0c0af423e483d9b63f84f3f8869a upstream.
Driver incorrectly validates command completion: instead of waiting
for a command to be acknowledged it continues execution. Most of the
time driver gets acknowledge of the command completion in a tasklet
before it executes the next one. But sometimes it sends the next
command before it gets acknowledge for the previous one. In such a
case one of the following error messages appear in the log:
Failed to send SYSTEM\_CONFIG: Already sending a command.
Failed to send ASSOCIATE: Already sending a command.
Failed to send TX\_POWER: Already sending a command.
After that you need to reload the driver to get it working again.
This bug occurs during roaming (reported by Sam Varshavchik)
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=738508
and machine booting (reported by Tom Gundersen and Mads Kiilerich)
https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/28097
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=802106
This patch doesn't fix the delay issue during firmware load.
But at least device now works as usual after boot.

b43: only reload config after successful initialization
commit dbdedbdf4fbff3d4962a0786f37aa86dfdc48a7e upstream.
Commit 2a19032 (b43: reload phy and bss settings after core restarts)
introduced an unconditional call to b43\_op\_config() at the end of
b43\_op\_start(). When firmware fails to load this can wedge the system.
There's no need to reload the configuration after a failed
initialization anyway, so only make the call if initialization was
successful.

libata: skip old error history when counting probe trials
commit 6868225e3e92399068be9a5f1635752d91012ad5 upstream.
Commit d902747("[libata] Add ATA transport class") introduced
ATA\_EFLAG\_OLD\_ER to mark entries in the error ring as cleared.
But ata\_count\_probe\_trials\_cb() didn't check this flag and it still
counts the old error history. So wrong probe trials count is returned
and it causes problem, for example, SATA link speed is slowed down from
3.0Gbps to 1.5Gbps.
Fix it by checking ATA\_EFLAG\_OLD\_ER in ata\_count\_probe\_trials\_cb().

When create a raid5 using assume-clean and echo check or repair to

Because the judgement in function analyse\_stripe():
if (do\_recovery ||
sh->sector >= conf->mddev->recovery\_cp)
s->syncing = 1;
else
s->replacing = 1;
When check or repair,the recovery\_cp == MaxSectore,so syncing equal zero
not one.
This bug was introduced by commit 9a3e1101b827

exit\_signal: fix the "parent has changed security domain" logic
commit b6e238dceed36891cc633167afe7151f1f3d83c5 upstream.
exit\_notify() changes ->exit\_signal if the parent already did exec.
This doesn't really work, we are not going to send the signal now
if there is another live thread or the exiting task is traced. The
parent can exec before the last dies or the tracer detaches.
Move this check into do\_notify\_parent() which actually sends the
signal.
The user-visible change is that we do not change ->exit\_signal,
and thus the exiting task is still "clone children" for
do\_wait()->eligible\_child(\_\_WCLONE). Hopefully this is fine, the
current logic is racy anyway.

exit\_signal: simplify the "we have changed execution domain" logic
commit e636825346b36a07ccfc8e30946d52855e21f681 upstream.
exit\_notify() checks "tsk->self\_exec\_id != tsk->parent\_exec\_id"
to handle the "we have changed execution domain" case.
We can change do\_thread() to always set ->exit\_signal = SIGCHLD
and remove this check to simplify the code.
We could change setup\_new\_exec() instead, this looks more logical
because it increments ->self\_exec\_id. But note that de\_thread()
already resets ->exit\_signal if it changes the leader, let's keep
both changes close to each other.
Note that we change ->exit\_signal lockless, this changes the rules.
Thereafter ->exit\_signal is not stable under tasklist but this is
fine, the only possible change is OLDSIG -> SIGCHLD. This can race
with eligible\_child() but the race is harmless. We can race with
reparent\_leader() which changes our ->exit\_signal in parallel, but
it does the same change to SIGCHLD.
The noticeable user-visible change is that the execing task is not
"visible" to do\_wait()->eligible\_child(\_\_WCLONE) right after exec.
To me this looks more logical, and this is consistent with mt case.

Various people reported nohz load tracking still being wrecked, but Doug
spotted the actual problem. We fold the nohz remainder in too soon,
causing us to loose samples and under-account.
So instead of playing catch-up up-front, always do a single load-fold
with whatever state we encounter and only then fold the nohz remainder
and play catch-up.

PM / Hibernate: fix the number of pages used for hibernate/thaw buffering
commit f8262d476823a7ea1eb497ff9676d1eab2393c75 upstream.
Hibernation regression fix, since 3.2.
Calculate the number of required free pages based on non-high memory
pages only, because that is where the buffers will come from.
Commit 081a9d043c983f161b78fdc4671324d1342b86bc introduced a new buffer
page allocation logic during hibernation, in order to improve the
performance. The amount of pages allocated was calculated based on total
amount of pages available, although only non-high memory pages are
usable for this purpose. This caused hibernation code to attempt to over
allocate pages on platforms that have high memory, which led to hangs.

powerpc/85xx: don't call of\_platform\_bus\_probe() twice
commit 8a95bc8dfe06982fc2b8a0a2adda7baa2346a17b upstream.
Commit 46d026ac ("powerpc/85xx: consolidate of\_platform\_bus\_probe calls")
replaced platform-specific of\_device\_id tables with a single function
that probes the most of the busses in 85xx device trees. If a specific
platform needed additional busses probed, then it could call
of\_platform\_bus\_probe() again. Typically, the additional platform-specific
busses are children of existing busses that have already been probed.
of\_platform\_bus\_probe() does not handle those child busses automatically.
Unfortunately, this doesn't actually work. The second (platform-specific)
call to of\_platform\_bus\_probe() never finds any of the busses it's asked
to find.
To remedy this, the platform-specific of\_device\_id tables are eliminated,
and their entries are merged into mpc85xx\_common\_ids[], so that all busses
are probed at once.

x86, efi: Add dedicated EFI stub entry point
commit b1994304fc399f5d3a5368c81111d713490c4799 upstream.
The method used to work out whether we were booted by EFI firmware or
via a boot loader is broken. Because efi\_main() is always executed
when booting from a boot loader we will dereference invalid pointers
either on the stack (CONFIG\_X86\_32) or contained in %rdx
(CONFIG\_X86\_64) when searching for an EFI System Table signature.
Instead of dereferencing these invalid system table pointers, add a
new entry point that is only used when booting from EFI firmware, when
we know the pointer arguments will be valid. With this change legacy
boot loaders will no longer execute efi\_main(), but will instead skip
EFI stub initialisation completely.
[ hpa: Marking this for urgent/stable since it is a regression when
the option is enabled; without the option the patch has no effect ]

x86, boot: Correct CFLAGS for hostprogs
commit 446e1c86d51d0823e003a43a2b85c430efce2733 upstream.
This is a partial revert of commit:
d40f833 "Restrict CFLAGS for hostprogs"
The endian-manipulation macros in tools/include need ,
but the hostprogs in arch/x86/boot need several headers from the
kernel build tree, which means we have to add the kernel headers to
the include path. This picks up  from the kernel tree,
which gives a warning.
Since this use of  is intentional, add
-D\_\_EXPORTED\_HEADERS\_\_ to the command line to silence the warning.
A better way to fix this would be to always install the exported
kernel headers into $(objtree)/usr/include as a standard part of the
kernel build, but that is a lot more involved.

x86, efi: Fix endian issues and unaligned accesses
commit 92f42c50f227ad228f815a8f4eec872524dae3a5 upstream.
We may need to convert the endianness of the data we read from/write
to 'buf', so let's use {get,put}\_unaligned\_le32() to do that. Failure
to do so can result in accessing invalid memory, leading to a
segfault. Stephen Rothwell noticed this bug while cross-building an
x86\_64 allmodconfig kernel on PowerPC.
We need to read from and write to 'buf' a byte at a time otherwise
it's possible we'll perform an unaligned access, which can lead to bus
errors when cross-building an x86 kernel on risc architectures.

commit d40f833630a1299fd377408dc8d8fac370d621b0 upstream.
Currently tools/build has access to all the kernel headers in

tools/build to erroneously include kernel headers when it should only
be including userspace-exported headers.
Unfortunately, mkcpustr still needs access to some of the asm kernel
headers, so explicitly special case that hostprog.

commit fec6c20b570bcf541e581fc97f2e0cbdb9725b98 upstream.
A common flaw in UEFI systems is a refusal to POST triggered by a malformed
boot variable. Once in this state, machines may only be restored by
reflashing their firmware with an external hardware device. While this is
obviously a firmware bug, the serious nature of the outcome suggests that
operating systems should filter their variable writes in order to prevent
a malicious user from rendering the machine unusable.

ARM: 7406/1: hotplug: copy the affinity mask when forcefully migrating IRQs
commit 5e7371ded05adfcfcee44a8bc070bfc37979b8f2 upstream.
When a CPU is hotplugged off, we migrate any IRQs currently affine to it
away and onto another online CPU by calling the irq\_set\_affinity
function of the relevant interrupt controller chip. This function
returns either IRQ\_SET\_MASK\_OK or IRQ\_SET\_MASK\_OK\_NOCOPY, to indicate
whether irq\_data.affinity was updated.
If we are forcefully migrating an interrupt (because the affinity mask
no longer identifies any online CPUs) then we should update the IRQ
affinity mask to reflect the new CPU set. Failure to do so can
potentially leave /proc/irq/n/smp\_affinity identifying only offline
CPUs, which may confuse userspace IRQ balancing daemons.
This patch updates migrate\_one\_irq to copy the affinity mask when
the interrupt chip returns IRQ\_SET\_MASK\_OK after forcefully changing the
affinity of an interrupt.

ARM: 7403/1: tls: remove covert channel via TPIDRURW
commit 6a1c53124aa161eb624ce7b1e40ade728186d34c upstream.
TPIDRURW is a user read/write register forming part of the group of
thread registers in more recent versions of the ARM architecture (~v6+).
Currently, the kernel does not touch this register, which allows tasks
to communicate covertly by reading and writing to the register without
context-switching affecting its contents.
This patch clears TPIDRURW when TPIDRURO is updated via the set\_tls
macro, which is called directly from \_\_switch\_to. Since the current
behaviour makes the register useless to userspace as far as thread
pointers are concerned, simply clearing the register (rather than saving
and restoring it) will not cause any problems to userspace.

ARM: 7396/1: errata: only handle ARM erratum #326103 on affected cores
commit f0c4b8d653f5ee091fb8d4d02ed7eaad397491bb upstream.
Erratum #326103 ("FSR write bit incorrect on a SWP to read-only memory")
only affects the ARM 1136 core prior to r1p0. The workaround
disassembles the faulting instruction to determine whether it was a read
or write access on all v6 cores.
An issue has been reported on the ARM 11MPCore whereby loading the
faulting instruction may happen in parallel with that page being
unmapped, resulting in a deadlock due to the lack of TLB broadcasting
in hardware:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2012-March/091561.html
This patch limits the workaround so that it is only used on affected
cores, which are known to be UP only. Other v6 cores can rely on the
FSR to indicate the access type correctly.

autofs: make the autofsv5 packet file descriptor use a packetized pipe
commit 64f371bc3107e69efce563a3d0f0e6880de0d537 upstream.
The autofs packet size has had a very unfortunate size problem on x86:
because the alignment of 'u64' differs in 32-bit and 64-bit modes, and
because the packet data was not 8-byte aligned, the size of the autofsv5
packet structure differed between 32-bit and 64-bit modes despite
looking otherwise identical (300 vs 304 bytes respectively).
We first fixed that up by making the 64-bit compat mode know about this
problem in commit a32744d4abae ("autofs: work around unhappy compat
problem on x86-64"), and that made a 32-bit 'systemd' work happily on a
64-bit kernel because everything then worked the same way as on a 32-bit
kernel.
But it turned out that 'automount' had actually known and worked around
this problem in user space, so fixing the kernel to do the proper 32-bit
compatibility handling actually \*broke\* 32-bit automount on a 64-bit
kernel, because it knew that the packet sizes were wrong and expected
those incorrect sizes.
As a result, we ended up reverting that compatibility mode fix, and
thus breaking systemd again, in commit fcbf94b9dedd.
With both automount and systemd doing a single read() system call, and
verifying that they get \*exactly\* the size they expect but using
different sizes, it seemed that fixing one of them inevitably seemed to
break the other. At one point, a patch I seriously considered applying
from Michael Tokarev did a "strcmp()" to see if it was automount that
was doing the operation. Ugly, ugly.
However, a prettier solution exists now thanks to the packetized pipe
mode. By marking the communication pipe as being packetized (by simply
setting the O\_DIRECT flag), we can always just write the bigger packet
size, and if user-space does a smaller read, it will just get that
partial end result and the extra alignment padding will simply be thrown
away.
This makes both automount and systemd happy, since they now get the size
they asked for, and the kernel side of autofs simply no longer needs to
care - it could pad out the packet arbitrarily.
Of course, if there is some \*other\* user of autofs (please, please,
please tell me it ain't so - and we haven't heard of any) that tries to
read the packets with multiple writes, that other user will now be
broken - the whole point of the packetized mode is that one system call
gets exactly one packet, and you cannot read a packet in pieces.

pipes: add a "packetized pipe" mode for writing
commit 9883035ae7edef3ec62ad215611cb8e17d6a1a5d upstream.
The actual internal pipe implementation is already really about
individual packets (called "pipe buffers"), and this simply exposes that
as a special packetized mode.
When we are in the packetized mode (marked by O\_DIRECT as suggested by
Alan Cox), a write() on a pipe will not merge the new data with previous
writes, so each write will get a pipe buffer of its own. The pipe
buffer is then marked with the PIPE\_BUF\_FLAG\_PACKET flag, which in turn
will tell the reader side to break the read at that boundary (and throw
away any partial packet contents that do not fit in the read buffer).
End result: as long as you do writes less than PIPE\_BUF in size (so that
the pipe doesn't have to split them up), you can now treat the pipe as a
packet interface, where each read() system call will read one packet at
a time. You can just use a sufficiently big read buffer (PIPE\_BUF is
sufficient, since bigger than that doesn't guarantee atomicity anyway),
and the return value of the read() will naturally give you the size of
the packet.
NOTE! We do not support zero-sized packets, and zero-sized reads and
writes to a pipe continue to be no-ops. Also note that big packets will
currently be split at write time, but that the size at which that
happens is not really specified (except that it's bigger than PIPE\_BUF).
Currently that limit is the system page size, but we might want to
explicitly support bigger packets some day.
The main user for this is going to be the autofs packet interface,
allowing us to stop having to care so deeply about exact packet sizes
(which have had bugs with 32/64-bit compatibility modes). But user
space can create packetized pipes with "pipe2(fd, O\_DIRECT)", which will
fail with an EINVAL on kernels that do not support this interface.

USB: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS computers
commit 151b61284776be2d6f02d48c23c3625678960b97 upstream.
This patch (as1545) fixes a problem affecting several ASUS computers:
The machine crashes or corrupts memory when going into suspend if the
ehci-hcd driver is bound to any controllers. Users have been forced
to unbind or unload ehci-hcd before putting their systems to sleep.
After extensive testing, it was determined that the machines don't
like going into suspend when any EHCI controllers are in the PCI D3
power state. Presumably this is a firmware bug, but there's nothing
we can do about it except to avoid putting the controllers in D3
during system sleep.
The patch adds a new flag to indicate whether the problem is present,
and avoids changing the controller's power state if the flag is set.
Runtime suspend is unaffected; this matters only for system suspend.
However as a side effect, the controller will not respond to remote
wakeup requests while the system is asleep. Hence USB wakeup is not
functional -- but of course, this is already true in the current state
of affairs.
This fixes Bugzilla #42728.

Clearing bit 5 of CACHE\_MODE\_0 is necessary to prevent GPU hangs in

This cannot be done in gen6\_init\_clock\_gating with most of the other

register write gets dropped on the floor (one printk will show it
changed, but a second printk immediately following shows the value
reverts to the old one).

drm/i915: handle input/output sdvo timings separately in mode\_set
commit 6651819b4b4fc3caa6964c5d825eb4bb996f3905 upstream.
We seem to have a decent confusion between the output timings and the
input timings of the sdvo encoder. If I understand the code correctly,
we use the original mode unchanged for the output timings, safe for
the lvds case. And we should use the adjusted mode for input timings.
Clarify the situation by adding an explicit output\_dtd to the sdvo
mode\_set function and streamline the code-flow by moving the input and
output mode setting in the sdvo encode together.
Furthermore testing showed that the sdvo input timing needs the
unadjusted dotclock, the sdvo chip will automatically compute the
required pixel multiplier to get a dotclock above 100 MHz.
Fix this up when converting a drm mode to an sdvo dtd.

Due to questions raised in review, below a more elaborate analysis of
the bug at hand:
Sdvo seems to have two timings, one is the output timing which will be
sent over whatever is connected on the other side of the sdvo chip (panel,
hdmi screen, tv), the other is the input timing which will be generated by
the gmch pipe. It looks like sdvo is expected to scale between the two.
To make things slightly more complicated, we have a bunch of special
cases:
- For lvds panel we always use a fixed output timing, namely
intel\_sdvo->sdvo\_lvds\_fixed\_mode, hence that special case.
- Sdvo has an interface to generate a preferred input timing for a given
output timing. This is the confusing thing that I've tried to clear up
with the follow-on patches.
- A special requirement is that the input pixel clock needs to be between
100MHz and 200MHz (likely to keep it within the electromechanical design
range of PCIe), 270MHz on later gen4+. Lower pixel clocks are
doubled/quadrupled.
The thing this patch tries to fix is that the pipe needs to be
explicitly instructed to double/quadruple the pixels and needs the
correspondingly higher pixel clock, whereas the sdvo adaptor seems to
do that itself and needs the unadjusted pixel clock. For the sdvo
encode side we already set the pixel mutliplier with a different
command (0x21).
This patch tries to fix this mess by:
- Keeping the output mode timing in the unadjusted plain mode, safe
for the lvds case.
- Storing the input timing in the adjusted\_mode with the adjusted
pixel clock. This way we don't need to frob around with the core
crtc mode set code.
- Fixing up the pixelclock when constructing the sdvo dtd timing
struct. This is why the first hunk of the patch is an integral part
of the series.
- Dropping the is\_tv special case because input\_dtd is equivalent to
adjusted\_mode after these changes. Follow-up patches clear this up
further (by simply ripping out intel\_sdvo->input\_dtd because it's
not needed).

hwmon: fam15h\_power: fix bogus values with current BIOSes
commit 00250ec90963b7ef6678438888f3244985ecde14 upstream.
Newer BKDG[1] versions recommend a different initialization value for
the running average range register in the northbridge. This improves
the power reading by avoiding counter saturations resulting in bogus
values for anything below about 80% of TDP power consumption.
Updated BIOSes will have this new value set up from the beginning,
but meanwhile we correct this value ourselves.
This needs to be done on all northbridges, even on those where the
driver itself does not register at.
This fixes the driver on all current machines to provide proper
values for idle load.

tracing: Fix stacktrace of latency tracers (irqsoff and friends)
commit db4c75cbebd7e5910cd3bcb6790272fcc3042857 upstream.
While debugging a latency with someone on IRC (mirage335) on #linux-rt (OFTC),
we discovered that the stacktrace output of the latency tracers
(preemptirqsoff) was empty.
This bug was caused by the creation of the dynamic length stack trace
again (like commit 12b5da3 "tracing: Fix ent\_size in trace output" was).
This bug is caused by the latency tracers requiring the next event
to determine the time between the current event and the next. But by
grabbing the next event, the iter->ent\_size is set to the next event
instead of the current one. As the stacktrace event is the last event,
this makes the ent\_size zero and causes nothing to be printed for
the stack trace. The dynamic stacktrace uses the ent\_size to determine
how much of the stack can be printed. The ent\_size of zero means
no stack.
The simple fix is to save the iter->ent\_size before finding the next event.
Note, mirage335 asked to remain anonymous from LKML and git, so I will
not add the Reported-by and Tested-by tags, even though he did report
the issue and tested the fix.

dmaengine: at\_hdmac: remove clear-on-read in atc\_dostart()
commit ed8b0d67f33518a16c6b2450fe5ebebf180c2d04 upstream.
This loop on EBCISR register was designed to clear IRQ sources before enabling
a DMA channel. This register is clear-on-read so a race condition can appear if
another channel is already active and has just finished its transfer.
Removing this read on EBCISR is fixing the issue as there is no case where an IRQ
could be pending: we already make sure that this register is drained at probe()
time and during resume.

When we boot on a machine that can hotplug CPUs and we
are using 'dom0\_max\_vcpus=X' on the Xen hypervisor line
to clip the amount of CPUs available to the initial domain,
we get this:

xen: correctly check for pending events when restoring irq flags
commit 7eb7ce4d2e8991aff4ecb71a81949a907ca755ac upstream.
In xen\_restore\_fl\_direct(), xen\_force\_evtchn\_callback() was being
called even if no events were pending. This resulted in (depending on
workload) about a 100 times as many xen\_version hypercalls as
necessary.
Fix this by correcting the sense of the conditional jump.
This seems to give a significant performance benefit for some
workloads.
There is some subtle tricksy "..since the check here is trying to
check both pending and masked in a single cmpw, but I think this is
correct. It will call check\_events now only when the combined
mask+pending word is 0x0001 (aka unmasked, pending)." (Ian)

Revert "autofs: work around unhappy compat problem on x86-64"
commit fcbf94b9dedd2ce08e798a99aafc94fec8668161 upstream.
This reverts commit a32744d4abae24572eff7269bc17895c41bd0085.
While that commit was technically the right thing to do, and made the
x86-64 compat mode work identically to native 32-bit mode (and thus
fixing the problem with a 32-bit systemd install on a 64-bit kernel), it
turns out that the automount binaries had workarounds for this compat
problem.
Now, the workarounds are disgusting: doing an "uname()" to find out the
architecture of the kernel, and then comparing it for the 64-bit cases
and fixing up the size of the read() in automount for those. And they
were confused: it's not actually a generic 64-bit issue at all, it's
very much tied to just x86-64, which has different alignment for an
'u64' in 64-bit mode than in 32-bit mode.
But the end result is that fixing the compat layer actually breaks the
case of a 32-bit automount on a x86-64 kernel.
There are various approaches to fix this (including just doing a
"strcmp()" on current->comm and comparing it to "automount"), but I
think that I will do the one that teaches pipes about a special "packet
mode", which will allow user space to not have to care too deeply about
the padding at the end of the autofs packet.
That change will make the compat workaround unnecessary, so let's revert
it first, and get automount working again in compat mode. The
packetized pipes will then fix autofs for systemd.

x86/platform: Remove incorrect error message in x86\_default\_fixup\_cpu\_id()
commit 68894632afb2729a1d8785c877840953894c7283 upstream.
It's only called from amd.c:srat\_detect\_node(). The introduced
condition for calling the fixup code is true for all AMD
multi-node processors, e.g. Magny-Cours and Interlagos. There we
have 2 NUMA nodes on one socket. Thus there are cores having
different numa-node-id but with equal phys\_proc\_id.
There is no point to print error messages in such a situation.
The confusing/misleading error message was introduced with
commit 64be4c1c2428e148de6081af235e2418e6a66dda ("x86: Add
x86\_init platform override to fix up NUMA core numbering").
Remove the default fixup function (especially the error message)
and replace it by a NULL pointer check, move the
Numascale-specific condition for calling the fixup into the
fixup-function itself and slightly adapt the comment.

x86, apic: APIC code touches invalid MSR on P5 class machines
commit cbf2829b61c136edcba302a5e1b6b40e97d32c00 upstream.
Current APIC code assumes MSR\_IA32\_APICBASE is present for all systems.
Pentium Classic P5 and friends didn't have this MSR. MSR\_IA32\_APICBASE
was introduced as an architectural MSR by Intel @ P6.
Code paths that can touch this MSR invalidly are when vendor == Intel &&
cpu-family == 5 and APIC bit is set in CPUID - or when you simply pass
lapic on the kernel command line, on a P5.
The below patch stops Linux incorrectly interfering with the
MSR\_IA32\_APICBASE for P5 class machines. Other code paths exist that
touch the MSR - however those paths are not currently reachable for a
conformant P5.

# RHSA-2012:1156 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1156)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues and several bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* An integer overflow flaw was found in the i915\_gem\_execbuffer2() function

in the Intel i915 driver in the Linux kernel. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected
32-bit systems. (CVE-2012-2383, Moderate)

* A missing initialization flaw was found in the sco\_sock\_getsockopt\_old()

function in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth implementation. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause an information leak.
(CVE-2011-1078, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting the
CVE-2011-1078 issue.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.
