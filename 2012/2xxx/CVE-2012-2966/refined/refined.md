Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2966:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `www.kb.cert.org` directly references CVE-2012-2966 and provides a description of the vulnerability.
*   The content from `caucho.com` provides a changelog for Resin versions including version 4.0.29, which the CERT advisory indicates as addressing the vulnerability.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper handling of POST request parameters within Caucho's Quercus PHP engine on Resin. Specifically, parameters sent via POST requests become global variables, and \_SERVER array items may be overwritten. This is a flaw in how the application handles HTTP parameters, making it vulnerable to variable manipulation by an attacker.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Variables Globalization:** POST parameters are made global in scope.
*   **\_SERVER Array Overwriting:** POST parameters can overwrite items within the \_SERVER array, a critical component of PHP's environment variables. This overwriting of server variables can lead to unexpected behaviors and potentially allow for other attacks.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker could potentially achieve:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By manipulating global variables and \_SERVER array items, an attacker might be able to influence program flow and execute code with the privileges of the web application.
    *   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Overwritten environment variables could potentially leak sensitive information.
    *   **Denial of Service:** By manipulating server state, an attacker may be able to trigger application errors or conditions that could lead to denial of service.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   No specific privileges or access to the server or network is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `caucho.com` content provides a comprehensive changelog, detailing a large number of fixes in various Resin releases, offering a wider context of Resin's development and issue resolution process. However, it does not directly explain this particular vulnerability.
*   The `www.kb.cert.org` content provides a higher-level summary of the vulnerability, including information about affected vendors, CVSS scores, and links to further references.
*   The CERT advisory also includes references to related CVEs (CVE-2012-2965, CVE-2012-2967, CVE-2012-2968, CVE-2012-2969) indicating a broader scope of vulnerabilities in Quercus on Resin.
