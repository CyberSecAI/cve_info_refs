Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-2934:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an issue with older AMD CPUs that can be triggered by AMD processor erratum #121, causing the processor to lock up.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The root cause is an AMD processor erratum, specifically #121.
*   Xen does not detect old AMD CPUs affected by this erratum.
*  The erratum can be triggered by a specific sequence of instructions when running 64 bit PV guests on vulnerable processors

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A guest user or administrator of a 64-bit PV guest can cause the processor to lock up leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack against the host system.
*   This can result in a complete system freeze/halt on affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local to the host system, originating from a 64-bit PV (Paravirtualized) guest.
*   An attacker needs the ability to run code within a 64-bit PV guest on a vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have either user or administrator level access to a 64-bit PV guest.
*   The host system must be running on one of the vulnerable AMD processors.
*   The attacker must execute specific instructions within the 64-bit PV guest to trigger the erratum.

**Vulnerable Systems:**

*   130nm and 90nm (DDR1-only) AMD processors, specifically:
    *   First-generation AMD-Opteron(tm) single and dual-core processors (100, 200, and 800 series).
    *   AMD Athlon(tm) processors.
    *   AMD Sempron(tm) processors.
    *   AMD Turion(tm) Mobile Technology.
*   Systems running 64 bit PV guest kernels are vulnerable

**Mitigation:**

*   Running a 64-bit PV guest kernel with the fix for erratum #121 will prevent unprivileged users in guests from exploiting the issue.
*   The vulnerability is not present on 32 bit PV guest kernels or on HVM Xen guests.
*   Xen can be configured to refuse to start DomUs on affected systems unless the "allow_unsafe" option is passed, allowing mitigation or acceptance of risk.

**Resolution:**

*   There is no software fix for the underlying AMD erratum.
*   Xen was updated to detect vulnerable systems and refuse to boot unless an override is used.
*   The Xen update includes a command line override "allow_unsafe" for users who accept the risks or have other mitigations in place.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also mentions that the issue was discovered during testing of the fix for XSA-7 (CVE-2012-0217), though the two issues are unrelated.
*   The vulnerability does not affect Intel processors.
*   Several Linux distributions are mentioned as having addressed the issue in their Xen packages.
