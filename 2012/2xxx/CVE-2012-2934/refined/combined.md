Previous versions were embargoed.  Remove leftover statement that CVE number had not been assigned. The correct CVE for this issue is CVE-2012-2934.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  A Xen user has discovered that some older AMD CPUs can be made to lock up due to AMD processor erratum #121.  This issue was discovered during testing of the fix for XSA-7 (CVE-2012-0217). Although the two issues are unrelated the situations which can trigger them may overlap.  REFERENCES ==========  AMD Erratum #121 is described in "Revision Guide for AMD Athlon 64 and AMD Opteron Processors": <http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/25759.pdf>  IMPACT ======  A guest user or administrator of a 64 bit PV guest on a vulnerable system can cause the processor to lock up, leading to a Denial of Service attack against the host.  Systems which run only 32 bit guest kernels are not vulnerable.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  The following 130nm and 90nm (DDR1-only) AMD processors are subject to this erratum:   * First-generation AMD-Opteron(tm) single and dual core processors    in either 939 or 940 packages:    * AMD Opteron(tm) 100-Series Processors    * AMD Opteron(tm) 200-Series Processors    * AMD Opteron(tm) 800-Series Processors  * AMD Athlon(tm) processors in either 754, 939 or 940 packages  * AMD Sempron(tm) processor in either 754 or 939 packages  * AMD Turion(tm) Mobile Technology in 754 package  None of the affected processors support AMD SVM.  Therefore, any system which has any HVM Xen guests is not vulnerable.  This issue does not affect Intel processors.  MITIGATION ==========  Running a 64 bit PV guest kernel (which must necessarily be host administrator controlled) which itself contains the fix for erratum #121 will prevent unprivileged users in guests from exploiting this issue.  All Windows operating systems and current versions of the Linux and Solaris kernels, for example, are known to contain the fix for erratum #121.  There is no mitigation when running untrusted 64 bit guest kernels or against untrusted administrators of 64 bit guests.  Systems which run only 32 bit PV guest kernels are not vulnerable. Note that this may mean only booting known good kernels or vetting any user supplied kernels to ensure they are not 64 bit.  RESOLUTION ==========  There is no software fix for this issue. The workaround suggested by AMD in erratum #121 cannot be applied to Xen since the relevant address is under guest control.  Applying the patch will cause Xen to detect vulnerable systems and refuse to boot. A command line override is provided to allow users who accept the risks or who are able to mitigate as above to continue to do so. To activate the override add "allow_unsafe" to your hypervisor command line.

Package        : xen
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0217 CVE-2012-0218 CVE-2012-2934

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Xen, a hypervisor.

CVE-2012-0217
	Xen does not properly handle uncanonical return addresses on
	Intel amd64 CPUs, allowing amd64 PV guests to elevate to
	hypervisor privileges.  AMD processors, HVM and i386 guests
	are not affected.

CVE-2012-0218
	Xen does not properly handle SYSCALL and SYSENTER instructions
	in PV guests, allowing unprivileged users inside a guest
	system to crash the guest system.

CVE-2012-2934
	Xen does not detect old AMD CPUs affected by AMD Erratum #121.

For CVE-2012-2934, Xen refuses to start domUs on affected systems
unless the "allow_unsafe" option is passed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.1-5.2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version
4.1.3~rc1+hg-20120614.a9c0a89c08f2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
