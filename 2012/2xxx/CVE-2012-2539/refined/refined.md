Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2012-2539:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the way Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted Rich Text Format (RTF) data. Specifically, a flaw in processing the `listoverridecount` field within RTF files allows for memory corruption, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper parsing of RTF data, specifically the `listoverridecount` field.
- Memory corruption vulnerability, allowing for remote code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user who opened the malicious RTF file or email.
- Complete system control: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer user rights are less impacted but still at risk.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email:** Attackers can send specially crafted RTF-formatted data in the content of an email message. The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious email is previewed or opened in Outlook using Microsoft Word as the email viewer. Attackers can also send malicious RTF files as attachments.
- **Web-based attacks:** Attackers can host websites containing malicious RTF files to exploit the vulnerability. Compromised websites or sites accepting user-provided content could also contain this malicious content. The attacker needs to convince users to visit these websites or open the malicious RTF file.
- Vulnerability is also exploitable through SharePoint servers that allow conversion of Word files using Word Automation Services

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious RTF file to the victim either through email or by hosting it on a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious RTF file or email.
- No special privileges on the victim's system are needed before exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- Microsoft rated the vulnerability as Critical for Microsoft Word 2007 and 2010, and Important for Word 2003, Word Viewer, Office Compatibility Pack, and Office Web Apps.
- The vulnerability was privately reported to Microsoft.
- Microsoft released security updates to address this vulnerability, which modifies the way that Microsoft Office parses RTF-formatted data.
- Workarounds included reading emails in plain text format and using the Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources.
- The exploitability index was rated as 0, indicating that Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited, and requires the highest priority.
