## osCommerce v2.3.1 with PayPal website payments standard module v1.0 design vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#459446

Original Release Date: 2012-09-18 | Last Revised: 2013-05-15

---

### Overview

osCommerce 2.3.1 and possibly other versions with the PayPal website payments standard module is susceptible to a client-side attack that results in an attacker purchasing items without having to pay for them.

### Description

| It has been reported that osCommerce 2.3.1 using the PayPal website payments standard module 1.0 contains a design flaw that allows an attacker to buy items without having to pay for them. The parameter for the merchant's PayPal email address is controlled on the client-side and not verified by the server. This allows an attacker to change the PayPal email address to one the attacker controls allowing the attacker to purchase items on a website but effectively pay themselves instead of the merchant. Manual verification of website orders with the PayPal transactions would need to be performed to detect this fraud. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can effectively purchase items without paying the merchant for them. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3.4 and v1.1 of the payment module will be released to address this issue. If you are unable to update, please consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| Enable Encrypted Web Payments in the payment module configuration. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
