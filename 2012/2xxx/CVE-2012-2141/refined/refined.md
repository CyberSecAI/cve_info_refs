  "CVE-2012-2141": {
    "description": "An array index error, leading to out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way net-snmp agent performed entries lookup in the extension table. When certain MIB subtree was handled by the extend directive, a remote attacker having read privilege to the subtree could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (snmpd crash) via SNMP GET request involving a non-existent extension table entry.",
    "root_cause": "An array index error in the net-snmp agent when looking up entries in the extension table.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Array index error leading to an out-of-bounds heap-based buffer read."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (snmpd crash).",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability via a crafted SNMP GET request.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires read privilege to a specific MIB subtree handled by the 'extend' directive within the snmpd configuration."
