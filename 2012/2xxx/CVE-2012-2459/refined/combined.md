# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

## CVE-2010-5140

Summary: Never confirming transactions
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.

An attackercould isolate a victim's node and cause the creation of blockchainforks.Because this bug could be exploited to severely disrupt the Bitcoinnetwork we consider this a critical vulnerability, and encourageeverybody to upgrade to the latest version: 0.6.2.Backports for older releases (0.5.5 and 0.4.6) are also available ifyou cannot upgrade to version 0.6.2.Full technical details are being withheld to give people theopportunity to upgrade.Thanks to Forrest Voight for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.Questions that might be frequently asked:How would I know if I am the victim of this attack?Your bitcoin process would stop processing blocks and would have adifferent block count from the rest of the network (you can see thecurrent block count at websites like blockexplorer.com orblockchain.info).  Eventually it would display the message:"WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct!  You may need toupgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade."(note that this message is displayed whenever your bitcoin processdetects that the rest of the network seems to have a differentblock count, which can happen for several reasons unrelated tothis vulnerability).Could this bug be used to steal my wallet?No.Could this bug be used to install malware on my system?No.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (Darwin)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9L8G-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   How often do you get the chance to work on a potentially world-changing project? | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

An attackercould isolate a victim's node and cause the creation of blockchainforks.Because this bug could be exploited to severely disrupt the Bitcoinnetwork we consider this a critical vulnerability, and encourageeverybody to upgrade to the latest version: 0.6.2.Backports for older releases (0.5.5 and 0.4.6) are also available ifyou cannot upgrade to version 0.6.2.Full technical details are being withheld to give people theopportunity to upgrade.Thanks to Forrest Voight for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.Questions that might be frequently asked:How would I know if I am the victim of this attack?Your bitcoin process would stop processing blocks and would have adifferent block count from the rest of the network (you can see thecurrent block count at websites like blockexplorer.com orblockchain.info).  Eventually it would display the message:"WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct!  You may need toupgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade."(note that this message is displayed whenever your bitcoin processdetects that the rest of the network seems to have a differentblock count, which can happen for several reasons unrelated tothis vulnerability).Could this bug be used to steal my wallet?No.Could this bug be used to install malware on my system?No.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (Darwin)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9L8G-----END PGP SIGNATURE----- | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   How often do you get the chance to work on a potentially world-changing project? | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

For example, merkle\_hash([a, b, c]) and merkle\_hash([a, b, c, c]) yield the same result. This is because, at every iteration, the Merkle hash function pads its intermediate list of hashes with the last hash if the list is of odd length, in order to make it of even length.And so, the Merkle root function can be effectively preimaged by changing the input so that one of the intermediate lists is of even length with the last two elements equal (where originally it was of odd length with a last element equal to the earlier mentioned two). As was later noted, this extends to any input length that is not a power of two: merkle\_hash([a, b, c, d, e, f]) == merkle\_hash([a, b, c, d, e, f, e, f]). Note that to maintain the same root hash, the only flexibility that exists is duplication of elements.As a result, two blocks can easily be created that have the same block hash, though one can be valid and the other invalid, by duplicating one or more of the transactions in a way that maintains the Merkle root hash. Duplicating any transaction will make the block invalid, since the block double spends a certain past transaction output.An unpatched Bitcoin installation can be permanently wedged at its current highest block using this and the fact that Bitcoin caches orphan blocks in a disk-backed database. To do so, the attacker must send it a valid block (that will eventually make it into the blockchain) made invalid by duplicating one of the transactions in a way that preserves the Merkle root. The attacker doesn't even need to mine their own block - instead, they can listen for a block, then mutate it in this way, and pass it on to their peers.Once the victim receives this invalid block, they will cache it on disk, attempt to process it, and reject it as invalid. Re-requestingthe block will not be even attempted since Bitcoin believes that it already has the block, since it has one with the same hash. Bitcoin eventually displays the "WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct!  You may need to upgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade." warning when the blockchain extends further beyond the received invalid block.The problem was fixed by Gavin Andresen in Bitcoin commit be8651d [1] by rejecting blocks with duplicate transactions in CheckBlock, preventing them from being cached at all.Cheers,Forrest Voight<http://forre.st/>[1]: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/be8651dde7b59e50e8c443da71c706667803d06d> | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   1J1zegkNSbwX4smvTdoHSanUfwvXFeuV23 | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

An attacker could have used this exploit against a number of large miners (say about 40% or so) and exchanges to pull off any number of double-spend attacks until the miners noticed they had been forked and fixed their bitcoind. That is, the attacker could easily hijack as much of the miners has he wanted for his own purposes **including phony 6+ confirmation transactions**. On a more subtle level, the attacker could target certain blocks they wanted orphans by performing this attack on a majority of miners with the "tip" block he wanted orphaned.This vulnerability is also the reason why Eloipool (the software behind Eligius, EclipseMC, TripleMining, and other pools) has attempted to produce blocks with only transaction counts that are powers of two; such blocks cannot be used for an attack even against vulnerable clients. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   Donate: (PM me)My projects: [Bitcoin Knots](http://bitcoinknots.org/), [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/), [BFGMiner](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=626361), [Eloipool (pool software)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=61731.0), [Tonal Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tonal_Bitcoin), and [BitGit (Bitcoin code directory)](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/) | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |
