Description:
symptom: main.connect fails sporadically with

mysqltest: At line 65: query 'connect  fail_con,localhost,test,zorro,' succeeded - should have failed with errno 1045...

or a similar message.

Reason:  in sql/password.c the function

my_bool
check_scramble(const char *scramble_arg, const char *message,
               const uint8 *hash_stage2)
{
 ...
  return memcmp(hash_stage2, hash_stage2_reassured, SHA1_HASH_SIZE);
}

And in 'man memcmp' one can see
       int memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);
...
       The memcmp() function returns  an  integer  less  than,  equal  to,  or
       greater than zero if the first n bytes of s1 is found, respectively, to
       be less than, to match, or be greater than the first n bytes of s2.

So, memcmp returns an *integer*. It is implicitly casted to my_bool - which is char. If memcmp happen to return a non-zero number that has a zero last byte - check_scramble will return 0 (password was ok), despite the fact that the password was incorrect.

This happens to me (Gentoo, gcc 4.5.3, glibc-2.13) every couple of hundreds logins. Add a loop in connect.test to have a better chance of hitting this bug.

Present in MySQL 5.1 and later, up to the trunk.

Noted in 5.1.63, 5.5.24, 5.5.6 changelogs.

An incorrect type conversion in password handling permitted clients
to connect with incorrect passwords.

RedHat told us they've requested a CVE id for this bug.
It is CVE-2012-2122.

It would be great to avoid duplicate CVE ids for the same issue, if possible, so we all would appreciate if you could use this number and not request a new one.

Just FYI,

we're going to disclose publically the details related to the
security [bug#64884](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=64884).

It's fixed both in MariaDB and in MySQL. And it doesn't affect official
MySQL binaries, as far as I know.

But anyway, here's an advance warning that we'll do it in about a week
or two.

Just to confirm what Sergei wrote earlier, the Oracle-produced MySQL builds do not use the gcc SSE option that exposes this problem.

If you are not using the Oracle builds you should contact your build provider for guidance on how to proceed. If it is needed, it's likely that they will have a recompiled build that includes the code change that eliminates the issue if SSE support is enabled.

Please also remember that in most cases you should have a firewall that prohibits most of the internet and most of an intranet from even being able to send a packet to your MySQL server. If you haven't done this yet, please make it a high priority action item.

If you must have access from the internet, the correct way is usually to use a gateway box that you connect to, which then lets you connect to the server. That way your gateway is the system that can be seen, not your database server. This makes it much harder to cause trouble.

If you haven't done it yet please also read the security section of the MySQL manual: <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/security.html> . It contains many practical steps that you should take to make it harder to cause trouble.

James Day, MySQL Senior Principal Support Engineer, Oracle.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Security vulnerability in MySQL/MariaDB sql/password.c

---

*From*: Sergei Golubchik <serg () montyprogram com>

Hi

We have recently found a serious security bug in MariaDB and MySQL.
So, here, we'd like to let you know about what the issue and its impact
is. At the end you can find a patch, in case you need to patch an older
unsuported MySQL version.

All MariaDB and MySQL versions up to 5.1.61, 5.2.11, 5.3.5, 5.5.22 are
vulnerable.
MariaDB versions from 5.1.62, 5.2.12, 5.3.6, 5.5.23 are not.
MySQL versions from 5.1.63, 5.5.24, 5.6.6 are not.

This issue got assigned an id CVE-2012-2122.

Here's the issue. When a user connects to MariaDB/MySQL, a token (SHA
over a password and a random scramble string) is calculated and compared
with the expected value. Because of incorrect casting, it might've
happened that the token and the expected value were considered equal,
even if the memcmp() returned a non-zero value. In this case
MySQL/MariaDB would think that the password is correct, even while it is
not.  Because the protocol uses random strings, the probability of
hitting this bug is about 1/256.

Which means, if one knows a user name to connect (and "root" almost
always exists), she can connect using *any* password by repeating
connection attempts. ~300 attempts takes only a fraction of second, so
basically account password protection is as good as nonexistent.
Any client will do, there's no need for a special libmysqlclient library.

But practically it's better than it looks - many MySQL/MariaDB builds
are not affected by this bug.

Whether a particular build of MySQL or MariaDB is vulnerable, depends on
how and where it was built. A prerequisite is a memcmp() that can return
an arbitrary integer (outside of -128..127 range). To my knowledge gcc
builtin memcmp is safe, BSD libc memcmp is safe. Linux glibc
sse-optimized memcmp is not safe, but gcc usually uses the inlined
builtin version.

As far as I know, official vendor MySQL and MariaDB binaries are not
vulnerable.

Sergei Golubchik

# CVE-2012-2122: A Tragically Comedic Security Flaw in MySQL

* Jun 11, 2012
* 5 min read
* [HD Moore](/blog/author/hd-moore/)

*Last updated at Sat, 16 Dec 2023 17:27:00 GMT*

## Introduction

On Saturday afternoon Sergei Golubchik posted to the oss-sec mailing list about a recently patched security flaw CVE-2012-2122in the MySQL and MariaDB database servers. This flaw was rooted in an assumption that the memcmp() function would always return a value within the range -128 to 127 (signed character). On some platforms and with certain optimizations enabled, this routine can return values outside of this range, eventually causing the code that compares a hashed password to sometimes return true even when the wrong password is specified. Since the authentication protocol generates a different hash each time this comparison is done, there is a 1 in 256 chance that ANY password would be accepted for authentication.

In short, if you try to authenticate to a MySQL server affected by this flaw, there is a chance it will accept your password even if the wrong one was supplied. The following one-liner in bash will provide access to an affected MySQL server as the root user account, without actually knowing the password.

```
$ for i in `seq 1 1000`; do mysql -u root --password=bad -h 127.0.0.1 2>/dev/null; done
mysql>

```
## Exploitability

Although a wide range of MySQL and MariaDB versions use the vulnerable code, only some of these systems are exploitable. It boils down to whether the memcmp() routine returns values outside of the unsigned character range. According to Sergei, this is normally not the case, and the routine is normally compiled into the server as an inline function. The major exception is when GCC uses SSE optimization. Joshua Drake, a security researcher with Accuvant Labs, provided a sample application that can determine whether your system might be affected. On most systems, the results of this application match the MySQL package provided by the distribution, but the only way to be sure is to actually test it.

So far, the following systems have been confirmed as vulnerable:

* Ubuntu Linux 64-bit ( 10.04, 10.10, 11.04, 11.10, 12.04 )
* OpenSuSE 12.1 64-bit MySQL 5.5.23-log
* Debian Unstable 64-bit 5.5.23-2
* Fedora (confirmed by Red Hat)
* Arch Linux (unspecified version)

Feedback so far indicates the following platforms are NOT vulnerable:

* Official builds from MySQL and MariaDB (including Windows)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 (confirmed by Red Hat)
* CentOS using official RHEL rpms
* Ubuntu Linux 32-bit (10.04, 11.10, 12.04, likely all)
* Debian Linux 6.0.3 64-bit (Version 14.14 Distrib 5.5.18)
* Debian Linux lenny 32-bit 5.0.51a-24 lenny5
* Debian Linux lenny 64-bit 5.0.51a-24 lenny5
* Debian Linux lenny 64-bit 5.1.51-1-log
* Debian Linux squeeze 64-bit 5.1.49-3-log
* Debian Linux squeeze 32-bit 5.1.61-0 squeeze1
* Debian Linux squeeze 64-bit 5.1.61-0 squeeze1
* Gentoo 64-bit 5.1.62-r1
* SuSE 9.3 i586 MySQL 4.1.10a
* OpenIndiana oi\_151a4 5.1.37
* FreeBSD 64-bit (many versions)

Most Linux vendors should have a patch out soon, if not already.

## Caveats and Defense

The first rule of securing MySQL is to not expose to the network at large in the first place. Most Linux distributions bind the MySQL daemon to localhost, preventing remote access to the service. In cases where network access must be provided, MySQL also provides host-based access controls. There are few use cases where the MySQL daemon should be intentionally exposed to the wider network and without any form of host-based access control.

If you are responsible for a MySQL server that is currently exposed to the network unnecessarily, the easiest thing to do is to modify the my.cnf file in order to restrict access to the local system. Open my.cnf with the editor of your choice, find the section labeled mysqld and change (or add a new line to set) the "bind-address" parameter to "127.0.0.1". Restart the MySQL service to apply this setting.

## Real-world Version Information

Pulling from the resources of a personal side project, I was able to derive some statistics about the real-world impact of this vulnerability. This project managed to find and gather the initial handshake for approximately 1.74 million MySQL servers across the internet at large. This statistic only includes MySQL instances that were on hosts publicly exposed to the internet and not bound to localhost.

### Host Access Control

Of the 1.74 million MySQL servers identified, slightly **more than 50%** did not enforce host-based access controls ( 879,046 vs 863,920 ). The data was gathered by scanning randomly generated IPs across the entire addressable IPv4 unicast range, excluding networks known to be "dark" or where the network administrators had opted out of the survey.

### MySQL Version Numbers

If we break down the list of accessible servers by version, we can see that the 5.0.x version series accounts for over 356,000 of the entire set, followed by 285,000 running a 5.1.x version, and 134,436 running a 5.5.x version. Doing the same type of analysis on the build flavor highlights how easy it is to identify Ubuntu (43,900), Debian (6,408), and Windows (98,665) MySQL services from the banners alone. Knowing that most Ubuntu 64-bit builds are likely to be vulnerable, the real question is how many of those nearly 44,000 Ubuntu systems are running 64-bit editions of the operating system.

## Making the Most of It

If you are approaching this issue from the perspective of a penetration tester, this will be one of the most useful MySQL tricks for some time to come. One feature of Metasploit you should be familiar with is the mysql\_hashdump module. This module uses a known username and password to access the master user table of a MySQL server and dump it into a locally-stored "loot" file. This can be easily cracked using a tool like John the Ripper, providing clear-text passwords that may provide further access.

This evening Jonathan Cran (CTO of Pwnie Express) and Metasploit contributor) committed a threaded brute-force module that abuses the authentication bypass flaw to automatically dump the password database. This ensures that even if the authentication bypass vulnerability is fixed, you should still be able to access the database using the cracked password hashes. A quick demonstration of this module is shown below using the latest Metasploit Framework GIT/SVN snapshot.

```

$ msfconsole
msf > use auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_authbypass_hashdump
msf  auxiliary(mysql_authbypass_hashdump) > set USERNAME root
msf  auxiliary(mysql_authbypass_hashdump) > set RHOSTS 127.0.0.1
msf  auxiliary(mysql_authbypass_hashdump) > run

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
