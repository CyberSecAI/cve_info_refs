{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `check_scramble` function in `sql/password.c` incorrectly casts the return value of `memcmp` to `my_bool` (which is a char). This could lead to incorrect password authentication if the integer returned by `memcmp` had a non-zero value but its last byte was zero.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect type conversion",
      "Improper use of memcmp return value"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass password authentication by repeatedly attempting connections with an invalid password until the `memcmp` function returns a value that, when cast to a char, results in 0, thus granting access to the database server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the MySQL server",
      "Repeated connection attempts"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know a valid username, typically 'root', and have network access to the MySQL server."
