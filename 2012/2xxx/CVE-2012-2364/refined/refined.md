Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2364:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An incorrect MIME type was being reported for zipped assignment submissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The server was sending a `text/html` Content-Type header for zipped files instead of `application/x-zip-compressed` (or forcing a download), leading to browsers attempting to render the ZIP archive as HTML.
- This also indicates a more general issue where the software was not correctly using file sending functions, potentially leading to similar issues with other file types.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): By serving the zip file with a `text/html` MIME type, the browser may attempt to interpret the content as HTML, leading to potential XSS if crafted ZIP files contain malicious code.
- The vulnerability could lead to other forms of unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to upload a malicious ZIP archive through a vulnerable feature (e.g., as an assignment submission).
- The attacker's malicious payload would then be triggered when the victim accesses the 'download all' feature and the browser renders the ZIP archive as HTML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to upload files, in this case, assignments to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to know that the victim will use the "download all" feature.
