Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflow in the `phar_parse_tarfile` function of the Phar extension when handling TAR archives.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Integer overflow:  The `phar_parse_tarfile` function does not properly check for integer overflows when processing TAR file headers, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
- Heap-based buffer overflow: The integer overflow vulnerability allows attackers to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, by manipulating values related to file sizes or offsets within the archive.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service (DoS): A successful exploit could lead to an application crash.
- Arbitrary code execution: It is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the affected application.
- Data corruption: The out-of-bounds write could lead to data corruption.

Attack vectors:
- Remote attacker: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted TAR archive file to a PHP application that is using the Phar extension.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to submit/upload a malicious TAR archive file, which is then processed by the vulnerable PHP application, to achieve exploitation.
