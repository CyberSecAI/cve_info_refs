Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2353:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in the access control mechanism for user information within Moodle. Specifically, teachers without the necessary permissions were able to view user access information through the "Settings" -> "Users" -> "Enrolled users" interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Permission Checks:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce access control on user information. The system did not correctly verify if a teacher had the necessary permissions before displaying user access data.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to information disclosure, where unauthorized users (teachers without sufficient permissions) can view sensitive user access details.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to User Data:** The primary impact is that teachers who should not have access to specific user information can view it, potentially including access history or other data intended to be restricted. This can lead to a privacy breach and a loss of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Moodle user interface by navigating to "Settings" -> "Users" -> "Enrolled users".
*   **Role Exploitation:** An attacker would need to be a user with the role of a teacher (or equivalent) within Moodle.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Moodle User:** The attacker must have a teacher role or similar access within a vulnerable Moodle instance.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not require any special administrative or system privileges beyond a standard teacher role.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text explicitly links the fix to commit `ce13ea6ceb15f00c3cc6d40d79b06be39de7987a` in Moodle's git repository.
*   The vulnerability is described as having a "Minor" severity/risk.
*   The affected versions include Moodle 2.2 to 2.2.2+ and 2.1 to 2.1.5+.
