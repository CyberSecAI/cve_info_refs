Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The TYPO3 default exception handler fails to properly encode output, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the exception handler doesn't sanitize user-controlled input before displaying it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can be executed by other users. This can result in:
    - Stealing user session cookies,
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites,
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Third-Party Extensions:** The vulnerability can be exploited if third-party extensions are installed that put user input in exception messages.
- **Extbase MVC Framework:** Extensions using the extbase MVC framework that accept objects in controller actions can also be used to exploit this vulnerability. This is because the objects can be manipulated to introduce malicious code into exception messages, which are then rendered by the vulnerable handler.
- It should be noted that the vulnerability requires a context where user input can end up within an exception message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger an exception where user-controlled input is included in the exception message.
- This can be achieved through interaction with a vulnerable extension.
- No authentication is needed for the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects TYPO3 versions 4.4.0 up to 4.4.14, 4.5.0 up to 4.5.14, 4.6.0 up to 4.6.7 and development releases of the 4.7 branch.
- The fix involves updating to TYPO3 versions 4.4.15, 4.5.15, or 4.6.8 which correctly encode output in the exception handler.
- If a custom exception handler is used, it should also be updated to properly encode output.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Helmut Hummel of the TYPO3 Security Team.
- Debian has issued a security advisory (DSA 2455-1) addressing this issue.
