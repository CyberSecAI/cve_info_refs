      "ID": "CVE-2012-2655",
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way PostgreSQL handles SECURITY DEFINER and SET attributes for a procedural language's call handler. Applying such attributes to a call handler can lead to a server crash.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Incorrect handling of SECURITY DEFINER and SET attributes for procedural language call handlers can lead to a denial of service vulnerability."
       ],
      "Impact": "A database owner can crash the PostgreSQL server by exploiting this vulnerability, causing a denial of service.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Authenticated database owners can exploit this vulnerability."
       ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated database owner to trigger this vulnerability."
