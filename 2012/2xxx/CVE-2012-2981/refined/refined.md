Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-2981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `status/save_mon.cgi` script of Webmin.
*   Specifically, the `type` parameter received from user input is not sanitized before being used in a `do` statement. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code by crafting a `type` value that includes a null byte and a file path, which will be interpreted by Perl's `do` statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The core weakness is the lack of sanitization of the `type` input, allowing an attacker to pass arbitrary data.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The vulnerability leverages how Perl and the underlying C functions handle null bytes. Perl treats null bytes as regular characters while C functions consider them terminators, enabling the attacker to specify a malicious filename in a way that Perl will process but C will not.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the filename passed to `do`, an attacker can force the server to execute arbitrary code from a file of their choosing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary Perl code with the privileges of the Webmin user, typically root.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This can result in complete control of the affected system, allowing the attacker to modify data, install malware, and perform other malicious activities.
*   **Persistence:** The attack can be made persistent because the malicious payload gets saved to disk through the vulnerable `save_mon.cgi` and will be parsed every time `/status/index.cgi` is executed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out via HTTP requests to vulnerable Webmin scripts.
*   **CGI Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `type` parameter in the HTTP request sent to `status/save_mon.cgi` to inject malicious input.
*  **File Save and Subsequent Execution:** The malicious input is stored and then later executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials for Webmin, meaning they must be able to log into the system.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the Webmin server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided patch in the Github commit `ed7365064c189b8f136a9f952062249167d1bd9e` addresses this vulnerability by adding a regular expression check on the `type` parameter. This ensures that it only contains valid characters, preventing code injection.
*   The vulnerability is present in Webmin version 1.580 and potentially earlier versions.
*  The vulnerability can be triggered remotely once the malicious payload is saved to disk via `/status/save_mon.cgi`
*  The vulnerability also exists in `save_mon.cgi`, but directory traversal is required for exploitation.
