Xerox Security Bulletin XRX13-003

FreeFlow Print Server v8
January 2013 Security Patch Cluster (includes Java 6 Update 37 Software)
v1.0
2/26/2013

Background

Oracle delivers quarterly Critical Patch Updates (CPU) to address US-CERT-announced Security vulnerabilities
and deliver reliability improvements to the Solaris Operating System.  Oracle no longer provides these patches
to the general public, but Xerox is authorized to deliver them to Customers with active FreeFlow Print Server
(FFPS) Support contracts (FSMA).  Customers who may have an Oracle Support Contract for their non-FFPS
Solaris  Servers  should  not  install  patches  that  have  not  been  customized  by  Xerox.  Otherwise  the  FFPS
software could be damaged and result in downtime and a lengthy re-installation service call.

This bulletin announces the availability of the following:

Note: Xerox recommends that customers evaluate their security needs periodically and if they need Security
patches  to  address  the  above  CVE  issues,  schedule  an  activity  with  their  Xerox  Service  team  to  install  this
announced Security Patch Cluster.

Applicability

These Security updates are intended for Xerox printer products running one of the FFPS 73.C0.41 or 73.B3.61
SPAR software releases.  This Security patch update has only been tested on these software releases and it is
recommended that they be installed on these FFPS software release versions.  They have not been tested with
the FFPS 73.B0.73 and 73.A3.31 software releases.

The  Xerox  CSE/Analyst  is  provided  a  tool  (accessible  from  CFO  Web  site)  that  enables  them  to  confirm  the
currently  installed  FFPS  software  release,  Security  Patch  Cluster,  and  Java  Software  version.    When  this
Security update has been installed on the FFPS system, this script will output the following:

FFPS Release Version:
FFPS Patch Cluster:
Java Version:

8.0_SP-3 (82.C5.24.86)
January 2013
Java 6 Update 37

Patch Install Methods

The  install  of  these  Security  patches  must  be  performed  by  the  Xerox  Customer  Service  Engineer  (CSE)  or
Analyst.  The customer process to obtain this Security update is to call the Xerox support number to request
the service.

Xerox strives to deliver these critical Security patch updates in a timely manner.  They are available from the
Xerox  Support  organization,  and  can  be  delivered  electronically  over  the  Internet  to  the  FFPS  system  via  a
GUI tool called the FFPS Update Manager. The other method of delivery is an FTP transfer to the FFPS system
or  writing  the  patch  cluster  to  DVD/USB  media.    A  more  detailed  description  of  the  methods  used  by  the
CSE/Analyst to install the Security patches is as follows:

FFPS Update Manager GUI

Once the Security patches are ready for customer delivery they are made available from the Xerox Edge
Host  and  Download  servers.    The  CSE/Analyst  uses  the  Update  Manager  GUI  on  the  FFPS  system  to
download  and  install  the  Security  patches  over  the  Internet.    When  the  Xerox  server  is  checked  for
updates  from  FFPS  Update  Manager,  this  Security  patch  update  is  listed  as  “January  2013  Security
Patch Cluster (FFPS v8)”.

This requires that the FFPS system be configured with the customer proxy information to gain Security
patch  update  access  from  the  Xerox  servers.    The  connection  is  initiated  by  the  FFPS  system  and  the
Xerox  servers  do  not  have  access  to  the  customer  network.    The  Xerox  server  and  FFPS  system  both
authenticate  each  other  before  a  data  transfer  can  be  successfully  established  between  the  two  end
points.

Hard Disk, DVD/USB Media

Once  the  Security  patch  updates  are  ready  for  customer  delivery  they  are  made  available  on  the  CFO
Web site.  The CSE/Analyst can download and prepare for the install by writing the Security patch update
into a well-known directory on the FFPS system, or on DVD/USB media.  The FFPS Security Patch Cluster is
delivered  as  an  ISO  image  and  ZIP  archive  file  to  provide  the  Xerox  Service  Representative  options  to
choose an install method.  Once the patch cluster has been prepared on media an install script can be run
to perform the install.  The install  script accepts an argument that identifies the media that contains a
copy of the FFPS Security Patch Cluster.  (E.g., # installSecPatches.sh [ disk | dvd | usb ]).

Important: The install of this Security patch update can fail if the archive file containing the patches is
corrupted from file transfer or writing to DVD media.  There have been reported install failures when the
archive  file  written  on  DVD  media  was  corrupt.    The  Security  patch  update  could  be  corrupted  when
writing  to  media  by  particular  DVD  burn  applications  writing  on  some  DVD  media  types.    It  is  very
important that the Security patch archive written onto the DVD install media be verified with the original
archive file that was written to DVD.

The Security patch cluster is delivered as a ZIP and an ISO file.  The file size and check sum of these files
on Windows and Solaris are as follows:

Security Patch File

Windows Size (Kb)

Solaris Size (bytes)

Solaris Checksum

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip

1,663,512

1,703,435,583

54151  3327023

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.iso

1,615,862

1,703,794,688

13849  3327724

The Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip listed on the DVD media can be verified by comparing it to
the original archive file size and checksum.  Copy this archive to a location on the FFPS system and type
‘sum  Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip’  from  a  terminal  window.    The  checksum  value  should  be
‘54151    3327023’,  and  this  validates  the  correct  January  2013  Security  Patch  Cluster  is  written  on  the
DVD.

1 Overview

An input validation ﬂaw allows for authenticated users to execute arbitrary Perl statements, commands,
or libraries by parsing any ﬁle provided.

2

Impact

Privileged arbitrary code execution as the root user is achievable by leveraging this vulnerability.

3 Technical Explanation

When user input for the CGI variable “type” is passed into /status/save mon.cgi it is assigned the name
“$serv->{’type’}” and “${type}” in the underlying scripting language, as shown in Code Excerpt 1.

Code Excerpt 1 CGI “type” Variable
if ($in{’type’}) {

$serv->{’type’} = $in{’type’};

Later ${type} is reassigned within statuslib.pl as “${t}” and used within a ﬁlename in a “do” statement
without any validation of the user input, as shown in Code Excerpt 2.

Code Excerpt 2 Unvalidated User Input in “do” Statement
local $t = $_[0]->{’type’};
...
else {

do "${t}-monitor.pl" if (!$done_monitor{$t}++);
local $func = "get_${t}_status";

Perl treats null bytes as regular characters whereas the underlying C functions used by Perl to perform
the opening of ﬁles treat null bytes as terminators. By using a poison null byte it is possible to cause the
underlying C functions to open and read an arbitrary ﬁle. An example of this would be index.cgi reading
the data/ﬁlename (“/tmp/environ”) and additionally passing a null byte at the end of the arbitrary
ﬁlename. The complete ﬁlename as Perl interprets it then becomes “/tmp/environ%00-monitor.pl”.

The underlying C functions interpret the null as a terminator and open “/tmp/environ” instead of
“/tmp/environ%00-monitor.pl”. The data from that ﬁle is then passed into the Perl interpreter and
inserted into a “do” statement.

save mon.cgi causes the arbitrary ﬁlename to be saved into conﬁguration variables under
$webminroot/etc/status/services/<epochtime>.serv, as shown in Code Excerpt 3.

Code Excerpt 3 save mon.cgi Conﬁguration Variables
runon=0
depend=
ontimeout=
remote=\*
email=

clone=
onup=
tmpl=
fails=1
desc=Alive System
groups=
type=/tmp/environ\^@
id=1331832761
notify=snmp sms pager
nosched=0

This ﬁle is then parsed by /status/index.cgi which utilizes the service table method as shown in Code Ex-
erpt 4 to read all service ﬁles from /etc/webmin/status/services and subsequently calls the service status
method within the status-lib.pl
library. The ﬁlename information is parsed and passed into the ser-
vice status method as ${t}. The variable ${t} is passed into a “do” statement within status-lib.pl, as
shown in Code Excerpt 5.

Code Excerpt 4 /status/index.cgi: service table Function

if ($config{’index_status’}) {

@stats = &service_status($s, 1);

Code Excerpt 5 status-lib.pl: service status Function
do "${t}-monitor.pl" if (!$done_monitor{$t}++);

In Perl, “do” can be passed a block or group of statements to be parsed or a subroutine; however, it
may also be passed a ﬁlename. When passed a ﬁlename such as “do ’ﬁlename.pl’ ” the underlying Perl
interpreter treats it as though the ﬁlename had been passed to an eval() method.

Therefore, because the arbitrary data is being assigned to variable “$t” and passed as part of a ﬁlename
within a “do” statement without any input validation it is possible to insert arbitrary data into that
ﬁlename. This allows an attacker to tell the Perl interpreter to open and eval() an arbitrary ﬁle. For
example, when index.cgi parses the “type” variable from the saved conﬁguration ﬁle the “do” statement
may become as shown in Code Excerpt 6. This is equivalent to the statement “eval ’/tmp/environ´’’ and
causes all lines in /tmp/environ to be interpreted and executed by the Perl interpreter.

Code Excerpt 6 index.cgi Example
do "/tmp/environ%00-monitor.pl";

It should be noted that the same vulnerability with variable “$type” exists within save mon.cgi; however,
directory traversal (appending one or more ’../’s) must be utilized to exploit the vulnerability in that
location.

## Webmin contains input validation vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#788478

Original Release Date: 2012-09-06 | Last Revised: 2014-08-15

---

### Overview

Webmin 1.580, and possibly earlier versions, has been reported to contain input validation vulnerabilities.

### Description

| The advisories from American Information Security Group report the following vulnerabilities.  [**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation - CVE-2012-2981***"An input validation flaw allows for authenticated users to execute arbitrary Perl statements, commands, or libraries by parsing any file provided."*[**CWE-77**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)**:** **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command** **- CVE-2012-2982***"An input validation flaw within /file/show.cgi allows for authenticated users to execute arbitrary system commands as a privileged user. Additionally, anyone with a previously established session can be made to execute arbitrary commands on the server by embedding the attack in HTML code–such as IMG SRC tags within HTML emails."*[**CWE-22**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**:** **Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory** **- CVE-2012-2983***"A directory traversal flaw within edit\_html.cgi allows an attacker to view any file as user root."*Full details of each vulnerability are available in the American Information Security Group advisories linked in the References section. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. The vendor is aware of the vulnerabilities and has patches available in the development branch but an official version including the patches was not available at the time of publication. *Patch for CVE-2012-2981*<https://github.com/webmin/webmin/commit/ed7365064c189b8f136a9f952062249167d1bd9e>*Patch for CVE-2012-2982*<https://github.com/webmin/webmin/commit/1f1411fe7404ec3ac03e803cfa7e01515e71a213>*Patch for CVE-2012-2983*<https://github.com/webmin/webmin/commit/4cd7bad70e23e4e19be8ccf7b9f245445b2b3b80>Please consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing Webmin using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
