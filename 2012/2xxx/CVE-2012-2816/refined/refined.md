The provided content relates to CVE-2012-2816.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw that allows sandboxed processes to interfere with each other.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness lies in the insufficient isolation between sandboxed processes, allowing them to potentially interact in unintended ways.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to sandboxed processes interfering with each other.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves an attacker being able to influence or control the execution of multiple sandboxed processes within the same environment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be in a position to control or influence multiple sandboxed processes. This likely means the attacker already has some control of the system where Chrome is running and can cause the execution of multiple sandboxed processes, potentially by visiting specific web pages or running particular extensions. This vulnerability is specific to Windows.
