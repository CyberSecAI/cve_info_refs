Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2330:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the HTTP parser of Node.js versions prior to 0.6.17 and 0.7.8. Specifically, the parser's buffer contents could be appended to the attacker's request header under certain circumstances.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the potential to leak data from the HTTP parser's buffer. Since the server may echo back contents of a request, the appended buffer data may be disclosed to the attacker. This could potentially expose sensitive data from other requests being processed by the server.
*   **Potential Header Spoofing:** While not explicitly demonstrated, the vulnerability theoretically allows for header spoofing attacks. An attacker could manipulate the request headers by injecting arbitrary data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information contained in other requests that were processed by the vulnerable server, which can lead to further attacks.
*   **Header Spoofing:** Theoretically, an attacker could potentially modify or inject headers, although the feasibility of this attack was not demonstrated.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a carefully crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Node.js server. This request triggers the flaw in the HTTP parser, causing the buffer contents to be appended to the attacker's request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Node.js server. There are no specific positional requirements beyond network connectivity to the server.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft an HTTP request that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Node.js versions 0.6.17 and 0.7.8.
*   The fix involves a change in `src/node_http_parser.cc`, specifically addressing how the `StringPtr::Update` method handles non-consecutive inputs.
*   The provided information includes a link to the commit that addresses the issue: [https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/c9a231d](https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/c9a231d).
