Unlike Citrix ICA, no server  extensions are required.  (yes, i stole that blurb from rdesktop's home page ;)  the build depends on X and optionally ssl - i suggest net-misc/rdesktop. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Jo Ryden    2002-01-30 02:17:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 99](attachment.cgi?id=99 "rdesktop-1.1.0.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=99&action=edit "rdesktop-1.1.0.ebuild")] rdesktop-1.1.0.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Donny Davies (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-08 19:24:43 UTC  ``` added.  thanks! for a fairly well written .ebuild :)  note: this doesnt build in the sandbox, ie: no $DESTDIR in the Makefile.. so manually install it.   ``` |  |

# FlightGear, SimGear: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201603-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in FlightGear and SimGear
allowing remote attackers to cause Denial of Service and possibly execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **games-simulation/flightgear** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.4.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.4.0** |

| Package | **games-simulation/simgear** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.4.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.4.0** |

### Background

FlightGear is an open-source flight simulator. It supports a variety of
popular platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and is developed by skilled
volunteers from around the world. Source code for the entire project is
available and licensed under the GNU General Public License.

SimGear is a set of open-source libraries designed to be used as
building blocks for quickly assembling 3d simulations, games, and
visualization applications.

### Description

Multiple format string vulnerabilities in FlightGear and SimGear allow
user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly
execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in certain data chunk
values in an aircraft xml model.

### Impact

Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code or cause Denial
of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Flightgear users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=games-simulation/flightgear-3.4.0"

```

All Simgear users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-simulation/simgear-3.4.0"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
