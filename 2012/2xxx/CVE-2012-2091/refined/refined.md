Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2091:

**CVE-2012-2091** is related to multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in FlightGear and SimGear.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from buffer overflows within the handling of data when processing aircraft XML model files and potentially scene graph model data files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The core issue is the presence of buffer overflows in the software's code, specifically when parsing data from XML files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation of these buffer overflows could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, potentially allowing a remote attacker to take control of the system.
- Denial of Service (DoS):  The vulnerabilities could also result in a crash of the application, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted XML Files: A remote attacker could create a specially crafted XML model file for an aircraft (in the case of FlightGear) or scene graph (in the case of SimGear).
- User Interaction:  The attack requires a local, unsuspecting user to open the malicious XML file within FlightGear or an application linked against SimGear.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Attackers: Attackers can be remote because the attack is based on the user opening a file.
- User Assistance: The attacker requires user interaction where a user must open a crafted XML file.
