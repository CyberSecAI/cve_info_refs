Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-2652:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how QEMU's snapshot mode (-snapshot) handles temporary files. Specifically, a race condition exists in the way these temporary files are created and managed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The primary weakness is the incorrect handling of temporary files when creating snapshots.
- **Race Condition:** A race condition occurs during the creation and use of temporary files. This race condition allows for a symlink attack

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A successful attack could allow a local attacker (potentially a guest user in a virtualized environment) to overwrite arbitrary files with root privileges on the host system.
- **Guest Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can lead to sensitive information from the guest system being disclosed on the host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system running QEMU.
- **Symlink Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited via a symlink attack.
- **Snapshot Mode:** The attack requires QEMU to be running in snapshot mode (-snapshot).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system running QEMU.
- **Guest Access:** In virtualized environments, the attacker could be a user within the guest OS.
- **QEMU Command Execution:** Requires ability to cause qemu to start the snapshot process.
