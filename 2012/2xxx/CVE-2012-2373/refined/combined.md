…condition

When holding the mmap_sem for reading, pmd_offset_map_lock should only
run on a pmd_t that has been read atomically from the pmdp pointer,
otherwise we may read only half of it leading to this crash.

This should be a longstanding bug affecting x86 32bit PAE without THP.
Only archs with 64bit large pmd_t and 32bit unsigned long should be
affected.

With THP enabled the barrier() in pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad()
would partly hide the bug when the pmd transition from none to stable,
by forcing a re-read of the *pmd in pmd_offset_map_lock, but when THP is
enabled a new set of problem arises by the fact could then transition
freely in any of the none, pmd_trans_huge or pmd_trans_stable states.
So making the barrier in pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad()
unconditional isn't good idea and it would be a flakey solution.

This should be fully fixed by introducing a pmd_read_atomic that reads
the pmd in order with THP disabled, or by reading the pmd atomically
with cmpxchg8b with THP enabled.

Luckily this new race condition only triggers in the places that must
already be covered by pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() so the fix
is localized there but this bug is not related to THP.

NOTE: this can trigger on x86 32bit systems with PAE enabled with more
than 4G of ram, otherwise the high part of the pmd will never risk to be
truncated because it would be zero at all times, in turn so hiding the
SMP race.

This bug was discovered and fully debugged by Ulrich, quote:

----
[..]
pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() loads the content of edx and
eax.

    496 static inline int pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad(pmd_t
    *pmd)
    497 {
    498         /* depend on compiler for an atomic pmd read */
    499         pmd_t pmdval = *pmd;

                                // edi = pmd pointer
0xc0507a74 <sys_mincore+548>:   mov    0x8(%esp),%edi
...
                                // edx = PTE page table high address
0xc0507a84 <sys_mincore+564>:   mov    0x4(%edi),%edx
...
                                // eax = PTE page table low address
0xc0507a8e <sys_mincore+574>:   mov    (%edi),%eax

[..]

Please note that the PMD is not read atomically. These are two "mov"
instructions where the high order bits of the PMD entry are fetched
first. Hence, the above machine code is prone to the following race.

-  The PMD entry {high|low} is 0x0000000000000000.
   The "mov" at 0xc0507a84 loads 0x00000000 into edx.

-  A page fault (on another CPU) sneaks in between the two "mov"
   instructions and instantiates the PMD.

-  The PMD entry {high|low} is now 0x00000003fda38067.
   The "mov" at 0xc0507a8e loads 0xfda38067 into eax.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-05-18 04:22:02 UTC  ``` Reported by Li Honggang (internal): Attempting an rds connection from the IP address of an IPoIB interface to itself causes a kernel panic due to a BUG_ON() being triggered.  Making the test less strict allows rds-ping to work without crashing the machine.  A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the sytem.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c4)  Petr Matousek    2012-06-05 18:04:54 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux MRG. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-18 13:35:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0743 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0743.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c6)  Murray McAllister    2012-12-04 03:59:47 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Li Honggang of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 20:53:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1540 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1540.html>   ``` |  |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's macvtap device driver, which is

used in KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) to create a network bridge

between host and guest. A privleged user in a guest could exploit this flaw

to crash the host, if the vhost\_net module is loaded with the

experimental\_zcopytx option enabled. ([CVE-2012-2119](/security/CVE-2012-2119))

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel's network TUN/TAP device

implementation. A local user with access to the TUN/TAP interface (which is

not available to unprivileged users until granted by a root user) could

exploit this flaw to crash the system or potential gain administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2012-2136](/security/CVE-2012-2136))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel-based Virtual

Machine) subsystem handled MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts). A local

unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or

potentially elevate privileges. ([CVE-2012-2137](/security/CVE-2012-2137))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)

protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2372](/security/CVE-2012-2372))

Ulrich Obergfell discovered an error in the Linux kernel's memory

management subsystem on 32 bit PAE systems with more than 4GB of memory

installed. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to crash the

system. ([CVE-2012-2373](/security/CVE-2012-2373))

It was discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the Linux

kernel, was not correctly validating the origin on Netlink messages. An

untrusted local user can cause a denial of service of Linux guests in

Hyper-V virtualization environments. ([CVE-2012-2669](/security/CVE-2012-2669))

Dan Rosenberg discovered flaws in the Linux kernel's NCI (Near Field

Communication Controller Interface). A remote attacker could exploit these

flaws to crash the system or potentially execute privileged code.

([CVE-2012-3364](/security/CVE-2012-3364))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's epoll system call. An

unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.

([CVE-2012-3375](/security/CVE-2012-3375))

Some errors where discovered in the Linux kernel's UDF file system, which

is used to mount some CD-ROMs and DVDs. An unprivileged local user could

use these flaws to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-3400](/security/CVE-2012-3400))

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel's memory

subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a

denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-3511](/security/CVE-2012-3511))

Denys Fedoryshchenko discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel's TCP receive

processing for IPv4. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (kernel resource consumption) via a flood of SYN+FIN TCP

packets. ([CVE-2012-6638](/security/CVE-2012-6638))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-29-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-29.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-29.46)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A local, unprivileged user could use an integer overflow flaw in

drm\_mode\_dirtyfb\_ioctl() to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2012-0044, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the macvtap device driver, used for

creating a bridged network between the guest and the host in KVM
(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) environments. A privileged guest user in a
KVM guest could use this flaw to crash the host. Note: This issue only
affected hosts that have the vhost\_net module loaded with the
experimental\_zcopytx module option enabled (it is not enabled by default),
and that also have macvtap configured for at least one guest.
(CVE-2012-2119, Important)

* When a set user ID (setuid) application is executed, certain personality

flags for controlling the application's behavior are cleared (that is, a
privileged application will not be affected by those flags). It was found
that those flags were not cleared if the application was made privileged
via file system capabilities. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to change the behavior of such applications, allowing them to bypass
intended restrictions. Note that for default installations, no application
shipped by Red Hat for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is made privileged via file
system capabilities. (CVE-2012-2123, Important)

* It was found that the data\_len parameter of the sock\_alloc\_send\_pskb()

function in the Linux kernel's networking implementation was not validated
before use. A privileged guest user in a KVM guest could use this flaw to
crash the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.
(CVE-2012-2136, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the setup\_routing\_entry() function in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel in the way the Message Signaled
Interrupts (MSI) routing entry was handled. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or, possibly, escalate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-2137, Important)

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's memory management

subsystem in the way pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad(), when called with mmap\_sem in
read mode, and Transparent Huge Pages (THP) page faults interacted. A
privileged user in a KVM guest with the ballooning functionality enabled
could potentially use this flaw to crash the host. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-1179, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way device memory was handled during guest device

removal. Upon successful device removal, memory used by the device was not
properly unmapped from the corresponding IOMMU or properly released from
the kernel, leading to a memory leak. A malicious user on a KVM host who
has the ability to assign a device to a guest could use this flaw to crash
the host. (CVE-2012-2121, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)

protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2372, Moderate)

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's memory management

subsystem in the way pmd\_populate() and pte\_offset\_map\_lock() interacted on
32-bit x86 systems with more than 4GB of RAM. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2373, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Chen Haogang for reporting CVE-2012-0044.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

ocfs2: fix NULL pointer dereference in \_\_ocfs2\_change\_file\_space()
commit a4e08d001f2e50bb8b3c4eebadcf08e5535f02ee upstream.
As ocfs2\_fallocate() will invoke \_\_ocfs2\_change\_file\_space() with a NULL
as the first parameter (file), it may trigger a NULL pointer dereferrence
due to a missing check.

memblock: free allocated memblock\_reserved\_regions later
commit 29f6738609e40227dabcc63bfb3b84b3726a75bd upstream.
memblock\_free\_reserved\_regions() calls memblock\_free(), but
memblock\_free() would double reserved.regions too, so we could free the
old range for reserved.regions.
Also tj said there is another bug which could be related to this.
| I don't think we're saving any noticeable
| amount by doing this "free - give it to page allocator - reserve
| again" dancing. We should just allocate regions aligned to page
| boundaries and free them later when memblock is no longer in use.
in that case, when DEBUG\_PAGEALLOC, will get panic:

fs: ramfs: file-nommu: add SetPageUptodate()
commit fea9f718b3d68147f162ed2d870183ce5e0ad8d8 upstream.
There is a bug in the below scenario for !CONFIG\_MMU:
1. create a new file
2. mmap the file and write to it
3. read the file can't get the correct value
Because
sys\_read() -> generic\_file\_aio\_read() -> simple\_readpage() -> clear\_page()
which causes the page to be zeroed.
Add SetPageUptodate() to ramfs\_nommu\_expand\_for\_mapping() so that
generic\_file\_aio\_read() do not call simple\_readpage().

mm, thp: abort compaction if migration page cannot be charged to memcg
commit 4bf2bba3750f10aa9e62e6949bc7e8329990f01b upstream.
If page migration cannot charge the temporary page to the memcg,
migrate\_pages() will return -ENOMEM. This isn't considered in memory
compaction however, and the loop continues to iterate over all
pageblocks trying to isolate and migrate pages. If a small number of
very large memcgs happen to be oom, however, these attempts will mostly
be futile leading to an enormous amout of cpu consumption due to the
page migration failures.
This patch will short circuit and fail memory compaction if
migrate\_pages() returns -ENOMEM. COMPACT\_PARTIAL is returned in case
some migrations were successful so that the page allocator will retry.

memory hotplug: fix invalid memory access caused by stale kswapd pointer
commit d8adde17e5f858427504725218c56aef90e90fc7 upstream.
kswapd\_stop() is called to destroy the kswapd work thread when all memory
of a NUMA node has been offlined. But kswapd\_stop() only terminates the
work thread without resetting NODE\_DATA(nid)->kswapd to NULL. The stale
pointer will prevent kswapd\_run() from creating a new work thread when
adding memory to the memory-less NUMA node again. Eventually the stale
pointer may cause invalid memory access.
An example stack dump as below. It's reproduced with 2.6.32, but latest
kernel has the same issue.

So move the addition of data\_offset to after the call to

drm/i915: rip out the PM\_IIR WARN
commit 58bf8062d0b293b8e1028e5b0342082002886bd4 upstream.
After banging my head against this for the past few months, I still
don't see how this could possible race under the premise that once an
irq bit is masked in PM\_IMR and reset in PM\_IIR it won't show up again
until we unmask it in PM\_IMR.
Still, we have reports of this being seen in the wild. Now Bspec has
this little bit of lovely language in the PMIIR register:
Public SNB Docs, Vol3Part2, 2.5.14 "PMIIR":
"For each bit, the IIR can store a second pending interrupt if two or
more of the same interrupt conditions occur before the first condition
is cleared. Upon clearing the interrupt, the IIR bit will momentarily
go low, then return high to indicate there is another interrupt
pending."
Now if we presume that PMIMR only prevent new interrupts from being
queued, we could easily end up masking an interrupt and clearing it,
but the 2nd pending interrupt setting the bit in PMIIR right away
again. Which leads, the next time the irq handler runs, to hitting the
WARN.
Also, no bad side effects of this have ever been reported. And we've
tracked down our issues with the gpu turbo getting stuck to bogus
interrupt generation limits in th RPLIMIT register.
So let's just rip out this WARN as bogus and call it a day. The only
shallow thing here is that this 2-deep irq queue in the hw makes you
wonder how racy the windows irq handler is ...

splice: fix racy pipe->buffers uses

Dave Jones reported a kernel BUG at mm/slub.c:3474! triggered
by splice\_shrink\_spd() called from vmsplice\_to\_pipe()
commit 35f3d14dbbc5 (pipe: add support for shrinking and growing pipes)
added capability to adjust pipe->buffers.
Problem is some paths don't hold pipe mutex and assume pipe->buffers
doesn't change for their duration.
Fix this by adding nr\_pages\_max field in struct splice\_pipe\_desc, and
use it in place of pipe->buffers where appropriate.
splice\_shrink\_spd() loses its struct pipe\_inode\_info argument.

through nl80211, but will at least correctly advertise supported

macvtap: zerocopy: validate vectors before building skb
commit b92946e2919134ebe2a4083e4302236295ea2a73 upstream.
There're several reasons that the vectors need to be validated:
- Return error when caller provides vectors whose num is greater than UIO\_MAXIOV.
- Linearize part of skb when userspace provides vectors grater than MAX\_SKB\_FRAGS.
- Return error when userspace provides vectors whose total length may exceed
- MAX\_SKB\_FRAGS \* PAGE\_SIZE.

thp: avoid atomic64\_read in pmd\_read\_atomic for 32bit PAE
commit e4eed03fd06578571c01d4f1478c874bb432c815 upstream.
In the x86 32bit PAE CONFIG\_TRANSPARENT\_HUGEPAGE=y case while holding the
mmap\_sem for reading, cmpxchg8b cannot be used to read pmd contents under
Xen.
So instead of dealing only with "consistent" pmdvals in
pmd\_none\_or\_trans\_huge\_or\_clear\_bad() (which would be conceptually
simpler) we let pmd\_none\_or\_trans\_huge\_or\_clear\_bad() deal with pmdvals
where the low 32bit and high 32bit could be inconsistent (to avoid having
to use cmpxchg8b).
The only guarantee we get from pmd\_read\_atomic is that if the low part of
the pmd was found null, the high part will be null too (so the pmd will be
considered unstable). And if the low part of the pmd is found "stable"
later, then it means the whole pmd was read atomically (because after a
pmd is stable, neither MADV\_DONTNEED nor page faults can alter it anymore,
and we read the high part after the low part).
In the 32bit PAE x86 case, it is enough to read the low part of the pmdval
atomically to declare the pmd as "stable" and that's true for THP and no
THP, furthermore in the THP case we also have a barrier() that will
prevent any inconsistent pmdvals to be cached by a later re-read of the
\*pmd.

commit 26c191788f18129af0eb32a358cdaea0c7479626 upstream.
When holding the mmap\_sem for reading, pmd\_offset\_map\_lock should only
run on a pmd\_t that has been read atomically from the pmdp pointer,
otherwise we may read only half of it leading to this crash.

This should be a longstanding bug affecting x86 32bit PAE without THP.
Only archs with 64bit large pmd\_t and 32bit unsigned long should be
affected.
With THP enabled the barrier() in pmd\_none\_or\_trans\_huge\_or\_clear\_bad()
would partly hide the bug when the pmd transition from none to stable,
by forcing a re-read of the \*pmd in pmd\_offset\_map\_lock, but when THP is
enabled a new set of problem arises by the fact could then transition
freely in any of the none, pmd\_trans\_huge or pmd\_trans\_stable states.
So making the barrier in pmd\_none\_or\_trans\_huge\_or\_clear\_bad()
unconditional isn't good idea and it would be a flakey solution.
This should be fully fixed by introducing a pmd\_read\_atomic that reads
the pmd in order with THP disabled, or by reading the pmd atomically
with cmpxchg8b with THP enabled.
Luckily this new race condition only triggers in the places that must
already be covered by pmd\_none\_or\_trans\_huge\_or\_clear\_bad() so the fix
is localized there but this bug is not related to THP.
NOTE: this can trigger on x86 32bit systems with PAE enabled with more
than 4G of ram, otherwise the high part of the pmd will never risk to be
truncated because it would be zero at all times, in turn so hiding the
SMP race.
This bug was discovered and fully debugged by Ulrich, quote:

Please note that the PMD is not read atomically. These are two "mov"
instructions where the high order bits of the PMD entry are fetched
first. Hence, the above machine code is prone to the following race.
- The PMD entry {high|low} is 0x0000000000000000.
The "mov" at 0xc0507a84 loads 0x00000000 into edx.
- A page fault (on another CPU) sneaks in between the two "mov"
instructions and instantiates the PMD.
- The PMD entry {high|low} is now 0x00000003fda38067.
The "mov" at 0xc0507a8e loads 0xfda38067 into eax.

the two bits have relationship. A delayed stripe can be moved to hold list only
when preread active stripe count is below IO\_THRESHOLD. If a stripe has both

PCI: EHCI: fix crash during suspend on ASUS computers
commit dbf0e4c7257f8d684ec1a3c919853464293de66e upstream.
Quite a few ASUS computers experience a nasty problem, related to the
EHCI controllers, when going into system suspend. It was observed
that the problem didn't occur if the controllers were not put into the
D3 power state before starting the suspend, and commit
151b61284776be2d6f02d48c23c3625678960b97 (USB: EHCI: fix crash during
suspend on ASUS computers) was created to do this.
It turned out this approach messed up other computers that didn't have
the problem -- it prevented USB wakeup from working. Consequently
commit c2fb8a3fa25513de8fedb38509b1f15a5bbee47b (USB: add
NO\_D3\_DURING\_SLEEP flag and revert 151b61284776be2) was merged; it
reverted the earlier commit and added a whitelist of known good board
names.
Now we know the actual cause of the problem. Thanks to AceLan Kao for
tracking it down.
According to him, an engineer at ASUS explained that some of their
BIOSes contain a bug that was added in an attempt to work around a
problem in early versions of Windows. When the computer goes into S3
suspend, the BIOS tries to verify that the EHCI controllers were first
quiesced by the OS. Nothing's wrong with this, but the BIOS does it
by checking that the PCI COMMAND registers contain 0 without checking
the controllers' power state. If the register isn't 0, the BIOS
assumes the controller needs to be quiesced and tries to do so. This
involves making various MMIO accesses to the controller, which don't
work very well if the controller is already in D3. The end result is
a system hang or memory corruption.
Since the value in the PCI COMMAND register doesn't matter once the
controller has been suspended, and since the value will be restored
anyway when the controller is resumed, we can work around the BIOS bug
simply by setting the register to 0 during system suspend. This patch
(as1590) does so and also reverts the second commit mentioned above,
which is now unnecessary.
In theory we could do this for every PCI device. However to avoid
introducing new problems, the patch restricts itself to EHCI host
controllers.
Finally the affected systems can suspend with USB wakeup working
properly.

commit b62d32b9166b085a487916eca514b59b5ffdf2b7

xhci: Fix hang on back-to-back Set TR Deq Ptr commands.
commit 0d9f78a92ef5e97d9fe51d9215ebe22f6f0d289d upstream.
The Microsoft LifeChat 3000 USB headset was causing a very reproducible
hang whenever it was plugged in. At first, I thought the host
controller was producing bad transfer events, because the log was filled
with errors like:
xhci\_hcd 0000:00:14.0: ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD
However, it turned out to be an xHCI driver bug in the ring expansion
patches. The bug is triggered When there are two ring segments, and a
TD that ends just before a link TRB, like so:
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
| | ---> | setup TRB B |
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
| | | | data TRB B |
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
| setup TRB A | <-- deq | | data TRB B |
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
| data TRB A | | | | <-- enq, deq''
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
| status TRB A | | | |
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
| link TRB |--------------- | link TRB |
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ <--- deq' \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
TD A (the first control transfer) stalls on the data phase. That halts
the ring. The xHCI driver moves the hardware dequeue pointer to the
first TRB after the stalled transfer, which happens to be the link TRB.
Once the Set TR dequeue pointer command completes, the function
update\_ring\_for\_set\_deq\_completion runs. That function is supposed to
update the xHCI driver's dequeue pointer to match the internal hardware
dequeue pointer. On the first call this would work fine, and the
software dequeue pointer would move to deq'.
However, if the transfer immediately after that stalled (TD B in this
case), another Set TR Dequeue command would be issued. That would move
the hardware dequeue pointer to deq''. Once that command completed,
update\_ring\_for\_set\_deq\_completion would run again.
The original code would unconditionally increment the software dequeue
pointer, which moved the pointer off the ring segment into la-la-land.
The while loop would happy increment the dequeue pointer (possibly
wrapping it) until it matched the hardware pointer value.
The while loop would also access all the memory in between the first
ring segment and the second ring segment to determine if it was a link
TRB. This could cause general protection faults, although it was
unlikely because the ring segments came from a DMA pool, and would often
have consecutive memory addresses.
If nothing in that space looked like a link TRB, the deq\_seg pointer for
the ring would remain on the first segment. Thus, the deq\_seg and the
software dequeue pointer would get out of sync.
When the next transfer event came in after the stalled transfer, the
xHCI driver code would attempt to convert the software dequeue pointer
into a DMA address in order to compare the DMA address for the completed
transfer. Since the deq\_seg and the dequeue pointer were out of sync,
xhci\_trb\_virt\_to\_dma would return NULL.
The transfer event would get ignored, the transfer would eventually
timeout, and we would mistakenly convert the finished transfer to no-op
TRBs. Some kernel driver (maybe xHCI?) would then get stuck in an
infinite loop in interrupt context, and the whole machine would hang.
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.4, that contain
the commit b008df60c6369ba0290fa7daa177375407a12e07 "xHCI: count free
TRBs on transfer ring"

usb: Add support for root hub port status CAS
commit 8bea2bd37df08aaa599aa361a9f8b836ba98e554 upstream.
The host controller port status register supports CAS (Cold Attach
Status) bit. This bit could be set when USB3.0 device is connected
when system is in Sx state. When the system wakes to S0 this port
status with CAS bit is reported and this port can't be used by any
device.
When CAS bit is set the port should be reset by warm reset. This
was not supported by xhci driver.
The issue was found when pendrive was connected to suspended
platform. The link state of "Compliance Mode" was reported together
with CAS bit. This link state was also not supported by xhci and
core/hub.c.
The CAS bit is defined only for xhci root hub port and it is
not supported on regular hubs. The link status is used to force
warm reset on port. Make the USB core issue a warm reset when port
is in ether the 'inactive' or 'compliance mode'. Change the xHCI driver
to report 'compliance mode' when the CAS is set. This force warm reset
on the root hub port.
This patch should be backported to stable kernels as old as 3.2, that
contain the commit 10d674a82e553cb8a1f41027bb3c3e309b3f6804 "USB: When
hot reset for USB3 fails, try warm reset."

The WDM\_READ flag is normally cleared by wdm\_int\_callback
before resubmitting the read urb, and set by wdm\_in\_callback
when this urb returns with data or an error. But a crashing
device may cause both a read error and cancelling all urbs.
Make sure that the flag is cleared by wdm\_read if the buffer
is empty.
We don't clear the flag on errors, as there may be pending
data in the buffer which should be processed. The flag will
instead be cleared on the next wdm\_read call.

SCSI: libsas: fix taskfile corruption in sas\_ata\_qc\_fill\_rtf
commit 6ef1b512f4e6f936d89aa20be3d97a7ec7c290ac upstream.
fill\_result\_tf() grabs the taskfile flags from the originating qc which
sas\_ata\_qc\_fill\_rtf() promptly overwrites. The presence of an
ata\_taskfile in the sata\_device makes it tempting to just copy the full
contents in sas\_ata\_qc\_fill\_rtf(). However, libata really only wants
the fis contents and expects the other portions of the taskfile to not
be touched by ->qc\_fill\_rtf. To that end store a fis buffer in the
sata\_device and use ata\_tf\_from\_fis() like every other ->qc\_fill\_rtf()
implementation.

ACPI / PM: Make acpi\_pm\_device\_sleep\_state() follow the specification
commit dbe9a2edd17d843d80faf2b99f20a691c1853418 upstream.
The comparison between the system sleep state being entered
and the lowest system sleep state the given device may wake up
from in acpi\_pm\_device\_sleep\_state() is reversed, because the
specification (ACPI 5.0) says that for wakeup to work:
"The sleeping state being entered must be less than or equal to the
power state declared in element 1 of the \_PRW object."
In other words, the state returned by \_PRW is the deepest
(lowest-power) system sleep state the device is capable of waking up
the system from.
Moreover, acpi\_pm\_device\_sleep\_state() also should check if the
wakeup capability is supported through ACPI, because in principle it
may be done via native PCIe PME, for example, in which case \_SxW
should not be evaluated.

robust as we don't rely on hi->input->absbit, but on our own structure.
This also prepares hid-multitouch to better support Win8 devices.

OMAPDSS: use DSI\_FIFO\_BUG workaround only for manual update displays
commit 3568f2a46f2a73bab18c914df06afd98a97e0e0e upstream.
There is a problem related to DSS FIFO thresholds and power management
on OMAP3. It seems that when the full PM hits in, we get underflows. The
core reason is unknown, but after experiments it looks like only
particular FIFO thresholds work correctly.
This bug is related to an earlier patch, which added special FIFO
threshold configuration for OMAP3, because DSI command mode output
didn't work with the normal threshold configuration.
However, as the above work-around worked fine for other output types
also, we currently always configure thresholds in this special way on
OMAP3. In theory there should be negligible difference with this special
way and the standard way. The first paragraph explains what happens in
practice.
This patch changes the driver to use the special threshold configuration
only when the output is a manual update display on OMAP3. This does
include RFBI displays also, and although it hasn't been tested (no
boards using RFBI) I suspect the similar behaviour is present there
also, as the DISPC side should work similarly for DSI command mode and
RFBI.

mm/memblock: fix overlapping allocation when doubling reserved array
commit 48c3b583bbddad2220ca4c22319ca5d1f78b2090 upstream.
\_\_alloc\_memory\_core\_early() asks memblock for a range of memory then try
to reserve it. If the reserved region array lacks space for the new
range, memblock\_double\_array() is called to allocate more space for the
array. If memblock is used to allocate memory for the new array it can
end up using a range that overlaps with the range originally allocated in
\_\_alloc\_memory\_core\_early(), leading to possible data corruption.
With this patch memblock\_double\_array() now calls memblock\_find\_in\_range()
with a narrowed candidate range (in cases where the reserved.regions array
is being doubled) so any memory allocated will not overlap with the
original range that was being reserved. The range is narrowed by passing
in the starting address and size of the previously allocated range. Then
the range above the ending address is searched and if a candidate is not
found, the range below the starting address is searched.

mm/memblock: fix memory leak on extending regions
commit 181eb39425f2b9275afcb015eaa547d11f71a02f upstream.
The overall memblock has been organized into the memory regions and
reserved regions. Initially, the memory regions and reserved regions are
stored in the predetermined arrays of "struct memblock \_region". It's
possible for the arrays to be enlarged when we have newly added regions,
but no free space left there. The policy here is to create double-sized
array either by slab allocator or memblock allocator. Unfortunately, we
didn't free the old array, which might be allocated through slab allocator
before. That would cause memory leak.
The patch introduces 2 variables to trace where (slab or memblock) the
memory and reserved regions come from. The memory for the memory or
reserved regions will be deallocated by kfree() if that was allocated by
slab allocator. Thus to fix the memory leak issue.

mm/memblock: cleanup on duplicate VA/PA conversion
commit 4e2f07750d9a94e8f23e86408df5ab95be88bf11 upstream.
The overall memblock has been organized into the memory regions and
reserved regions. Initially, the memory regions and reserved regions are
stored in the predetermined arrays of "struct memblock \_region". It's
possible for the arrays to be enlarged when we have newly added regions
for them, but no enough space there. Under the situation, We will created
double-sized array to meet the requirement. However, the original
implementation converted the VA (Virtual Address) of the newly allocated
array of regions to PA (Physical Address), then translate back when we
allocates the new array from slab. That's actually unnecessary.
The patch removes the duplicate VA/PA conversion.

eCryptfs: Properly check for O\_RDONLY flag before doing privileged open
commit 9fe79d7600497ed8a95c3981cbe5b73ab98222f0 upstream.
If the first attempt at opening the lower file read/write fails,
eCryptfs will retry using a privileged kthread. However, the privileged
retry should not happen if the lower file's inode is read-only because a
read/write open will still be unsuccessful.
The check for determining if the open should be retried was intended to
be based on the access mode of the lower file's open flags being
O\_RDONLY, but the check was incorrectly performed. This would cause the
open to be retried by the privileged kthread, resulting in a second
failed open of the lower file. This patch corrects the check to
determine if the open request should be handled by the privileged
kthread.

eCryptfs: Gracefully refuse miscdev file ops on inherited/passed files
commit 8dc6780587c99286c0d3de747a2946a76989414a upstream.
File operations on /dev/ecryptfs would BUG() when the operations were
performed by processes other than the process that originally opened the
file. This could happen with open files inherited after fork() or file
descriptors passed through IPC mechanisms. Rather than calling BUG(), an
error code can be safely returned in most situations.
In ecryptfs\_miscdev\_release(), eCryptfs still needs to handle the
release even if the last file reference is being held by a process that
didn't originally open the file. ecryptfs\_find\_daemon\_by\_euid() will not
be successful, so a pointer to the daemon is stored in the file's
private\_data. The private\_data pointer is initialized when the miscdev
file is opened and only used when the file is released.

commit fc448a18ae6219af9a73257b1fbcd009efab4a81 upstream.
If a RAID10 has an odd number of chunks - as might happen when there
are an odd number of devices - the last chunk has no pair and so is
not mirrored. We don't store data there, but when recovering the last
device in an array we retry to recover that last chunk from a
non-existent location. This results in an error, and the recovery
aborts.
When we get to that last chunk we should just stop - there is nothing
more to do anyway.
This bug has been present since the introduction of RAID10, so the
patch is appropriate for any -stable kernel.

e1000e: remove use of IP payload checksum
commit 2e1706f234f86ff71056ef69683d734fbf7e9e40 upstream.
Currently only used when packet split mode is enabled with jumbo frames,
IP payload checksum (for fragmented UDP packets) is mutually exclusive with
receive hashing offload since the hardware uses the same space in the
receive descriptor for the hardware-provided packet checksum and the RSS
hash, respectively. Users currently must disable jumbos when receive
hashing offload is enabled, or vice versa, because of this incompatibility.
Since testing has shown that IP payload checksum does not provide any real
benefit, just remove it so that there is no longer a choice between jumbos
or receive hashing offload but not both as done in other Intel GbE drivers
(e.g. e1000, igb).
Also, add a missing check for IP checksum error reported by the hardware;
let the stack verify the checksum when this happens.

iwlwifi: fix activating inactive stations
commit eac9ac6d1f5d0e9d33e4ded682187b630e7606cd upstream.
When authentication/association timed out, the driver would
complain bitterly, printing the message
ACTIVATE a non DRIVER active station id ... addr ...
The cause turns out to be that when the AP station is added
but we don't associate, the IWL\_STA\_UCODE\_INPROGRESS is set
but never cleared. This then causes iwl\_restore\_stations()
to attempt to resend it because it uses the flag internally
and uploads even if it didn't set it itself.
To fix this issue and not upload the station again when it
has already been removed by mac80211, clear the flag after
adding it in case we add it only for association.

Ocfs2 uses kiocb.\*private as a flag of unsigned long size. In

\*private is not initialized in init\_sync\_kiocb() of do\_sync\_write(),
this unaligned io flag may be unexpectly set in an aligned dio.
And this will cause OCFS2\_I(inode)->ip\_unaligned\_aio decreased

will hang forever at ocfs2\_aiodio\_wait() in ocfs2\_file\_aio\_write().

mwifiex: fix WPS eapol handshake failure
commit f03ba7e9a24e5e9efaad56bd1713b994ea556b16 upstream.
After association, STA will go through eapol handshake with WPS
enabled AP. It's observed that WPS handshake fails with some 11n
AP. The reason for the failure is that the eapol packet is sent
via 11n frame aggregation.
The eapol packet should be sent directly without 11n aggregation.
This patch fixes the problem by adding WPS session control while

mwifiex: fix 11n rx packet drop issue
commit 925839243dc9aa4ef25305f5afd10ed18258a4ac upstream.
Currently we check the sequence number of last packet received
against start\_win. If a sequence hole is detected, start\_win is
updated to next sequence number.
Since the rx sequence number is initialized to 0, a corner case
exists when BA setup happens immediately after association. As
0 is a valid sequence number, start\_win gets increased to 1
incorrectly. This causes the first packet with sequence number 0
being dropped.
Initialize rx sequence number as 0xffff and skip adjusting
start\_win if the sequence number remains 0xffff. The sequence
number will be updated once the first packet is received.

mac80211: correct behaviour on unrecognised action frames
commit 4b5ebccc40843104d980f0714bc86bfcd5568941 upstream.
When receiving an "individually addressed" action frame, the
receiver is required to return it to the sender. mac80211
gets this wrong as it also returns group addressed (mcast)
frames to the sender. Fix this and update the reference to
the new 802.11 standards version since things were shuffled
around significantly.

mac80211: clear ifmgd->bssid only after building DELBA
commit 88a9e31c506c00c8b7a2f1611406d0e38dcb33b3 upstream.
ieee80211\_set\_disassoc() clears ifmgd->bssid before
building DELBA frames, resulting in frames with invalid
bssid ("00:00:00:00:00:00").
Fix it by clearing ifmgd->bssid only after building
all the needed frames.
After this change, we no longer need to save the
bssid (before clearing it), so remove the local array.

commit 4ad33411308596f2f918603509729922a1ec4411 upstream.
It makes sense to label "Digital Thermal Sensor" as "DTS", but
unfortunately the string "dts" was already used for "Debug Store", and
/proc/cpuinfo is a user space ABI.
Therefore, rename this to "dtherm".
This conflict went into mainline via the hwmon tree without any x86
maintainer ack, and without any kind of hint in the subject.

commit e734568b675c985db2026848fefaac01c22977a5 upstream.
The OProfile perf backend uses a static array to keep track of the
perf events on the system. When compiling with CONFIG\_CPUMASK\_OFFSTACK=y
&& SMP, nr\_cpumask\_bits is not a compile-time constant and the build
will fail with:
oprofile\_perf.c:28: error: variably modified 'perf\_events' at file scope
This patch uses NR\_CPUs instead of nr\_cpumask\_bits for the array
initialisation. If this causes space problems in the future, we can
always move to dynamic allocation for the events array.

net: qmi\_wwan: fix Oops while disconnecting
commit d9b8706843a501034d09bea63ca6723a2ed02b11 upstream.
usbnet\_disconnect() will set intfdata to NULL before calling
the minidriver unbind function. The cdc\_wdm subdriver cannot
know that it is disconnecting until the qmi\_wwan unbind
function has called its disconnect function. This means that
we must be able to support the cdc\_wdm subdriver operating
normally while usbnet\_disconnect() is running, and in
particular that intfdata may be NULL.
The only place this matters is in qmi\_wwan\_cdc\_wdm\_manage\_power
which is called from cdc\_wdm. Simply testing for NULL
intfdata there is sufficient to allow it to continue working
at all times.
Fixes this Oops where a cdc-wdm device was closed while the
USB device was disconnecting, causing wdm\_release to call
qmi\_wwan\_cdc\_wdm\_manage\_power after intfdata was set to
NULL by usbnet\_disconnect:

net: qmi\_wwan: fix Gobi device probing
commit b9f90eb2740203ff2592efe640409ad48335d1c2 upstream.
Ignoring interfaces with additional descriptors is not a reliable
method for locating the correct interface on Gobi devices. There
is at least one device where this method fails:
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=143506
The result is that the AT command port (interface #2) is hidden
from qcserial, preventing traditional serial modem usage:

[ 15.570372] qcserial 4-1.6:1.3: Qualcomm USB modem converter detected
[ 15.570430] usb 4-1.6: Qualcomm USB modem converter now attached to ttyUSB1
Use static interface numbers taken from the interface map in
qcserial for all Gobi devices instead:
Gobi 1K USB layout:
0: serial port (doesn't respond)
1: serial port (doesn't respond)
2: AT-capable modem port
3: QMI/net
Gobi 2K+ USB layout:
0: QMI/net
1: DM/DIAG (use libqcdm from ModemManager for communication)
2: AT-capable modem port
3: NMEA
This should be more reliable over all, and will also prevent the
noisy "probe failed" messages. The whitelisting logic is expected
to be replaced by direct interface number matching in 3.6.

commit 00001880cd8faaa349fe2ebb158f7e0cd8026048 upstream.
Change the forced interface 4 whitelist to use the generic shared
binder instead of the Gobi specific one. Certain ZTE devices
(K3520-Z & K3765-Z) don't work with the Gobi version, but function
quite happily with the generic. This has been tested with the following
devices:
K3520-Z
K3565-Z
K3765-Z
K4505-Z
It hasn't been tested with the ZTE MF820D, which is the only other
device that uses this whitelist at present. Although Bjorn doesn't
expect any problems, any testing with that device would be appreciated.

ixgbe: Do not pad FCoE frames as this can cause issues with FCoE DDP
commit 57efd44c8cad440fb00ef8078cb018ab2f221373 upstream.
FCoE target mode was experiencing issues due to the fact that we were
sending up data frames that were padded to 60 bytes after the DDP logic had
already stripped the frame down to 52 or 56 depending on the use of VLANs.
This was resulting in the FCoE DDP logic having issues since it thought the
frame still had data in it due to the padding.
To resolve this, adding code so that we do not pad FCoE frames prior to
handling them to the stack.

commit 2c995ff892313009e336ecc8ec3411022f5b1c39 upstream.
skb\_linearize(skb) possibly rearranges the skb internal data and then changes
the skb->data pointer value. For this reason any other pointer in the code that
was assigned skb->data before invoking skb\_linearise(skb) must be re-assigned.
In the current tt\_query message handling code this is not done and therefore, in
case of skb linearization, the pointer used to handle the packet header ends up
in pointing to free'd memory.

SCSI & usb-storage: add try\_rc\_10\_first flag
commit 6a0bdffa0073857870a4ed1b4489762146359eb4 upstream.
Several bug reports have been received recently for USB mass-storage
devices that don't handle READ CAPACITY(16) commands properly. They
report bogus sizes, in some cases becoming unusable as a result.
The bugs were triggered by commit
09b6b51b0b6c1b9bb61815baf205e4d74c89ff04 (SCSI & usb-storage: add
flags for VPD pages and REPORT LUNS), which caused usb-storage to stop
overriding the SCSI level reported by devices. By default, the sd
driver will try READ CAPACITY(16) first for any device whose level is
above SCSI\_SPC\_2.
It seems likely that any device large enough to require the use of
READ CAPACITY(16) (i.e., 2 TB or more) would be able to handle READ
CAPACITY(10) commands properly. Indeed, I don't know of any devices
that don't handle READ CAPACITY(10) properly.
Therefore this patch (as1559) adds a new flag telling the sd driver
to try READ CAPACITY(10) before READ CAPACITY(16), and sets this flag
for every USB mass-storage device. If a device really is larger than
2 TB, sd will fall back to READ CAPACITY(16) just as it used to.
This fixes Bugzilla #43391.

clk: Allow late cache allocation for clk->parents
commit 7975059db572eb47f0fb272a62afeae272a4b209 upstream.
Parent clocks for muxes are cached in clk->parents to
avoid frequent lookups, however the cache allocation happens
only during clock registeration and later clk\_set\_parent()
assumes a cache space available and allocated.
This is not entirely true for platforms which do early clock
registerations wherein the cache allocation using kzalloc
could fail during clock registeration.
Allow cache allocation to happen later as part of clk\_set\_parent()
to help such cases and avoid crashes assuming a cache being
available.
While here also replace existing kmalloc() with kzalloc()
in the file.

stable: Allow merging of backports for serious user-visible performance issues
commit eb3979f64d25120d60b9e761a4c58f70b1a02f86 upstream.
Distribution kernel maintainers routinely backport fixes for users that
were deemed important but not "something critical" as defined by the
rules. To users of these kernels they are very serious and failing to fix
them reduces the value of -stable.
The problem is that the patches fixing these issues are often subtle and
prone to regressions in other ways and need greater care and attention.
To combat this, these "serious" backports should have a higher barrier
to entry.
This patch relaxes the rules to allow a distribution maintainer to merge
to -stable a backported patch or small series that fixes a "serious"
user-visible performance issue. They should include additional information on
the user-visible bug affected and a link to the bugzilla entry if available.
The same rules about the patch being already in mainline still apply.

xen/blkback: Copy id field when doing BLKIF\_DISCARD.
commit 8c9ce606a60e4a0cb447bdc082ce383b96b227b4 upstream.
We weren't copying the id field so when we sent the response
back to the frontend (especially with a 64-bit host and 32-bit
guest), we ended up using a random value. This lead to the
frontend crashing as it would try to pass to \_\_blk\_end\_request\_all
a NULL 'struct request' (b/c it would use the 'id' to find the
proper 'struct request' in its shadow array) and end up crashing:
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 000000e4

ACPI, APEI, Avoid too much error reporting in runtime
commit 34ddeb035d704eafdcdb3cbc781894300136c3c4 upstream.
This patch fixed the following bug.
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=43282
This is caused by a firmware bug checking (checking generic address
register provided by firmware) in runtime. The checking should be
done in address mapping time instead of runtime to avoid too much
error reporting in runtime.

acpi\_pad: fix power\_saving thread deadlock
commit 5f1601261050251a5ca293378b492a69d590dacb upstream.
The acpi\_pad driver can get stuck in destroy\_power\_saving\_task()
waiting for kthread\_stop() to stop a power\_saving thread. The problem
is that the isolated\_cpus\_lock mutex is owned when
destroy\_power\_saving\_task() calls kthread\_stop(), which waits for a
power\_saving thread to end, and the power\_saving thread tries to
acquire the isolated\_cpus\_lock when it calls round\_robin\_cpu(). This
patch fixes the issue by making round\_robin\_cpu() use its own mutex.

drm/radeon: fix VM page table setup on SI
commit c21b328ea8c7c71cd2daf50557db440bbaa7ef55 upstream.
Cayman and trinity allow for variable sized VM page
tables, but SI requires that all page tables be the
same size. The current code assumes variablely sized
VM page tables so SI may end up with part of each page
table overlapping with other memory which could end
up being interpreted by the VM hw as garbage.
Change the code to better accomodate SI. Allocate enough
space for at least 2 full page tables and always set
last\_pfn to max\_pfn on SI so each VM is backed by a full
page table. This limits us to only 2 VMs active at any
given time on SI. This will be rectified and the code can
be reunified once we move to two level page tables.

drm/nouveau/fbcon: using nv\_two\_heads is not a good idea
commit 9bd0c15fcfb42f6245447c53347d65ad9e72080b upstream.
nv\_two\_heads() was never meant to be used outside of pre-nv50 code. The
code checks for >= NV\_10 for 2 CRTCs, then downgrades a few specific
chipsets to 1 CRTC based on (pci\_device & 0x0ff0).
The breakage example seen is on GTX 560Ti, with a pciid of 0x1200, which
gets detected as an NV20 (0x020x) with 1 CRTC by nv\_two\_heads(), causing
memory corruption because there's actually 2 CRTCs..
This switches fbcon to use the CRTC count directly from the mode\_config
structure, which will also fix the same issue on Kepler boards which have
4 CRTCs.

ASoC: tlv320aic3x: Fix codec pll configure bug
commit c9fe573a6584034670c1a55ee8162d623519cbbf upstream.
In sound/soc/codecs/tlv320aic3x.c
data = snd\_soc\_read(codec, AIC3X\_PLL\_PROGA\_REG);
snd\_soc\_write(codec, AIC3X\_PLL\_PROGA\_REG,
data | (pll\_p << PLLP\_SHIFT));
In the above code, pll-p value is OR'ed with previous value without
clearing it. Bug is not seen if pll-p value doesn't change across
Sampling frequency.
However on some platforms (like AM335x EVM-SK), pll-p may have different
values across different sampling frequencies. In such case, above code
configures the pll with a wrong value.
Because of this bug, when a audio stream is played with pll value
different from previous stream, audio is heard as differently(like its
stretched).

ath9k: Fix a WARNING on suspend/resume with IBSS
commit 2031b4c2b4904f7448ab9e4bc6b9bf16e32709f5 upstream.
this patch is dependent on the patch "cfg80211: fix interface
combinations"
In ath9k currently we have ADHOC interface as a single incompatible
interface. when drv\_add\_interface is called during resume we got to
consider number of vifs already present in addition to checking the
drivers 'opmode' information about ADHOC. we incorrectly assume
an ADHOC interface is already present. Then we may miss some driver
specific data for the ADHOC interface after resume.
The above mentioned checks can be removed from the driver,
as the patch 'cfg80211: fix interface combinations' ensures that
if an interface type is not advertised by the driver in any of the
interface combinations(via ieee80211\_iface\_combination) then it shall
be treated as a single incompatible interface. Fixes the following
warning on suspend/resume with ibss interface.

interfaces already exist.

cifs: when server doesn't set CAP\_LARGE\_READ\_X, cap default rsize at MaxBufferSize
commit ec01d738a1691dfc85b96b9f796020267a7be577 upstream.
When the server doesn't advertise CAP\_LARGE\_READ\_X, then MS-CIFS states
that you must cap the size of the read at the client's MaxBufferSize.
Unfortunately, testing with many older servers shows that they often
can't service a read larger than their own MaxBufferSize.
Since we can't assume what the server will do in this situation, we must
be conservative here for the default. When the server can't do large
reads, then assume that it can't satisfy any read larger than its
MaxBufferSize either.
Luckily almost all modern servers can do large reads, so this won't
affect them. This is really just for older win9x and OS/2 era servers.
Also, note that this patch just governs the default rsize. The admin can
always override this if he so chooses.

cifs: fix parsing of password mount option
commit e73f843a3235a19de38359c91586e9eadef12238 upstream.
The double delimiter check that allows a comma in the password parsing code is
unconditional. We set "tmp\_end" to the end of the string and we continue to
check for double delimiter. In the case where the password doesn't contain a
comma we end up setting tmp\_end to NULL and eventually setting "options" to
"end". This results in the premature termination of the options string and hence
the values of UNCip and UNC are being set to NULL. This results in mount failure
with "Connecting to DFS root not implemented yet" error.
This error is usually not noticable as we have password as the last option in
the superblock mountdata. But when we call expand\_dfs\_referral() from
cifs\_mount() and try to compose mount options for the submount, the resulting
mountdata will be of the form
",ver=1,user=foo,pass=bar,ip=x.x.x.x,unc=\\server\share"
and hence results in the above error. This bug has been seen with older NAS
servers running Samba 3.0.24.
Fix this by moving the double delimiter check inside the conditional loop.

rpmsg: make sure inflight messages don't invoke just-removed callbacks
commit 15fd943af50dbc5f7f4de33835795c72595f7bf4 upstream.
When inbound messages arrive, rpmsg core looks up their associated
endpoint (by destination address) and then invokes their callback.
We've made sure that endpoints will never be de-allocated after they
were found by rpmsg core, but we also need to protect against the
(rare) scenario where the rpmsg driver was just removed, and its
callback function isn't available anymore.
This is achieved by introducing a callback mutex, which must be taken
before the callback is invoked, and, obviously, before it is removed.

rpmsg: avoid premature deallocation of endpoints
commit 5a081caa0414b9bbb82c17ffab9d6fe66edbb72f upstream.
When an inbound message arrives, the rpmsg core looks up its
associated endpoint and invokes the registered callback.
If a message arrives while its endpoint is being removed (because
the rpmsg driver was removed, or a recovery of a remote processor
has kicked in) we must ensure atomicity, i.e.:
- Either the ept is removed before it is found
or
- The ept is found but will not be freed until the callback returns
This is achieved by maintaining a per-ept reference count, which,
when drops to zero, will trigger deallocation of the ept.
With this in hand, it is now forbidden to directly deallocate
epts once they have been added to the endpoints idr.

nilfs2: ensure proper cache clearing for gc-inodes
commit fbb24a3a915f105016f1c828476be11aceac8504 upstream.
A gc-inode is a pseudo inode used to buffer the blocks to be moved by
garbage collection.
Block caches of gc-inodes must be cleared every time a garbage collection
function (nilfs\_clean\_segments) completes. Otherwise, stale blocks
buffered in the caches may be wrongly reused in successive calls of the GC
function.
For user files, this is not a problem because their gc-inodes are
distinguished by a checkpoint number as well as an inode number. They
never buffer different blocks if either an inode number, a checkpoint
number, or a block offset differs.
However, gc-inodes of sufile, cpfile and DAT file can store different data
for the same block offset. Thus, the nilfs\_clean\_segments function can
move incorrect block for these meta-data files if an old block is cached.
I found this is really causing meta-data corruption in nilfs.
This fixes the issue by ensuring cache clear of gc-inodes and resolves
reported GC problems including checkpoint file corruption, b-tree
corruption, and the following warning during GC.
nilfs\_palloc\_freev: entry number 307234 already freed.

powerpc: More fixes for lazy IRQ vs. idle
commit be2cf20a5ad31ebb13562c1c866ecc626fbd721e upstream.
Looks like we still have issues with pSeries and Cell idle code
vs. the lazy irq state. In fact, the reset fixes that went upstream
are exposing the problem more by causing BUG\_ON() to trigger (which
this patch turns into a WARN\_ON instead).
We need to be careful when using a variant of low power state that
has the side effect of turning interrupts back on, to properly set
all the SW & lazy state to look as if everything is enabled before
we enter the low power state with MSR:EE off as we will return with
MSR:EE on. If not, we have a discrepancy of state which can cause
things to go very wrong later on.
This patch moves the logic into a helper and uses it from the
pseries and cell idle code. The power4/970 idle code already got
things right (in assembly even !) so I'm not touching it. The power7
"bare metal" idle code is subtly different and correct. Remains PA6T
and some hypervisor based Cell platforms which have questionable
code in there, but they are mostly dead platforms so I'll fix them
when I manage to get final answers from the respective maintainers
about how the low power state actually works on them.

mm: fix slab->page \_count corruption when using slub
commit abca7c4965845924f65d40e0aa1092bdd895e314 upstream.
On arches that do not support this\_cpu\_cmpxchg\_double() slab\_lock is used
to do atomic cmpxchg() on double word which contains page->\_count. The
page count can be changed from get\_page() or put\_page() without taking
slab\_lock. That corrupts page counter.
Fix it by moving page->\_count out of cmpxchg\_double data. So that slub
does no change it while updating slub meta-data in struct page.

net: remove skb\_orphan\_try()
[ Upstream commit 62b1a8ab9b3660bb820d8dfe23148ed6cda38574 ]
Orphaning skb in dev\_hard\_start\_xmit() makes bonding behavior
unfriendly for applications sending big UDP bursts : Once packets
pass the bonding device and come to real device, they might hit a full
qdisc and be dropped. Without orphaning, the sender is automatically
throttled because sk->sk\_wmemalloc reaches sk->sk\_sndbuf (assuming
sk\_sndbuf is not too big)
We could try to defer the orphaning adding another test in
dev\_hard\_start\_xmit(), but all this seems of little gain,
now that BQL tends to make packets more likely to be parked
in Qdisc queues instead of NIC TX ring, in cases where performance
matters.

bnx2x: fix checksum validation
[ Upstream commit d6cb3e41386f20fb0777d0b59a2def82c65d37f7 ]
bnx2x driver incorrectly sets ip\_summed to CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY on
encapsulated segments. TCP stack happily accepts frames with bad
checksums, if they are inside a GRE or IPIP encapsulation.
Our understanding is that if no IP or L4 csum validation was done by the
hardware, we should leave ip\_summed as is (CHECKSUM\_NONE), since
hardware doesn't provide CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE support in its cqe.
Then, if IP/L4 checksumming was done by the hardware, set
CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY if no error was flagged.

netpoll: fix netpoll\_send\_udp() bugs
[ Upstream commit 954fba0274058d27c7c07b5ea07c41b3b7477894 ]
Bogdan Hamciuc diagnosed and fixed following bug in netpoll\_send\_udp() :
"skb->len += len;" instead of "skb\_put(skb, len);"
Meaning that \_if\_ a network driver needs to call skb\_realloc\_headroom(),
only packet headers would be copied, leaving garbage in the payload.
However the skb\_realloc\_headroom() must be avoided as much as possible
since it requires memory and netpoll tries hard to work even if memory
is exhausted (using a pool of preallocated skbs)
It appears netpoll\_send\_udp() reserved 16 bytes for the ethernet header,
which happens to work for typicall drivers but not all.
Right thing is to use LL\_RESERVED\_SPACE(dev)
(And also add dev->needed\_tailroom of tailroom)
This patch combines both fixes.
Many thanks to Bogdan for raising this issue.

bonding: Fix corrupted queue\_mapping
[ Upstream commit 5ee31c6898ea5537fcea160999d60dc63bc0c305 ]
In the transmit path of the bonding driver, skb->cb is used to
stash the skb->queue\_mapping so that the bonding device can set its
own queue mapping. This value becomes corrupted since the skb->cb is
also used in \_\_dev\_xmit\_skb.
When transmitting through bonding driver, bond\_select\_queue is
called from dev\_queue\_xmit. In bond\_select\_queue the original
skb->queue\_mapping is copied into skb->cb (via bond\_queue\_mapping)
and skb->queue\_mapping is overwritten with the bond driver queue.
Subsequently in dev\_queue\_xmit, \_\_dev\_xmit\_skb is called which writes
the packet length into skb->cb, thereby overwriting the stashed
queue mappping. In bond\_dev\_queue\_xmit (called from hard\_start\_xmit),
the queue mapping for the skb is set to the stashed value which is now
the skb length and hence is an invalid queue for the slave device.
If we want to save skb->queue\_mapping into skb->cb[], best place is to
add a field in struct qdisc\_skb\_cb, to make sure it wont conflict with
other layers (eg : Qdiscc, Infiniband...)
This patchs also makes sure (struct qdisc\_skb\_cb)->data is aligned on 8
bytes :
netem qdisc for example assumes it can store an u64 in it, without
misalignment penalty.
Note : we only have 20 bytes left in (struct qdisc\_skb\_cb)->data[].
The largest user is CHOKe and it fills it.

This reverts commit efa230f2c68abab817f13473077f8d0cc74f43f3.
BQL doesn't work with how this driver currently only takes TX
interrupts every 1/4 of the TX ring. That behavior needs to be fixed,
but that's a larger non-trivial task and for now we have to revert
BQL support as this makes the device currently completely unusable.

sky2: fix checksum bit management on some chips
[ Upstream commit 5ff0feac88ced864f44adb145142269196fa79d9 ]
The newer flavors of Yukon II use a different method for receive
checksum offload. This is indicated in the driver by the SKY2\_HW\_NEW\_LE
flag. On these newer chips, the BMU\_ENA\_RX\_CHKSUM should not be set.
The driver would get incorrectly toggle the bit, enabling the old
checksum logic on these chips and cause a BUG\_ON() assertion. If
receive checksum was toggled via ethtool.

/proc/net/ipv6\_route reflects the contents of fib\_table\_hash. The proc
handler is installed in ip6\_route\_net\_init() whereas fib\_table\_hash is
allocated in fib6\_net\_init() \_after\_ the proc handler has been installed.
This opens up a short time frame to access fib\_table\_hash with its pants
down.
Move the registration of the proc files to a later point in the init

cipso: handle CIPSO options correctly when NetLabel is disabled
[ Upstream commit 20e2a86485967c385d7c7befc1646e4d1d39362e ]
When NetLabel is not enabled, e.g. CONFIG\_NETLABEL=n, and the system
receives a CIPSO tagged packet it is dropped (cipso\_v4\_validate()
returns non-zero). In most cases this is the correct and desired
behavior, however, in the case where we are simply forwarding the
traffic, e.g. acting as a network bridge, this becomes a problem.
This patch fixes the forwarding problem by providing the basic CIPSO
validation code directly in ip\_options\_compile() without the need for
the NetLabel or CIPSO code. The new validation code can not perform
any of the CIPSO option label/value verification that
cipso\_v4\_validate() does, but it can verify the basic CIPSO option
format.
The behavior when NetLabel is enabled is unchanged.

powerpc/xmon: Use cpumask iterator to avoid warning
commit bc1d7702910c7c7e88eb60b58429dbfe293683ce upstream.
We have a bug report where the kernel hits a warning in the cpumask
code:
WARNING: at include/linux/cpumask.h:107
Which is:
WARN\_ON\_ONCE(cpu >= nr\_cpumask\_bits);
The backtrace is:
cpu\_cmd
cmds
xmon\_core
xmon
die
xmon is iterating through 0 to NR\_CPUS. I'm not sure why we are still
open coding this but iterating above nr\_cpu\_ids is definitely a bug.
This patch iterates through all possible cpus, in case we issue a
system reset and CPUs in an offline state call in.
Perhaps the old code was trying to handle CPUs that were in the
partition but were never started (eg kexec into a kernel with an
nr\_cpus= boot option). They are going to die way before we get into
xmon since we haven't set any kernel state up for them.

ARM: 7438/1: fill possible PMD empty section gaps
commit 19b52abe3c5d759661500a1dc810924369b2ad46 upstream.
On ARM with the 2-level page table format, a PMD entry is represented by
two consecutive section entries covering 2MB of virtual space.
However, static mappings always were allowed to use separate 1MB section
entries. This means in practice that a static mapping may create half
populated PMDs via create\_mapping().
Since commit 0536bdf33f (ARM: move iotable mappings within the vmalloc
region) those static mappings are located in the vmalloc area. We must
ensure no such half populated PMDs are accessible once vmalloc() or
ioremap() start looking at the vmalloc area for nearby free virtual
address ranges, or various things leading to a kernel crash will happen.

Commit f948501b36c6 ("Make hard\_irq\_disable() actually hard-disable
interrupts") caused check\_and\_cede\_processor to stop working.
->irq\_happened will never be zero right after a hard\_irq\_disable
so the compiler removes the call to cede\_processor completely.
The bug was introduced back in the lazy interrupt handling rework
of 3.4 but was hidden until recently because hard\_irq\_disable did
nothing.
This issue will eventually appear in 3.4 stable since the
hard\_irq\_disable fix is marked stable, so mark this one for stable
too.

As I was adding code that affects all archs, I started testing function

num=`wc -l t`
sed -ne "1,${num}p" t > t1
let num=num+1
sed -ne "${num},$p" t > t2
cat t1 > /debug/tracing/set\_ftrace\_filter
echo function /debug/tracing/current\_tracer
It finally came down to this function: restore\_interrupts()
I'm not sure why this locks up the system. It just seems to prevent
scheduling from occurring. Interrupts seem to still work, as I can ping
the box. But all user processes freeze.
When restore\_interrupts() is not traced, function tracing works fine.

ALSA: hda - Fix power-map regression for HP dv6 & co
commit 6e1c39c6b00d9141a82c231ba7c5e5b1716974b2 upstream.
The recent fix for power-map controls (commit b0791dda813) caused
regressions on some other HP laptops. They have fixed pins but these
pins are exposed as jack-detectable. Thus the driver tries to control
the power-map dynamically per jack detection where it never gets on.
This patch corrects the condition check for fixed pins so that the
power-map is set always for these pins.
NOTE: this is no simple backport from 3.5 kernel. Since 3.5 kernel
had significant code change in the relevant part, I fixed this
differently.

ALSA: hda - Add Realtek ALC280 codec support
commit befae82e2906cb7155020876a531b0b8c6c8d8c8 upstream.
This chip looks very similar to ALC269 and ALC27\* variants. The bug reporter
has verified that sound was working after this patch had been applied.

ARM: tegra: make tegra\_cpu\_reset\_handler\_enable() \_\_init
commit 6355f25ed965421725d92cf719fc63008690ca1c upstream.
This solves a section mismatch warning. I hadn't noticed this before,
because my compiler was inlining tegra\_cpu\_reset\_handler\_enable() inside
tegra\_cpu\_reset\_handler\_init(), which is already \_\_init, but I switched
compilers and it stopped doing that.
