Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis for CVE-2012-2495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client and Cisco Secure Desktop software. Specifically, the affected ActiveX and Java components used for WebLaunch do not properly validate the timestamps of downloaded software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Software Downgrade:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for an unauthenticated remote attacker to force a downgrade of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client or Cisco Secure Desktop software to an older, potentially vulnerable version.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to adequately check the authenticity and validity of downloaded software during the WebLaunch process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Software Downgrade:** An attacker can force the installation of an older software version that might contain other known vulnerabilities. This could expose the system to a wider range of attacks.
- **Compromised Security:** Downgrading software can remove security enhancements and patches present in the current version, leaving the system vulnerable to exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Malicious Website:** The primary attack vector involves convincing a user to visit a malicious website that hosts the vulnerable ActiveX control or Java applet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host a Website:** The attacker needs to control or have access to a website that can host the malicious ActiveX/Java components.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to employ social engineering tactics to lure a user to the malicious website.
- **No specific network position:** The attacker can be located anywhere as long as they can host a malicious website accessible by target users

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is related to the WebLaunch software update mechanism.
- The vulnerable components are cryptographically signed by Cisco, which may cause users to trust and execute the malicious components.
- Older versions of the client do not validate downloaded components which allows for downgrade attacks.
- The vulnerability affects systems that have installed affected versions of Cisco AnyConnect and Secure Desktop, as well as systems that haven't installed these clients, but access a page that instantiates the vulnerable component.
- Mitigations include applying software updates, setting kill-bits for vulnerable ActiveX controls, and blacklisting vulnerable Java applets
