Package        : asterisk
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2947 CVE-2012-2948
Debian Bug     : 675204 675210

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Asterisk, a PBX and
telephony toolkit.

CVE-2012-2947
	The IAX2 channel driver allows remote attackers to cause a
	denial of service (daemon crash) by placing a call on hold
	(when a certain mohinterpret setting is enabled).

CVE-2012-2948
	The Skinny channel driver allows remote authenticated users to
	cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon
	crash) by closing a connection in off-hook mode.

In addition, it was discovered that Asterisk does not set the
alwaysauthreject option by default in the SIP channel driver.  This
allows remote attackers to observe a difference in response behavior
and check for the presence of account names.  (CVE-2011-2666)  System
administrators concerned by this user enumerating vulnerability should
enable the alwaysauthreject option in the configuration.  We do not
plan to change the default setting in the stable version
(Asterisk 1.6) in order to preserve backwards compatibility.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:1.8.13.0~dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2012-007

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Remote crash vulnerability in IAX2 channel driver. |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Remote crash |
| **Susceptibility** | Established calls |
| **Severity** | Moderate |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | March 21, 2012 |
| **Reported By** | mgrobecker |
| **Posted On** | May 29, 2012 |
| **Last Updated On** | May 29, 2012 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Richard Mudgett < rmudgett AT digium DOT com > |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2012-2947 |

| **Description** | A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the IAX2 channel driver if an established call is placed on hold without a suggested music class. For this to occur, the following must take place:  1. The setting mohinterpret=passthrough must be set on the end placing the call on hold.  2. A call must be established.  3. The call is placed on hold without a suggested music-on-hold class name.    When these conditions are true, Asterisk will attempt to use an invalid pointer to a music-on-hold class name. Use of the invalid pointer will either cause a crash or the music-on-hold class name will be garbage. |

| **Resolution** | Asterisk now sets the extra data parameter to null if the received control frame does not have any extra data. |
