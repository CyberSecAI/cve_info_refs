Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-2536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. It occurs because System Center Configuration Manager improperly handles specially crafted requests. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the user's session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Reflected XSS: The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input within crafted URLs, allowing for arbitrary script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can inject client-side script into the user's browser. This script can then perform actions within the context of the user, such as spoofing content, disclosing information, or taking actions on the affected website as the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted URLs:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker relies on tricking the user into clicking the crafted URL, usually via email, instant messages, or malicious websites.
- **Compromised Websites:** Websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could also be used to deliver the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted URL that exploits the XSS vulnerability.
- The attacker also needs the ability to convince a user to click the malicious link.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Systems Management Server 2003 Service Pack 3 and Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2007 Service Pack 2.
- The provided document mentions that the update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how System Center Configuration Manager handles specially crafted requests.
- Microsoft rates this vulnerability as "Important".
- A workaround to mitigate this issue includes enabling the XSS filter in the Local Intranet security zone in Internet Explorer. However, this workaround might flag internal sites not previously considered XSS risks.
