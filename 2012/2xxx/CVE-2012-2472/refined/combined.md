## Important Notes

* Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability—Multiple vulnerabilities have been fixed for clientless SSL VPN in ASA software, so you should upgrade your software to a fixed version. See  <http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20141008-asa> for details about the vulnerability and a list of fixed ASA versions. Also, if you ever ran an earlier ASA version that had a vulnerable configuration, then regardless of the version you are currently running, you should verify that the portal customization was not compromised. If an attacker compromised a customization object in the past, then the compromised object stays persistent after you upgrade the ASA to a fixed version. Upgrading the ASA prevents this vulnerability from being exploited further, but it will not modify any customization objects that were already compromised and are still present on the system.
* Microsoft Kerberos Constrained Delegation support over clientless SSL VPN is limited to the following Web applications:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft Outlook Web Access

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft SharePoint

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Microsoft Internet Information Services

* Increased SSH security; the SSH default username is no longer supported—Starting in 8.4(2), you can no longer connect to the ASA using SSH with the  **pix** or  **asa** username and the login password. To use SSH, you must configure AAA authentication using the  **aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL** command (CLI) or Configuration > Device Management > Users/AAA > AAA Access > Authentication (ASDM); then define a local user by entering the  **username** command (CLI) or choosing Configuration > Device Management > Users/AAA > User Accounts (ASDM). If you want to use a AAA server for authentication instead of the local database, we recommend also configuring local authentication as a backup method.
* Configuration Migration for Transparent Mode—In 8.4, all transparent mode interfaces now belong to a bridge group. When you upgrade to 8.4, the existing two interfaces are placed in bridge group 1, and the management IP address is assigned to the Bridge Group Virtual Interface (BVI). The functionality remains the same when using one bridge group. You can now take advantage of the bridge group feature to configure up to four interfaces per bridge group and to create up to eight bridge groups in single mode or per context.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) In 8.3 and earlier, as an unsupported configuration, you could configure a management interface without an IP address, and you could access the interface using the device management address. In 8.4, the device management address is assigned to the BVI, and the management interface is no longer accessible using that IP address; the management interface requires its own IP address.

---

* You can upgrade from any previous release directly to 8.4. If you are upgrading from a pre-8.3 release, see the  [Cisco ASA 5500 Migration Guide for Version 8.3 and Later](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa83/upgrading/migrating.html)  for important information about migrating your configuration to Version 8.3 and later.

   Upgrading from some releases may have consequences for downgrading; be sure to back up your configuration file in case you want to downgrade. For example, If you are upgrading from a pre-8.2 release, see the 8.2 release notes for downgrade issues after you upgrade the Phone Proxy and MTA instance, or for downgrade issues if you upgrade the activation key with new 8.2 features.
* When upgrading to 8.4(2) from 8.3(1), 8.3(2), and 8.4(1), all identity NAT configurations will now include the  **no-proxy-arp** and  **route-lookup** keywords, to maintain existing functionality. The  **unidirectional** keyword is removed.
* The Advanced Inspection and Prevention Security Services Card (AIP SSC) can take up to 20 minutes to initialize the first time it boots after a new image is applied. This initialization process must complete before configuration changes can be made to the sensor. Attempts to modify and save configuration changes before the initialization completes will result in an error.
* Connection Profile/Tunnel Group terminology in CLI vs. ASDM—The ASA tunnel groups define the initial connection parameters and attributes (such as AAA, client address assignment, and connection alias/group-url) for a remote access VPN session. In the CLI they are referred to as  *tunnel groups*, whereas in ASDM they are referred to as  *Connection Profiles*. A VPN policy is an aggregation of Connection Profile, Group Policy, and Dynamic Access Policy authorization attributes.
* Cosmetic startup message issue on the ASA 5585-X—Cisco manufacturing recently discovered a process error that resulted in loading a test build of BIOS firmware on many early shipments of the ASA 5585-X. On the affected units, more text than usual displays on the console during startup before reaching the “rommon>” prompt. Included in the extra output is the following message banner:

CISCO SYSTEMS Spyker Build, TEST build not for Customer Release

Embedded BIOS Version 2.0(7)2 19:59:57 01/04/11

While you may see this additional text, there is no functional impact to the ASA operation; you can ignore the additional text. The test build provides additional information that can be used by engineers to pinpoint hardware problems during the manufacturing process. Unfortunately, there is no field-upgradeable resolution to eliminate this message that does not require replacing the hardware.

Hardware with a serial number that falls within the following ranges could be impacted by this cosmetic issue. Note that not all serial numbers within these ranges are impacted.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) JMX1449xxxx – JMX1520xxxx

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) JAF1450xxxx – JAF1516xxxx (for ASA-SSP-20-K8= only)

Hardware with the following Product IDs for the preceding serial numbers could be impacted by this cosmetic issue:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ASA5585-S20-K8

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ASA5585-S20-K9

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ASA5585-S20P20-K8

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ASA5585-S20P20-K9

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ASA5585-S20P20XK9

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ASA5585-S20X-K9

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ASA-SSP-20-K8=

## Limitations and Restrictions

* No SNMP Traps during insertion/removal of power supply (CSCul90037)—The power supplies in the ASA 5585-X are hot swappable field replaceable units. In the event of a power supply failure, an SNMP trap is sent from the ASA to the configured trap receiver. However, when you restore power, the ASA does not send an additional SNMP trap.

 **Workaround:** When using Cisco Prime Network to monitor ASA 5585s, the network operator must manually clear a power supply fault condition within the EMS.

* Currently in 8.4(2) and later, the PAT pool feature is not available as a fallback method for dynamic NAT or PAT. You can only configure the PAT pool as the primary method for dynamic PAT. For example, if you enter the following twice NAT command that configures a PAT pool (object2) for fallback when the addresses in object1 are used up, you see the following error message:

hostname(config)# **nat (inside,outside) source dynamic any object1 pat-pool object2 interface round-robin**

ERROR: Same mapped parameter cannot be used to do both NAT and PAT.

ERROR: NAT pool allocation failed.

You can alter this command to make it PAT-pool only by removing object1; the PAT pool is used as the primary method, instead of as a fallback method:

hostname(config)# **nat (inside,outside) source dynamic any pat-pool object2 interface round-robin**

(CSCtq20634)

* Clientless SSL VPN.NET limitation—Clientless SSL sessions might not properly support.NET framework applications. In some cases, you need to enable the application for use with Smart Tunnels; however, there is a chance it could still fail. For example, it might fail when an executable binary (.exe) is created using the.NET framework (CSCsv29942).
* With a heavy load of users (around 150 or more) using a WebVPN plugin, you may experience large delays because of the processing overload. Using Citrix web interface reduces the ASA rewrite overhead. To track the progress of the enhancement request to allow WebVPN plug files to be cached on the ASA, refer to CSCud11756.
* (ASA 5510, ASA 5520, ASA 5540, and ASA 5550 only) We strongly recommend that you enable hardware processing using the  **crypto engine large-mod-accel** command instead of software for large modulus operations such as 2048-bit certificates and DH5 keys. If you continue to use software processing for large keys, you could experience significant performance degradation due to slow session establishment for IPsec and SSL VPN connections. We recommend that you initially enable hardware processing during a low-use or maintenance period to minimize a temporary packet loss that can occur during the transition of processing from software to hardware.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) For the ASA 5540 and ASA 5550 using SSL VPN, in specific load conditions, you may want to continue to use software processing for large keys. If VPN sessions are added very slowly and the ASA runs at capacity, then the negative impact to data throughput is larger than the positive impact for session establishment.

The ASA 5580/5585-X platforms already integrate this capability; therefore, **crypto engine** commands are not applicable on these platforms.

### New Features in Version 8.4(7)

Released: September 3, 2013

There are no new features in Version 8.4(7).

### New Features in Version 8.4(6)

Released: April 29, 2013

 [Table 2](/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/release/notes/asarn84.html#17207)  lists the new features for ASA Version 8.4(6).

Table 2 New Features for ASA Version 8.4(6)

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Monitoring Features | |
| Ability to view top 10 memory users | You can now view the top bin sizes allocated and the top 10 PCs for each allocated bin size. Previously, you had to enter multiple commands to see this information (the  **show memory detail** command and the  **show memory binsize** command); the new command provides for quicker analysis of memory issues.  We introduced the following command:  **show memory top-usage**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), or 9.1(1).* |
| CPU profile enhancements | The  **cpu profile activate** command now supports the following:   * Delayed start of the profiler until triggered (global or specific thread CPU %) * Sampling of a single thread   We modified the following command:  **cpu profile activate** [ *n-samples* ] [ **sample-process**   *process-name* ] [ **trigger cpu-usage**  *cpu%* [ *process-name* ].  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), or 9.1(1).* |
| Remote Access Features | |
| **user-storage value** command password is now encrypted in  **show** commands | The password in the **user-storage value** command is now encrypted when you enter  **show running-config**.  We modified the following command:  **user-storage value**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), or 9.1(1).* |

### New Features in Version 8.4(5)

Released: October 31, 2012

 [Table 3](/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/release/notes/asarn84.html#93327)  lists the new features for ASA Version 8.4(5).

Table 3 New Features for ASA Version 8.4(5)

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Firewall Features | |
| EtherType ACL support for IS-IS traffic (transparent firewall mode) | In transparent firewall mode, the ASA can now pass IS-IS traffic using an EtherType ACL.  We modified the following command:  **access-list ethertype**  { **permit** |  **deny** }  **is-is**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), or 9.1(1).* |
| ARP cache additions for non-connected subnets | The ASA ARP cache only contains entries from directly-connected subnets by default. You can now enable the ARP cache to also include non-directly-connected subnets. We do not recommend enabling this feature unless you know the security risks. This feature could facilitate denial of service (DoS) attack against the ASA; a user on any interface could send out many ARP replies and overload the ASA ARP table with false entries.  You may want to use this feature if you use:   * Secondary subnets. * Proxy ARP on adjacent routes for traffic forwarding.   We introduced the following command:  **arp permit-nonconnected**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), or 8.7(1).* |
| Increased maximum connection limits for service policy rules | The maximum number of connections for service policy rules was increased from 65535 to 2000000.  We modified the following commands:  **set connection conn-max**,  **set connection embryonic-conn-max**,  **set connection per-client-embryonic-max**,  **set connection per-client-max**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), or 8.7(1).* |
| Remote Access Features | |
| Improved Host Scan and ASA Interoperability | Host Scan and the ASA use an improved process to transfer posture attributes from the client to the ASA. This gives the ASA more time to establish a VPN connection with the client and apply a dynamic access policy.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), or 9.1(1).* |
| Cisco Secure Desktop: Windows 8 Support | CSD 3.6.6215 was updated to enable selection of Windows 8 in the Prelogin Policy operating system check.  See the following limitations:   * Secure Desktop (Vault) is not supported with Windows 8. |
| Monitoring Features | |
| NAT-MIB cnatAddrBindNumberOfEntries and cnatAddrBindSessionCount OIDs to allow polling for Xlate count. | Support was added for the NAT-MIB cnatAddrBindNumberOfEntries and cnatAddrBindSessionCount OIDs to support xlate\_count and max\_xlate\_count for SNMP.  This data is equivalent to the  **show xlate count** command.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), or 9.1(1).* |
| NSEL | Flow-update events have been introduced to provide periodic byte counters for flow traffic. You can change the time interval at which flow-update events are sent to the NetFlow collector. You can filter to which collectors flow-update records will be sent.  We introduced the following command:  **flow-export active refresh-interval**.  We modified the following command:  **flow-export event-type**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), or 9.1(1).* |
| Hardware Features | |
| ASA 5585-X DC power supply support | Support was added for the ASA 5585-X DC power supply.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), or 9.1(1).* |

### New Features in Version 8.4(4.5)

Released: August 13, 2012

 [Table 4](/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/release/notes/asarn84.html#91181)  lists the new features forASA interim Version 8.4(4.5).

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Version 8.4(4.3) was removed from Cisco.com due to build issues; please upgrade to Version 8.4(4.5) or later.

---

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) We recommend that you upgrade to a Cisco.com-posted interim release only if you have a specific problem that it resolves. If you decide to run an interim release in a production environment, keep in mind that only targeted testing is performed on interim releases. Interim releases are fully supported by Cisco TAC and will remain on the download site only until the next maintenance release is available. If you choose to run an interim release, we strongly encourage you to upgrade to a fully-tested maintenance or feature release when it becomes available. We will document interim release features at the time of the next maintenance or feature release. For a list of resolved caveats for each interim release, see the interim release notes available on the Cisco.com software download site.

| NAT-MIB cnatAddrBindNumberOfEntries and cnatAddrBindSessionCount OIDs to allow polling for Xlate count. | Support was added for the NAT-MIB cnatAddrBindNumberOfEntries and cnatAddrBindSessionCount OIDs to support xlate\_count and max\_xlate\_count for SNMP.  This data is equivalent to the  **show xlate count** command.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), or 9.1(1).* |

Table 5 New Features for ASA Version 8.4(4.1)

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Certification Features | |
| FIPS and Common Criteria certifications | The FIPS 140-2 Non-Proprietary Security Policy was updated as part of the Level 2 FIPS 140-2 validation for the Cisco ASA 5500 series, which includes the Cisco ASA 5505, ASA 5510, ASA 5520, ASA 5540, ASA 5550, ASA 5580, and ASA 5585-X.  The Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level 4 (EAL4) was updated, which provides the basis for a specific Target of Evaluation (TOE) of the Cisco ASA and VPN platform solutions.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), 9.0(2), or 9.1(1).* |
| Support for administrator password policy when using the local database | When you configure authentication for CLI or ASDM access using the local database, you can configure a password policy that requires a user to change their password after a specified amount of time and also requires password standards such as a minimum length and the minimum number of changed characters.  We introduced or modified the following commands: **change-password**,  **password-policy lifetime**,  **password-policy minimum changes**,  **password-policy minimum-length**,  **password-policy minimum-lowercase**,  **password-policy minimum-uppercase**,  **password-policy minimum-numeric**,  **password-policy minimum-special**,  **password-policy authenticate enable**,  **clear configure password-policy**,  **show**  **running-config password-policy**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), 9.0(2), or 9.1(1).* |
| Support for SSH public key authentication | You can now enable public key authentication for SSH connections to the ASA on a per-user basis using Base64 key up to 2048 bits.  We introduced the following commands:  **ssh authentication**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), 9.0(2), or 9.1(1).* |
| Support for Diffie-Hellman Group 14 for the SSH Key Exchange | Support for Diffie-Hellman Group 14 for SSH Key Exchange was added. Formerly, only Group 1 was supported.  We introduced the following command:  **ssh key-exchange**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), 9.0(2), or 9.1(1).* |
| Support for a maximum number of management sessions | You can set the maximum number of simultaneous ASDM, SSH, and Telnet sessions.  We introduced the following commands:  **quota management-session**,  **show running-config quota management-session**,  **show quota management-session**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), 9.0(2), or 9.1(1).* |
| Additional ephemeral Diffie-Hellman ciphers for SSL encryption | The ASA now supports the following ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) SSL cipher suites:   * DHE-AES128-SHA1 * DHE-AES256-SHA1   These cipher suites are specified in RFC 3268,  *Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Ciphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS*).  When supported by the client, DHE is the preferred cipher because it provides Perfect Forward Secrecy. See the following limitations:   * DHE is not supported on SSL 3.0 connections, so make sure to also enable TLS 1.0 for the SSL server.  !! set server version  hostname(config)#  **ssl server-version tlsv1 sslv3**  !! set client version  hostname(config) #  **ssl**  **client-version any**     * Some popular applications do not support DHE, so include at least one other SSL encryption method to ensure that a cipher suite common to both the SSL client and server can be used. * Some clients may not support DHE, including AnyConnect 2.5 and 3.0, Cisco Secure Desktop, and Internet Explorer 9.0.   We modified the following command:  **ssl encryption**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), 9.0(2), or 9.1(1).* |
| Image verification | Support for SHA-512 image integrity checking was added.  We modified the following command:  **verify**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), 9.0(2), or 9.1(1).* |
| Improved pseudo-random number generation | Hardware-based noise for additional entropy was added to the software-based random number generation process. This change makes pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) more random and more difficult for attackers to get a repeatable pattern or guess the next random number to be used for encryption and decryption operations. Two changes were made to improve PRNG:   * Use the current hardware-based RNG for random data to use as one of the parameters for software-based RNG. * If the hardware-based RNG is not available, use additional hardware noise sources for software-based RNG. Depending on your model, the following hardware sensors are used:   – ASA 5505—Voltage sensors.  – ASA 5510 and 5550—Fan speed sensors.  – ASA 5520, 5540, and 5580—Temperature sensors.  – ASA 5585-X—Fan speed sensors.  We introduced the following commands:  **show debug menu cts** [ **128** |  **129** ]  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), 8.7(1), 9.0(1), 9.0(2), or 9.1(1).* |
| Remote Access Features | |
| Clientless SSL VPN: Enhanced quality for rewriter engines | The clientless SSL VPN rewriter engines were significantly improved to provide better quality and efficacy. As a result, you can expect a better end-user experience for clientless SSL VPN users.  We did not add or modify any commands for this feature.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), or 8.7(1).* |
| Failover Features | |
| Configure the connection replication rate during a bulk sync | You can now configure the rate at which the ASA replicates connections to the standby unit when using Stateful Failover. By default, connections are replicated to the standby unit during a 15 second period. However, when a bulk sync occurs (for example, when you first enable failover), 15 seconds may not be long enough to sync large numbers of connections due to a limit on the maximum connections per second. For example, the maximum connections on the ASA is 8 million; replicating 8 million connections in 15 seconds means creating 533 K connections per second. However, the maximum connections allowed per second is 300 K. You can now specify the rate of replication to be less than or equal to the maximum connections per second, and the sync period will be adjusted until all the connections are synced.  We introduced the following command:  **failover replication rate**  *rate*.  *This feature is not available in 8.6(1) or 8.7(1). This feature is also in 8.5(1.7).* |
| Application Inspection Features | |
| SunRPC change from dynamic ACL to pin-hole mechanism | Previously, Sun RPC inspection does not support outbound access lists because the inspection engine uses dynamic access lists instead of secondary connections.  In this release, when you configure dynamic access lists on the ASA, they are supported on the ingress direction only and the ASA drops egress traffic destined to dynamic ports. Therefore, Sun RPC inspection implements a pinhole mechanism to support egress traffic. Sun RPC inspection uses this pinhole mechanism to support outbound dynamic access lists.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), or 8.7(1).* |
| Inspection reset action change | Previously, when the ASA dropped a packet due to an inspection engine rule, the ASA sent only one RST to the source device of the dropped packet. This behavior could cause resource issues.  In this release, when you configure an inspection engine to use a reset action and a packet triggers a reset, the ASA sends a TCP reset under the following conditions:   * The ASA sends a TCP reset to the inside host when the  **service resetoutbound** command is enabled. (The  **service resetoutbound** command is disabled by default.) * The ASA sends a TCP reset to the outside host when the  **service resetinbound** command is enabled. (The  **service resetinbound** command is disabled by default.)   For more information, see the  **service** command in the ASA  *Cisco ASA 5500 Series Command Reference*.  This behavior ensures that a reset action will reset the connections on the ASA and on inside servers; therefore countering denial of service attacks. For outside hosts, the ASA does not send a reset by default and information is not revealed through a TCP reset.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1), 8.6(1), or 8.7(1).* |
| Module Features | |
| ASA 5585-X support for the ASA CX SSP-10 and -20 | The ASA CX module lets you enforce security based on the complete context of a situation. This context includes the identity of the user (who), the application or website that the user is trying to access (what), the origin of the access attempt (where), the time of the attempted access (when), and the properties of the device used for the access (how). With the ASA CX module, you can extract the full context of a flow and enforce granular policies such as permitting access to Facebook but denying access to games on Facebook or permitting finance employees access to a sensitive enterprise database but denying the same to other employees.  We introduced or modified the following commands:  **capture**,  **cxsc**,  **cxsc auth-proxy**,  **debug cxsc**, **hw-module module password-reset**,  **hw-module module reload**,  **hw-module module reset**,  **hw-module module shutdown**,  **session do setup host ip, session do get-config, session do password-reset, show asp table classify domain cxsc**,  **show asp table classify domain cxsc-auth-proxy**, **show capture**,  **show conn**,  **show module**,  **show service-policy**. |
| ASA 5585-X support for network modules | The ASA 5585-X now supports additional interfaces on network modules in slot 1. You can install one or two of the following optional network modules:   * ASA 4-port 10G Network Module * ASA 8-port 10G Network Module * ASA 20-port 1G Network Module   *This feature is not available in 9.0(1), 9.0(2), or 9.1(1).* |

### New Features in Version 8.4(3)

Released: January 9, 2012

 [Table 6](/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/release/notes/asarn84.html#75517)  lists the new features for ASA Version 8.4(3).

Table 6 New Features for ASA Version 8.4(3)

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| NAT Features | |
| Round robin PAT pool allocation uses the same IP address for existing hosts | When using a PAT pool with round robin allocation, if a host has an existing connection, then subsequent connections from that host will use the same PAT IP address if ports are available.  We did not modify any commands.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1).* |
| Flat range of PAT ports for a PAT pool | If available, the real source port number is used for the mapped port. However, if the real port is  *not* available, by default the mapped ports are chosen from the same range of ports as the real port number: 0 to 511, 512 to 1023, and 1024 to 65535. Therefore, ports below 1024 have only a small PAT pool.  If you have a lot of traffic that uses the lower port ranges, when using a PAT pool, you can now specify a flat range of ports to be used instead of the three unequal-sized tiers: either 1024 to 65535, or 1 to 65535.  We modified the following commands:  **nat dynamic** [ **pat-pool**   *mapped\_object* [ **flat** [ **include-reserve** ]]] (object network configuration mode) and  **nat source dynamic** [ **pat-pool**   *mapped\_object* [ **flat** [ **include-reserve** ]]] (global configuration mode).  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1).* |
| Extended PAT for a PAT pool | Each PAT IP address allows up to 65535 ports. If 65535 ports do not provide enough translations, you can now enable extended PAT for a PAT pool. Extended PAT uses 65535 ports per  *service*, as opposed to per IP address, by including the destination address and port in the translation information.  We modified the following commands:  **nat dynamic** [ **pat-pool**   *mapped\_object* [ **extended** ]] (object network configuration mode) and  **nat source dynamic** [ **pat-pool**   *mapped\_object*  [ **extended** ]] (global configuration mode).  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1).* |
| Configurable timeout for PAT xlate | When a PAT xlate times out (by default after 30 seconds), and the ASA reuses the port for a new translation, some upstream routers might reject the new connection because the previous connection might still be open on the upstream device. The PAT xlate timeout is now configurable, to a value between 30 seconds and 5 minutes.  We introduced the following command:  **timeout pat-xlate**.  *This feature is not available in 8.5(1).* |
| Automatic NAT rules to translate a VPN peer’s local IP address back to the peer’s real IP address | In rare situations, you might want to use a VPN peer’s real IP address on the inside network instead of an assigned local IP address. Normally with VPN, the peer is given an assigned local IP address to access the inside network. However, you might want to translate the local IP address back to the peer’s real public IP address if, for example, your inside servers and network security is based on the peer’s real IP address.  You can enable this feature on one interface per tunnel group. Object NAT rules are dynamically added and deleted when the VPN session is established or disconnected. You can view the rules using the  **show nat**  command.  **Note** Because of routing issues, we do not recommend using this feature unless you know you need this feature; contact Cisco TAC to confirm feature compatibility with your network. See the following limitations:   * Only supports Cisco IPsec and AnyConnect Client. * Return traffic to the public IP addresses must be routed back to the ASA so the NAT policy and VPN policy can be applied. * Does not support load-balancing (because of routing issues). * Does not support roaming (public IP changing).   We introduced the following command:  **nat-assigned-to-public-ip**  *interface* (tunnel-group general-attributes configuration mode). |
| Remote Access Features | |
| Clientless SSL VPN browser support | The ASA now supports clientless SSL VPN with Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 and Firefox 4. |
| Compression for DTLS and TLS | To improve throughput, Cisco now supports compression for DTLS and TLS on AnyConnect 3.0 or later. Each tunneling method configures compression separately, and the preferred configuration is to have both SSL and DTLS compression as LZS. This feature enhances migration from legacy VPN clients.  **Note** Using data compression on high speed remote access connections passing highly compressible data requires significant processing power on the ASA. With other activity and traffic on the ASA, the number of sessions that can be supported on the platform is reduced.  We introduced or modified the following commands:  **anyconnect dtls compression** [ **lzs** |  **none** ] and  **anyconnect ssl compression** [ **deflate** |  **lzs** |  **none** ]. |
| Clientless SSL VPN Session Timeout Alerts | Allows you to create custom messages to alert users that their VPN session is about to end because of inactivity or a session timeout.  We introduced the following commands:  **vpn-session-timeout alert-interval**,  **vpn-idle-timeout alert-interval**. |
| AAA Features | |
| Increased maximum LDAP values per attribute | The maximum number of values that the ASA can receive for a single attribute was increased from 1000 (the default) to 5000, with an allowed range of 500 to 5000. If a response message is received that exceeds the configured limit, the ASA rejects the authentication. If the ASA detects that a single attribute has more than 1000 values, then the ASA generates informational syslog 109036. For more than 5000 attributes, the ASA generates error level syslog 109037.  We introduced the following command:  **ldap-max-value-range**  *number* (Enter this command in aaa-server host configuration mode). |
| Support for sub-range of LDAP search results | When an LDAP search results in an attribute with a large number of values, depending on the server configuration, it might return a sub-range of the values and expect the ASA to initiate additional queries for the remaining value ranges. The ASA now makes multiple queries for the remaining ranges, and combines the responses into a complete array of attribute values. |
| Key vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) sent in RADIUS access request and accounting request packets from the ASA | Four New VSAs—Tunnel Group Name (146) and Client Type (150) are sent in RADIUS access request packets from the ASA. Session Type (151) and Session Subtype (152) are sent in RADIUS accounting request packets from the ASA. All four attributes are sent for all accounting request packet types: Start, Interim-Update, and Stop. The RADIUS server (for example, ACS and ISE) can then enforce authorization and policy attributes or use them for accounting and billing purposes. |
| Troubleshooting Features | |
| Regular expression matching for the  **show asp table classifier**  and **show asp table filter**  commands | You can now enter the  **show asp table classifier**  and **show asp table filter**  commands with a regular expression to filter output.  We modified the following commands:  **show asp table classifier match**  *regex*,  **show asp table filter match**  *regex*. |

### New Features in Version 8.4(2.8)

Released: August 31, 2011

 [Table 7](/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/release/notes/asarn84.html#16510)  lists the new features for ASA interim Version 8.4(2.8).

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) We recommend that you upgrade to a Cisco.com-posted ASA interim release only if you have a specific problem that it resolves. If you decide to run an interim release in a production environment, keep in mind that only targeted testing is performed on interim releases. Interim releases are fully supported by Cisco TAC and will usually remain on the download site only until the next maintenance release is available. If you choose to run an interim release, we strongly encourage you to upgrade to a fully-tested maintenance or feature release when it becomes available.

We will document interim release features at the time of the next maintenance or feature release. For a list of resolved caveats for each ASA interim release, see the interim release notes available on the Cisco.com software download site.

### New Features in Version 8.4(2)

Released: June 20, 2011

 [Table 8](/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/release/notes/asarn84.html#48166)  lists the new features for ASA Version 8.4(2).

Table 8 New Features for ASA Version 8.4(2)

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Firewall Features | |
| Identity Firewall | Typically, a firewall is not aware of the user identities and, therefore, cannot apply security policies based on identity.  The Identity Firewall in the ASA provides more granular access control based on users’ identities. You can configure access rules and security policies based on usernames and user groups name rather than through source IP addresses. The ASA applies the security policies based on an association of IP addresses to Windows Active Directory login information and reports events based on the mapped usernames instead of network IP addresses.  The Identity Firewall integrates with Window Active Directory in conjunction with an external Active Directory (AD) Agent that provides the actual identity mapping. The ASA uses Windows Active Directory as the source to retrieve the current user identity information for specific IP addresses.  In an enterprise, some users log onto the network by using other authentication mechanisms, such as authenticating with a web portal (cut-through proxy) or by using a VPN. You can configure the Identity Firewall to allow these types of authentication in connection with identity-based access policies.  We introduced or modified the following commands:  **user-identity enable**,  **user-identity default-domain**,  **user-identity domain**,  **user-identity logout-probe**,  **user-identity inactive-user-timer**,  **user-identity**  **poll-import-user-group-timer**,  **user-identity action netbios-response-fail**,  **user-identity user-not-found**,  **user-identity action ad-agent-down**,  **user-identity action mac-address-mismatch**,  **user-identity action domain-controller-down**,  **user-identity ad-agent active-user-database**,  **user-identity ad-agent hello-timer**,  **user-identity ad-agent aaa-server**,  **user-identity update import-user**,  **user-identity static user**,  **ad-agent-mode**,  **dns domain-lookup**,  **dns poll-timer**,  **dns expire-entry-timer**,  **object-group user, show user-identity, show dns**,  **clear configure user-identity**,  **clear dns, debug user-identity, test aaa-server ad-agent**. |
| Identity NAT configurable proxy ARP and route lookup | In earlier releases for identity NAT, proxy ARP was disabled, and a route lookup was always used to determine the egress interface. You could not configure these settings. In 8.4(2) and later, the default behavior for identity NAT was changed to match the behavior of other static NAT configurations: proxy ARP is enabled, and the NAT configuration determines the egress interface (if specified) by default. You can leave these settings as is, or you can enable or disable them discretely. Note that you can now also disable proxy ARP for regular static NAT.  For pre-8.3 configurations, the migration of NAT exempt rules (the  **nat 0 access-list** command) to 8.4(2) and later now includes the following keywords to disable proxy ARP and to use a route lookup:  **no-proxy-arp** and  **route-lookup**. The  **unidirectional** keyword that was used for migrating to 8.3(2) and 8.4(1) is no longer used for migration. When upgrading to 8.4(2) from 8.3(1), 8.3(2), and 8.4(1), all identity NAT configurations will now include the  **no-proxy-arp** and  **route-lookup** keywords, to maintain existing functionality. The  **unidirectional** keyword is removed.  We modified the following commands:  **nat static** [ **no-proxy-arp** ] [ **route-lookup** ] (object network) and  **nat source static** [ **no-proxy-arp** ] [ **route-lookup** ] (global). |
| PAT pool and round robin address assignment | You can now specify a pool of PAT addresses instead of a single address. You can also optionally enable round-robin assignment of PAT addresses instead of first using all ports on a PAT address before using the next address in the pool. These features help prevent a large number of connections from a single PAT address from appearing to be part of a DoS attack and makes configuration of large numbers of PAT addresses easy.  **Note** Currently in 8.4(2), the PAT pool feature is not available as a fallback method for dynamic NAT or PAT. You can only configure the PAT pool as the primary method for dynamic PAT (CSCtq20634).  We modifed the following commands:  **nat dynamic** [ **pat-pool**   *mapped\_object* [ **round-robin** ]] (object network) and  **nat source dynamic** [ **pat-pool**   *mapped\_object* [ **round-robin** ]] (global). |
| IPv6 Inspection | You can configure IPv6 inspection by configuring a service policy to selectively block IPv6 traffic based on the extension header. IPv6 packets are subjected to an early security check. The ASA always passes hop-by-hop and destination option types of extension headers while blocking router header and no next header.  You can enable default IPv6 inspection or customize IPv6 inspection. By defining a policy map for IPv6 inspection you can configure the ASA to selectively drop IPv6 packets based on following types of extension headers found anywhere in the IPv6 packet:   * Hop-by-Hop Options * Routing (Type 0) * Fragment * Destination Options * Authentication * Encapsulating Security Payload   We modified the following commands:  **policy-map type inspect ipv6, verify-header, match header, match header routing-type**,  **match header routing-address count gt, match header count gt**. |
| Remote Access Features | |
| Portal Access Rules | This enhancement allows customers to configure a global clientless SSL VPN access policy to permit or deny clientless SSL VPN sessions based on the data present in the HTTP header. If denied, an error code is returned to the clients. This denial is performed before user authentication and thus minimizes the use of processing resources.  We modified the following command:  **webvpn**  **portal-access-rule**.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| Clientless support for Microsoft Outlook Web App 2010 | The ASA 8.4(2) clientless SSL VPN core rewriter now supports Microsoft Outlook Web App 2010. |
| Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-2 Support for IPsec IKEv2 Integrity and PRF | This release supports the Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-2 for increased cryptographic hashing security for IPsec/IKEv2 AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client connections to the ASA. SHA-2 includes hash functions with digests of 256, 384, or 512 bits, to meet U.S. government requirements.  We modified the following commands:  **integrity**,  **prf, show crypto ikev2 sa detail**,  **show vpn-sessiondb detail remote**. |
| Secure Hash Algorithm SHA-2 Support for Digital Signature over IPsec IKEv2 | This release supports the use of SHA-2 compliant signature algorithms to authenticate IPsec IKEv2 VPN connections that use digital certificates, with the hash sizes SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  SHA-2 digital signature for IPsec IKEv2 connections is supported with the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, Version 3.0.1 or later. |
| Split Tunnel DNS policy for AnyConnect | This release includes a new policy pushed down to the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for resolving DNS addresses over split tunnels. This policy applies to VPN connections using the SSL or IPsec/IKEv2 protocol and instructs the AnyConnect client to resolve all DNS addresses through the VPN tunnel. If DNS resolution fails, the address remains unresolved and the AnyConnect client does not try to resolve the address through public DNS servers.  By default, this feature is disabled. The client sends DNS queries over the tunnel according to the split tunnel policy: tunnel all networks, tunnel networks specified in a network list, or exclude networks specified in a network list.  We introduced the following command: split-tunnel-all-dns.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| Mobile Posture  (formerly referred to as AnyConnect Identification Extensions for Mobile Device Detection) | You can now configure the ASA to permit or deny VPN connections to mobile devices, enable or disable mobile device access on a per group bases, and gather information about connected mobile devices based on a mobile device’s posture data. The following mobile platforms support this capability: AnyConnect for iPhone/iPad/iPod Versions 2.5.x and AnyConnect for Android Version 2.4.x.  Licensing Requirements  Enforcing remote access controls and gathering posture data from mobile devices requires an AnyConnect Mobile license and either an AnyConnect Essentials or AnyConnect Premium license to be installed on the ASA. You receive the following functionality based on the license you install:   * **AnyConnect Premium License Functionality**   Enterprises that install the AnyConnect Premium license will be able to enforce DAP policies, on supported mobile devices, based on these DAP attributes and any other existing endpoint attributes. This includes allowing or denying remote access from a mobile device.   * **AnyConnect Essentials License Functionality**   Enterprises that install the AnyConnect Essentials license will be able to do the following:  – Enable or disable mobile device access on a per group basis and to configure that feature using ASDM.  – Display information about connected mobile devices via CLI or ASDM without having the ability to enforce DAP policies or deny or allow remote access to those mobile devices.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| SSL SHA-2 digital signature | You can now use of SHA-2 compliant signature algorithms to authenticate SSL VPN connections that use digital certificates. Our support for SHA-2 includes all three hash sizes: SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. SHA-2 requires AnyConnect 2.5(1) or later (2.5(2) or later recommended). This release does not support SHA-2 for other uses or products.  Caution: To support failover of SHA-2 connections, the standby ASA must be running the same image.  We modified the following command:  **show crypto ca certificate** (the Signature Algorithm field identifies the digest algorithm used when generating the signature).  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| SHA2 certificate signature support for Microsoft Windows 7 and Android-native VPN clients | ASA supports SHA2 certificate signature support for Microsoft Windows 7 and Android-native VPN clients when using the L2TP/IPsec protocol.  We did not modify any commands.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| Enable/disable certificate mapping to override the group-url attribute | This feature changes the preference of a connection profile during the connection profile selection process. By default, if the ASA matches a certificate field value specified in a connection profile to the field value of the certificate used by the endpoint, the ASA assigns that profile to the VPN connection. This optional feature changes the preference to a connection profile that specifies the group URL requested by the endpoint. The new option lets administrators rely on the group URL preference used by many older ASA software releases.  We introduced the following command:  **tunnel-group-preference**.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| ASA 5585-X Features | |
| Support for Dual SSPs for SSP-40 and SSP-60 | For SSP-40 and SSP-60, you can use two SSPs of the same level in the same chassis. Mixed-level SSPs are not supported (for example, an SSP-40 with an SSP-60 is not supported). Each SSP acts as an independent device, with separate configurations and management. You can use the two SSPs as a failover pair if desired.  **Note** When using two SSPs in the chassis, VPN is not supported; note, however, that VPN has not been disabled.  We modified the following commands:  **show module**,  **show inventory**,  **show environment**. |
| Support for the IPS SSP-10, -20, -40, and -60 | We introduced support for the IPS SSP-10, -20, -40, and -60 for the ASA 5585-X. You can only install the IPS SSP with a matching-level SSP; for example, SSP-10 and IPS SSP-10.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| CSC SSM Features | |
| CSC SSM Support | For the CSC SSM, support for the following features has been added:   * HTTPS traffic redirection: URL filtering and WRS queries for incoming HTTPS connections. * Configuring global approved whitelists for incoming and outgoing SMTP and POP3 e-mail. * E-mail notification for product license renewals.   We did not modify any commands. |
| Monitoring Features | |
| Smart Call-Home Anonymous Reporting | Customers can now help to improve the ASA platform by enabling Anonymous Reporting, which allows Cisco to securely receive minimal error and health information from the device.  We introduced the following commands:  **call-home reporting anonymous, call-home test reporting anonymous**.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| IF-MIB ifAlias OID support | The ASA now supports the ifAlias OID. When you browse the IF-MIB, the ifAlias OID will be set to the value that has been set for the interface description.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| Interface Features | |
| Support for Pause Frames for Flow Control on 1-Gigabit Ethernet Interface | You can now enable pause (XOFF) frames for flow control on 1-Gigabit Ethernet interfaces; support was previously added for 10-Gigabit Ethernet interfaces in 8.2(2).  We modified the following command:  **flowcontrol**.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| Management Features | |
| Increased SSH security; the SSH default username is no longer supported | Starting in 8.4(2), you can no longer connect to the ASA using SSH with the  **pix** or  **asa** username and the login password. To use SSH, you must configure AAA authentication using the  **aaa authentication ssh console LOCAL** command (CLI) or Configuration > Device Management > Users/AAA > AAA Access > Authentication (ASDM); then define a local user by entering the  **username** command (CLI) or choosing Configuration > Device Management > Users/AAA > User Accounts (ASDM). If you want to use a AAA server for authentication instead of the local database, we recommend also configuring local authentication as a backup method. |
| Unified Communications Features | |
| ASA-Tandberg Interoperability with H.323 Inspection | H.323 Inspection now supports uni-directional signaling for two-way video sessions. This enhancement allows H.323 Inspection of one-way video conferences supported by Tandberg video phones. Supporting uni-directional signaling allows Tandberg phones to switch video modes (close their side of an H.263 video session and reopen the session using H.264, the compression standard for high-definition video).  We did not modify any commands.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| Routing Features | |
| Timeout for connections using a backup static route | When multiple static routes exist to a network with different metrics, the ASA uses the one with the best metric at the time of connection creation. If a better route becomes available, then this timeout lets connections be closed so a connection can be reestablished to use the better route. The default is 0 (the connection never times out). To take advantage of this feature, change the timeout to a new value.  We modified the following command:  **timeout floating-conn**.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |

### New Features in Version 8.4(1.11)

Released: May 20, 2011

 [Table 9](/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/release/notes/asarn84.html#72533)  lists the new features forASA interim Version 8.4(1.11).

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note**![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) We recommend that you upgrade to a Cisco.com-posted interim release only if you have a specific problem that it resolves. If you decide to run an interim release in a production environment, keep in mind that only targeted testing is performed on interim releases. Interim releases are fully supported by Cisco TAC and will remain on the download site only until the next maintenance release is available. If you choose to run an interim release, we strongly encourage you to upgrade to a fully-tested maintenance or feature release when it becomes available. We will document interim release features at the time of the next maintenance or feature release. For a list of resolved caveats for each interim release, see the interim release notes available on the Cisco.com software download site.

Table 9 New Features for ASA Version 8.4(1.11)

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Firewall Features | |
| PAT pool and round robin address assignment | You can now specify a pool of PAT addresses instead of a single address. You can also optionally enable round-robin assignment of PAT addresses instead of first using all ports on a PAT address before using the next address in the pool. These features help prevent a large number of connections from a single PAT address from appearing to be part of a DoS attack and makes configuration of large numbers of PAT addresses easy.  **Note** Currently in 8.4(1.11), the PAT pool feature is not available as a fallback method for dynamic NAT or PAT. You can only configure the PAT pool as the primary method for dynamic PAT (CSCtq20634).  We modifed the following commands:  **nat dynamic** [ **pat-pool**   *mapped\_object* [ **round-robin** ]] (object network) and  **nat source dynamic** [ **pat-pool**   *mapped\_object* [ **round-robin** ]] (global). |

### New Features in Version 8.4(1)

Released: January 31, 2011

 [Table 10](/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa84/release/notes/asarn84.html#27682)  lists the new features for ASA Version 8.4(1).

Table 10 New Features for ASA Version 8.4(1)

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Hardware Features | |
| Support for the ASA 5585-X | We introduced support for the ASA 5585-X with Security Services Processor (SSP)-10, -20, -40, and -60.  **Note** Support was previously added in 8.2(3) and 8.2(4); the ASA 5585-X is not supported in 8.3(x). |
| No Payload Encryption hardware for export | You can purchase the ASA 5585-X with No Payload Encryption. For export to some countries, payload encryption cannot be enabled on the Cisco ASA 5500 series. The ASA software senses a No Payload Encryption model, and disables the following features:   * Unified Communications * VPN   You can still install the Strong Encryption (3DES/AES) license for use with management connections. For example, you can use ASDM HTTPS/SSL, SSHv2, Telnet and SNMPv3. You can also download the dynamic database for the Botnet Traffic Filer (which uses SSL). |
| Remote Access Features | |
| L2TP/IPsec Support on Android Platforms | We now support VPN connections between Android mobile devices and ASA 5500 series devices, when using the L2TP/IPsec protocol and the native Android VPN client. Mobile devices must be using the Android 2.1, or later, operating system.  *Also available in Version 8.2(5).* |
| UTF-8 Character Support for AnyConnect Passwords | AnyConnect 3.0 used with ASA 8.4(1), supports UTF-8 characters in passwords sent using RADIUS/MSCHAP and LDAP protocols. |
| IPsec VPN Connections with IKEv2 | Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) is the latest key exchange protocol used to establish and control Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) tunnels. The ASA now supports IPsec with IKEv2 for the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, Version 3.0(1), for all client operating systems.  On the ASA, you enable IPsec connections for users in the group policy. For the AnyConnect client, you specify the primary protocol (IPsec or SSL) for each ASA in the server list of the client profile.  IPsec remote access VPN using IKEv2 was added to the AnyConnect Essentials and AnyConnect Premium licenses.  Site-to-site sessions were added to the Other VPN license (formerly IPsec VPN). The Other VPN license is included in the Base license.  We modified the following commands:  **vpn-tunnel-protocol**,  **crypto ikev2 policy**,  **crypto ikev2 enable**,  **crypto ipsec ikev2**,  **crypto dynamic-map**,  **crypto map**. |
| SSL SHA-2 digital signature | This release supports the use of SHA-2 compliant signature algorithms to authenticate SSL VPN connections that use digital certificates. Our support for SHA-2 includes all three hash sizes: SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. SHA-2 requires AnyConnect 2.5.1 or later (2.5.2 or later recommended). This release does not support SHA-2 for other uses or products. This feature does not involve configuration changes.  Caution: To support failover of SHA-2 connections, the standby ASA must be running the same image. To support this feature, we added the Signature Algorithm field to the  **show crypto ca certificate command** to identify the digest algorithm used when generating the signature. |
| SCEP Proxy | SCEP Proxy provides the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client with support for automated third-party certificate enrollment. Use this feature to support AnyConnect with zero-touch, secure deployment of device certificates to authorize endpoint connections, enforce policies that prevent access by non-corporate assets, and track corporate assets. This feature requires an AnyConnect Premium license and will not work with an Essentials license.  We introduced or modified the following commands:  **crypto ikev2 enable**,  **scep-enrollment enable**,  **scep-forwarding-url**,  **debug crypto ca scep-proxy**,  **secondary-username-from-certificate**,  **secondary-pre-fill-username**. |
| Host Scan Package Support | This feature provides the necessary support for the ASA to install or upgrade a Host Scan package and enable or disable Host Scan. This package may either be a standalone Host Scan package or one that ASA extracts from an AnyConnect Next Generation package.  In previous releases of AnyConnect, an endpoint’s posture was determined by Cisco Secure Desktop (CSD). Host Scan was one of many features bundled in CSD. Unbundling Host Scan from CSD gives AnyConnect administrators greater freedom to update and install Host Scan separately from the other features of CSD.  We introduced the following command:  **csd hostscan image path**. |
| Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD) | This release implements the KCD protocol transition and constrained delegation extensions on the ASA. KCD provides Clientless SSL VPN (also known as WebVPN) users with SSO access to any web services protected by Kerberos. Examples of such services or applications include Outlook Web Access (OWA), Sharepoint, and Internet Information Server (IIS).  Implementing protocol transition allows the ASA to obtain Kerberos service tickets on behalf of remote access users without requiring them to authenticate to the KDC (through Kerberos). Instead, a user authenticates to ASA using any of the supported authentication mechanisms, including digital certificates and Smartcards, for Clientless SSL VPN (also known as WebVPN). When user authentication is complete, the ASA requests and obtains an impersonate ticket, which is a service ticket for ASA on behalf of the user. The ASA may then use the impersonate ticket to obtain other service tickets for the remote access user.  Constrained delegation provides a way for domain administrators to limit the network resources that a service trusted for delegation (for example, the ASA) can access. This task is accomplished by configuring the account under which the service is running to be trusted for delegation to a specific instance of a service running on a specific computer.  We modified the following commands:  **kcd-server**,  **clear aaa**,  **show aaa**,  **test aaa-server authentication**. |
| Clientless SSL VPN browser support | The ASA now supports clientless SSL VPN with Apple Safari 5. |
| Clientless VPN Auto Sign-on Enhancement | Smart tunnel now supports HTTP-based auto sign-on on Firefox as well as Internet Explorer. Similar to when Internet Explorer is used, the administrator decides to which hosts a Firefox browser will automatically send credentials. For some authentication methods, if may be necessary for the administrator to specify a realm string on the ASA to match that on the web application (in the Add Smart Tunnel Auto Sign-on Server window). You can now use bookmarks with macro substitutions for auto sign-on with Smart tunnel as well.  The POST plug-in is now obsolete. The former POST plug-in was created so that administrators could specify a bookmark with sign-on macros and receive a kick-off page to load prior to posting the the POST request. The POST plug-in approach allows requests that required the presence of cookies, and other header items, fetched ahead of time to go through. The administrator can now specify pre-load pages when creating bookmarks to achieve the same functionality. Same as the POST plug-in, the administrator specifies the pre-load page URL and the URL to send the POST request to.  You can now replace the default preconfigured SSL VPN portal with your own portal. The administrators do this by specifying a URL as an External Portal. Unlike the group-policy home page, the External Portal supports POST requests with macro substitution (for auto sign-on) as well as pre-load pages.  We introduced or modified the following command:  **smart-tunnel auto-signon**. |
| Expanded Smart Tunnel application support | Smart Tunnel adds support for the following applications:   * *Microsoft Outlook Exchange Server 2010 (native support).*   Users can now use Smart Tunnel to connect Microsoft Office Outlook to a Microsoft Exchange Server.   * Microsoft Sharepoint/Office 2010.   Users can now perform remote file editing using Microsoft Office 2010 Applications and Microsoft Sharepoint by using Smart Tunnel. |
| Interface Features | |
| EtherChannel support (ASA 5510 and higher) | You can configure up to 48 802.3ad EtherChannels of eight active interfaces each.  **Note** You cannot use interfaces on the 4GE SSM, including the integrated 4GE SSM in slot 1 on the ASA 5550, as part of an EtherChannel.  We introduced the following commands:  **channel-group**,  **lacp port-priority**,  **interface port-channel**,  **lacp max-bundle**,  **port-channel min-bundle**,  **port-channel load-balance**,  **lacp system-priority**,  **clear lacp counters**,  **show lacp**,  **show port-channel**. |
| Bridge groups for transparent mode | If you do not want the overhead of security contexts, or want to maximize your use of security contexts, you can group interfaces together in a bridge group, and then configure multiple bridge groups, one for each network. Bridge group traffic is isolated from other bridge groups. You can configure up to 8 bridge groups in single mode or per context in multiple mode, with 4 interfaces maximum per bridge group.  **Note** Although you can configure multiple bridge groups on the ASA 5505, the restriction of 2 data interfaces in transparent mode on the ASA 5505 means you can only effectively use 1 bridge group.  We introduced the following commands:  **interface bvi**,  **bridge-group**,  **show bridge-group**. |
| Scalability Features | |
| Increased contexts for the ASA 5550, 5580, and 5585-X | For the ASA 5550 and ASA 5585-X with SSP-10, the maximum contexts was increased from 50 to 100. For the ASA 5580 and 5585-X with SSP-20 and higher, the maximum was increased from 50 to 250. |
| Increased VLANs for the ASA 5580 and 5585-X | For the ASA 5580 and 5585-X, the maximum VLANs was increased from 250 to 1024. |
| Additional platform support | Google Chrome has been added as a supported platform for ASA Version 8.4. Both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms are supported on Windows XP, Vista, and 7 and Mac OS X Version 6.0. |
| Increased connections for the ASA 5580 and 5585-X | We increased the firewall connection limits:   * ASA 5580-20—1,000,000 to 2,000,000. * ASA 5580-40—2,000,000 to 4,000,000. * ASA 5585-X with SSP-10: 750,000 to 1,000,000. * ASA 5585-X with SSP-20: 1,000,000 to 2,000,000. * ASA 5585-X with SSP-40: 2,000,000 to 4,000,000. * ASA 5585-X with SSP-60: 2,000,000 to 10,000,000. |
| Increased AnyConnect VPN sessions for the ASA 5580 | The AnyConnect VPN session limit was increased from 5,000 to 10,000. |
| Increased Other VPN sessions for the ASA 5580 | The other VPN session limit was increased from 5,000 to 10,000. |
| High Availability Features | |
| Stateful Failover with Dynamic Routing Protocols | Routes that are learned through dynamic routing protocols (such as OSPF and EIGRP) on the active unit are now maintained in a Routing Information Base (RIB) table on the standby unit. Upon a failover event, traffic on the secondary active unit now passes with minimal disruption because routes are known. Routes are synchronized only for link-up or link-down events on an active unit. If the link goes up or down on the standby unit, dynamic routes sent from the active unit may be lost. This is normal, expected behavior.  We modified the following commands: **show failover**,  **show route**,  **show route failover**. |
| Unified Communication Features | |
| UC Protocol Inspection Enhancements | SIP Inspection and SCCP Inspection are enhanced to support new features in the Unified Communications Solutions; such as, SCCP v2.0 support, support for GETPORT messages in SCCP Inspection, SDP field support in INVITE messages with SIP Inspection, and QSIG tunneling over SIP. Additionally, the Cisco Intercompany Media Engine supports Cisco RT Lite phones and third-party video endpoints (such as, Tandberg).  We did not modify any commands. |
| Inspection Features | |
| DCERPC Enhancement | DCERPC Inspection was enhanced to support inspection of RemoteCreateInstance RPC messages.  We did not modify an commands. |
| Troubleshooting and Monitoring Features | |
| SNMP traps and MIBs | Supports the following additional keywords:  **connection-limit-reached**,  **entity**  **cpu-temperature**,  **cpu threshold rising**,  **entity**  **fan-failure**,  **entity power-supply**,  **ikev2 stop | start**,  **interface-threshold**,  **memory-threshold**,  **nat**  **packet-discard**,  **warmstart**.  The entPhysicalTable reports entries for sensors, fans, power supplies, and related components.  Supports the following additional MIBs: ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB, CISCO-ENTITY-SENSOR-EXT-MIB, CISCO-ENTITY-FRU-CONTROL-MIB, CISCO-PROCESS-MIB, CISCO-ENHANCED-MEMPOOL-MIB, CISCO-L4L7MODULE-RESOURCE-LIMIT-MIB, NAT-MIB, EVENT-MIB, EXPRESSION-MIB  Supports the following additional traps: warmstart, cpmCPURisingThreshold, mteTriggerFired, cirResourceLimitReached, natPacketDiscard, ciscoEntSensorExtThresholdNotification.  We introduced or modified the following commands:  **snmp cpu threshold rising**,  **snmp interface threshold**,  **snmp-server enable traps**. |
| TCP Ping Enhancement | TCP ping allows users whose ICMP echo requests are blocked to check connectivity over TCP. With the TCP ping enhancement you can specify a source IP address and a port and source interface to send pings to a hostname or an IPv4 address.  We modified the following command:  **ping tcp**. |
| Show Top CPU Processes | You can now monitor the processes that run on the CPU to obtain information related to the percentage of the CPU used by any given process. You can also see information about the load on the CPU, broken down per process, at 5 minutes, 1 minute, and 5 seconds prior to the log time. Information is updated automatically every 5 seconds to provide real-time statistics, and a refresh button in the pane allows a manual data refresh at any time.  We introduced the following command:  **show process cpu-usage sorted**. |
| General Features | |
| Password Encryption Visibility | You can show password encryption in a security context.  We modified the following command:  **show password encryption**. |
