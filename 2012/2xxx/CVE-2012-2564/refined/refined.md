The provided content is related to CVE-2012-2564.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Bloxx administrative interface lacks CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in all functions of the Bloxx administrative interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious user can force a Bloxx administrator to execute unwanted actions on the Bloxx administrative interface while authenticated. This could lead to information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious user crafts a specialized webpage and forces a Bloxx administrator to visit it while they are authenticated to the Bloxx administrative interface. The administrator does not necessarily need to have a window open to the admin interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page and be able to get a Bloxx administrator to visit the page. The attacker does not require access to the Bloxx system or credentials to exploit the CSRF.
