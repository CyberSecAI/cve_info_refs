How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An application or mosh-server can send a large value as the "repeat count" of an ANSI escape sequence, causing the mosh-server or mosh-client to spend a lot of CPU time interpreting a short ANSI escape sequence.  Because these applications are already trusted, this is not a security vulnerability per se. For example, the application is also able to shut off the user's keyboard with an ANSI escape sequence -- also not a security vulnerability. Because ANSI escape sequences can do arbitrary things to the user's terminal, programs that allow untrusted user-to-user communication (including write(1), wall(1), and e-mail and newsgroup readers) need to filter these out.  Mosh 1.2.1 will contain code to avoid spending all this CPU time by ignoring nonsensical repeat counts. But in general, any terminal emulator must trust the application, since the application decides what should be on the screen. If it wants to fill the screen with garbage or send a lot of beeps or turn off the user's keyboard, most terminal emulators will do what the applicaiton asks. These are matters of discretion and are not security vulnerabilities. (Similarly, the mosh-client must trust the mosh-server to decide what is on the screen and whether to accept user input.)  We have suggested this text as the issue description:  === Mosh versions 1.2 and earlier allow an application to cause the mosh-server to consume large amounts of CPU time with a short ANSI escape sequence. In addition, a malicious mosh-server can cause the mosh-client to consume large amounts of CPU time with a short ANSI escape sequence. This arises because there was no limit on the value of the "repeat" parameter in some ANSI escape sequences, so even large and nonsensical values would be interpreted by Mosh's terminal emulator. ===  This gets away from the suggestion that the problem relates to "improper parsing" or the "count of parameters" (it's about wanting a limit on the _value_ of parameters so the terminal emulator doesn't do huge amounts of work to execute a very short sequence), or to data coming from "a remote attacker."  Thank you, Keith Winstein Mosh project   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=823943#c6)  Stefan Cornelius    2012-06-15 08:40:21 UTC  ``` Created mosh tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-all [[bug 832351](show_bug.cgi?id=832351 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-2385 mosh: mosh server DoS (long loop) due improper parsing of terminal parameters in terminal dispatcher [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=823943#c7)  Fedora Update System    2012-06-26 00:44:42 UTC  ``` mosh-1.2.2-1.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.

## Description

[![@lindi2](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/390702?v=4&size=48)](/lindi2)[lindi2](https://github.com/lindi2)opened [on May 15, 2012](https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues/271#issue-4581899)

The commands

echo -en "\e[2147483647L"

echo -en "\e[2147483647M"

echo -en "\e[2147483647@"

echo -en "\e[2147483647P"
