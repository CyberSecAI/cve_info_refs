Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks within the Moodle calendar module. Specifically, users without the necessary rights to create calendar entries were still able to access the "new calendar entry" page and successfully create events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly enforce role-based access control when accessing the calendar entry creation functionality. The system did not correctly verify if the user had the 'calendar:manageentries' capability before granting access to create a new entry.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Calendar Manipulation:** An attacker could create calendar entries even if they lacked the intended permissions, potentially disrupting scheduled events, adding spam entries, or creating confusion. While classified as "Minor" in severity, the unauthorized modification of calendar data could have implications for courses and activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Access to Calendar Entry Page:** Attackers exploited the vulnerability by directly accessing the calendar's "new entry" page without having the required permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the Moodle platform.
- **Lack of Specific Calendar Permissions:** The attacker needs to be a user without the correct permissions to create calendar entries.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in Moodle versions 2.2 to 2.2.2+, 2.1 to 2.1.5+, 2.0 to 2.0.8+, and 1.9 to 1.9.17+.
- The fix for this issue involved adding proper permission checks to ensure only users with the 'calendar:manageentries' capability could create new calendar events.
- The Moodle tracker issue associated with this vulnerability is MDL-18335.
