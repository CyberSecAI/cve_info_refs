{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2012-2378",
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way Apache CXF enforced child policies of WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 on the client side. In certain circumstances, this could lead a client failing to sign or encrypt certain elements as directed by the security policy, leading to information disclosure and insecure transmission of information.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "Apache CXF did not correctly apply certain child policies of WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 SupportingToken policy assertions on the client side.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Certain child policies of a WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 SupportingToken policy, including AlgorithmSuite, SignedParts, SignedElements, EncryptedParts, and EncryptedElements, are not enforced on the client side when a SupportingToken is used to sign or encrypt parts or elements of a SOAP message."
      ],
        "impact": "A client may fail to sign or encrypt certain elements as directed by the security policy. This can lead to information disclosure and insecure transmission of information, as confidential information might be transmitted without the appropriate security measures and potentially circumvent access controls on web services.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker could exploit this by crafting SOAP messages that are missing expected signatures or encryption, if those are associated with a SupportingToken policy."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a vulnerable Apache CXF client and to have a security policy which specifies certain child policies of a WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1 SupportingToken, as defined in the description."
