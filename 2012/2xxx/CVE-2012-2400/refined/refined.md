Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2400:

**Verification:**

The provided documents mention CVE-2012-2400 in the Debian Security Advisory DSA-2670-1. This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is within the SWFObject library, which is a third-party library used by WordPress.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability is a security issue within the SWFObject library. The advisory notes that "Three external libraries included in WordPress received security updates: SWFObject, which WordPress previously used to embed Flash content, and may still be in use by plugins and themes." This indicates the vulnerability is within the library itself and not in WordPress's implementation.
*   **Impact:** The provided text does not specifically detail the impact of the vulnerability, but given that the advisory is a *security* update, the vulnerability likely leads to some form of security compromise such as:

    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS)
    *   Arbitrary code execution, if the attacker can control the Flash content.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The specific attack vector is not detailed, but based on the type of library (used for embedding Flash content) and typical Flash vulnerabilities, the attack vector may involve:

    *   Crafting malicious Flash content that exploits a vulnerability in the SWFObject library.
    *   Embedding this malicious content on a website, which will be executed by a victim's browser if it loads the page
    *   If successful, this could lead to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) or arbitrary code execution on the client side
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to embed or inject malicious Flash content, or otherwise control the Flash files loaded onto a page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The update to WordPress 3.3.2 addresses security vulnerabilities in multiple third-party libraries: Plupload, SWFUpload, and SWFObject.
*   The WordPress update includes fixes for other security vulnerabilities, including privilege escalation and cross-site scripting.
*   The provided changeset shows the update of the `swfobject.js` file. The main change is the replacement of `encodeURI` to `~~O.location~~.toString().replace(/&/g,"%26")` with `encodeURIComponent(O.location)`.

**Summary**

The vulnerability, CVE-2012-2400, resides in the SWFObject library, which was used by WordPress to embed Flash content. The security update in WordPress 3.3.2 addresses this and other security issues to prevent potential exploitation. The provided information does not elaborate on the technical specifics of the SWFObject vulnerability itself.
