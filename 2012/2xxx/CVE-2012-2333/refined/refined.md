  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2012-2333",
    "Description": "A integer underflow vulnerability was found in the way OpenSSL handled DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) application data record lengths when using a block cipher in CBC (cipher-block chaining) mode. A malicious DTLS client or server could use this flaw to crash its DTLS connection peer.",
    "Root_cause": "Integer underflow in the way OpenSSL handled DTLS application data record lengths when using a block cipher in CBC mode.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Underflow",
      "Buffer Over-read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious DTLS client or server could use this flaw to crash its DTLS connection peer, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted DTLS packets sent from a client to server, or server to client."
    ],
    "Required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to establish a DTLS connection with the vulnerable server or client, and control the content of the TLS packets sent to the peer.",
