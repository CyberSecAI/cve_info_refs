{
  "CVE-2012-2136": {
    "description": "It was found that the data_len parameter of the sock_alloc_send_pskb() function in the Linux kernel's networking implementation was not validated before use. A privileged guest user in a KVM guest could use this flaw to crash the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient validation of the `data_len` parameter in the `sock_alloc_send_pskb()` function, leading to a potential heap overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Heap overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A privileged guest user in a KVM environment could crash the host or potentially escalate their privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered within the kernel's networking stack when handling data of a user-controlled length.",
      "required_capabilities": "A privileged guest user in a KVM environment.",
        "more_info": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `data_len` parameter is not properly checked before allocating memory using `skb` structures, and that a user can control the size of this parameter."
