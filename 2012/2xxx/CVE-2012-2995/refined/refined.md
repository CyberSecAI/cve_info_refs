Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-2995:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security Suite is vulnerable to both persistent (stored) and non-persistent (reflected) XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of a logged-in user's session. This could lead to:
    - Data theft
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement
    - Other malicious activities within the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Persistent/Stored XSS:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing a script that is stored by the application. The injected script will then be executed when the stored data is rendered/displayed.
    - Example URL: `hxxps://127.0.0.1:8445/addRuleAttrWrsApproveUrl.imss?wrsApprovedURL=xssxss"><script>alert('XSS')</script>`
- **Non-persistent/Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL that injects script that is immediately reflected back to the user's browser.
    - Example URL: `hxxps://127.0.0.1/initUpdSchPage.imss?src="><script>alert('XSS')</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated and needs to craft a specific URL that contains malicious script code.
- The attacker would need to convince the user to access the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Trend Micro InterScan Messaging Security Suite Version 7.1-Build_Win32_1394.
- The vulnerability was reported by Tom Gregory.
- A related vulnerability, CVE-2012-2996, involves cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
