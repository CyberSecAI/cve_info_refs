  "CVE-2012-2660": {
    "description": "A security flaw was found in the way rubygem-actionpack, the web-flow and rendering framework putting the VC in MVC, performed SQL query generation based on the content of params hash. If a Ruby on Rails application used Rack to parse query parameters, those parameters were not sanitized for the presence of the 'nil' value and that application relied, when performing user authentication, certain params value not to be 'nil', a remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the authentication, leading to information disclosure and / or unauthorized access to the service.",
    "root_cause": "The rubygem-actionpack did not sanitize query parameters for nil values when generating SQL queries.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unsafe SQL query generation",
      "Bypassing nil check",
       "SQL Injection (indirect)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could bypass authentication leading to unauthorized access and information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a request that sends a nil value within a query parameter."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
