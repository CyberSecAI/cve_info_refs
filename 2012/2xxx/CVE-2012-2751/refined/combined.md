# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 128 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2013 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1525152.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=444414586251302&id=1525152.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=443859889660551&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     : #678529

Qualys Vulnerability & Malware Research Labs discovered a vulnerability in
ModSecurity, a security module for the Apache webserver. In situations where
both 'Content:Disposition: attachment' and 'Content-Type: multipart' were
present in HTTP headers, the vulernability could allow an attacker to bypass
policy and execute cross-site script (XSS) attacks through properly crafted
HTML documents.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.12-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.6-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.6-1.

In testing and unstable distribution, the source package has been renamed to
modsecurity-apache.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-security packages.

# ModSecurity and ModSecurity Core Rule Set Multipart Bypasses

June 15, 2012

During our research of web application firewall evasion issues, we uncovered a flaw in ModSecurity that may lead to complete bypass of the installed rules, in the cases when ModSecurity is deployed to protect the backends where impedance mismatch is not mitigated. Additionally, a separate flaw in ModSecurity CRS makes the content type checks ineffective, allowing for bypass attacks, when deployed to protect the backends where impedance mismatch is not mitigated.

[ModSecurity](http://www.modsecurity.org) is a popular and widely deployed open source web application firewall engine. By design, ModSecurity does not include any security logic. The recommended configuration contains only a couple of rules that are tightly coupled with the performance of the engine itself. A comprehensive set of rules for ModSecurity can be obtained from a separate project called [ModSecurity Core Rules](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category%3AOWASP_ModSecurity_Core_Rule_Set_Project).

One of the main goals of web application firewalls (WAFs) is to detect attacks against the web applications they are protecting. In the most commonly used deployment modes (e.g., when operating as a reverse proxy), a WAF will terminate the higher layers of the traffic stream (e.g., the HTTP protocol), but only inspect and pass-through the remainder of the data. In the latter case, WAFs are vulnerable to impedance mismatch issues, where they interpret traffic in one way and the backend application interprets it in another way. When an impedance mismatch issue exists, the WAF may be vulnerable to evasion attacks.

Impedance mismatch issues are possibly the most difficult aspect of WAF implementation. In many cases, correct deployment requires not only correct implementation in the WAF, but correct configuration and handling of the reported problems by administrators. Our hope is that this short document, as well as our future research in this area, will shed some light onto this rarely discussed topic of WAF design. We would be delighted if this information is used to raise the effective security in real-life WAF deployments.

### Vulnerable versions

* Confirmed in ModSecurity 2.6.5; earlier versions likely to be vulnerable
* Confirmed in ModSecurity Core Rule Set 2.2.4; earlier versions likely to be vulnerable

Users are advised to upgrade to [ModSecurity 2.6.6](http://www.modsecurity.org/download/modsecurity-apache_2.6.6.tar.gz) and [ModSecurity Core Rule Set 2.2.5](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-security/files/modsecurity-crs/0-CURRENT/), which are thought to fix the issues documented here. Further, those who are not deploying the CRS should check that in their configuration they have rules that check REQBODY\_ERROR and MULTIPART\_STRICT\_ERROR, configured to block requests that have either of these flags set. For guidance on how to write such rules refer to the recommended default configuration file, which is included with ModSecurity.>

### Problem #1: Multipart bypass in ModSecurity with PHP in the backend

A mismatch between how multipart content is parsed in ModSecurity and PHP enables an attacker to perform a full rule set bypass.

PHP has a very lax multipart/form-data parser. Traditionally, securing ModSecurity against evasion in this parser is where a lot of development time was spent. In 2009, Stefan Esser published an evasion technique that relies on the use of single quotes—which are supported by PHP but were not supported by ModSecurity at the time—to trick ModSecurity into treating a request parameter as a file. This results in a bypass because ModSecurity uses separate mechanisms for the inspection of request parameter and file content, and files are often left uninspected.

This issue was addressed in November 2009 in ModSecurity 2.5.11, which started to accept single quotes for quoting. However, upon further examination of the PHP source code, we determined that the fix was not sufficient. PHP will not only allow a single quote to be used at the beginning of a string, but also at any other position within the string. ModSecurity, on the other hand, expects quote characters only at the first position. With some creativity, the impedance mismatch issue can be exploited to perform a bypass of the rules.

The issue was confirmed against PHP 5.4.3, but it's very likely that earlier versions can be used too. We are not releasing a proof of concept at this time, but the vulnerability is easy to exploit.

The users of ModSecurity CRS may be protected from this attack, depending on the exact deployment configuration. After the original issue had been reported, a defence-in-depth rule was added to CRS to detect side effects of a bypass attempt. This rule is effective when CRS is deployed in the traditional blocking mode, but not when anomaly scoring mode is used.

This issue should be addressed in ModSecurity's multipart parser. In addition, we recommend the following:

* Short term, improve the recommended default configuration to include the same defense in depth rule as the CRS.
* Long term, implement full request body rewriting. If the multipart payloads are fully rewritten according to how ModSecurity understands them, then any missed attack payloads will not be passed through to the backend. Such approach may require more processing, but we do not believe that this improvement would cause any practical performance issues because multipart content types are infrequent on average.

### Problem #2: Content type bypass in ModSecurity CRS with certain backends

When the ModSecurity CRS is used to protect certain permissive backend applications, supplying an invalid content type can be used for a complete bypass.

To address unknown content type bypass issues, ModSecurity CRS employs rules that allow only known content types to be used. However, these rules are not strict enough. By default, the CRS will check if the MIME type can be found within the following string (all one continuous line):

application/x-www-form-urlencoded multipart/form-data text/xml application/xml application/x-amf

This check will indeed reject many unknown and invalid MIME types, but it will also accept any substrings that can be found within the above string. In most cases, such invalid MIME types can be used only against a small number of applications. The only situation where this can be exploited is when attacking applications that expect only certain MIME types known to them (e.g., application/x-www-form-urlencoded) and don't check what actual MIME type is indicated in the Content-Type request header.

The attack was confirmed against [Apache Commons FileUpload 1.2.1](http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/), but earlier versions are equally likely to contribute to the bypass. Starting with the Servlet 3.0 specification, file uploads are supported natively, without the need to use a separate library. The Tomcat web server bundles the FileUpload library to implement file uploads, so even applications that do not explicitly use upload libraries may be vulnerable. The problem likely affects other web servers that are built on the Tomcat code base. Outside Java, at least one other server-side framework is thought to be vulnerable to the same problem.

The attack was confirmed against Apache Commons FileUpload 1.2.1, but earlier versions are equally likely to contribute to the bypass in this way.
