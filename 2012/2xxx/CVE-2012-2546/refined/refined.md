{
  "CVE-2012-2546": {
    "Root cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer's handling of event listeners. When an event listener object is deleted, but a reference to it is still held, accessing this freed memory can lead to memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control over the affected system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage that exploits the vulnerability via Internet Explorer. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious page, typically by clicking a link or opening an attachment.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and convince the user to visit it through social engineering or a similar method."
