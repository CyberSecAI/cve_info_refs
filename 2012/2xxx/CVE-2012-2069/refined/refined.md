Subject: CVE's for Drupal Contrib 2012 001 through 057 (67 new CVE assignments)

So I went through all the Drupal contrib modules for 2012, 4 already
have CVE's, 3 are not security issues/not clear ("may also have an sql
injection" isn't quite enough). The data is below in CSV format and
attached as a file since the line wraps are mangling it up. Data is in
the form:

"CVE(or note)",SA#","description","URL"
