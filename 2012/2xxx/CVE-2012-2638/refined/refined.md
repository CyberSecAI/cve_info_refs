Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is that SmallPICT, a bulletin-board software, does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically that the software does not sufficiently sanitize user input before displaying it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's web browser when they view the affected content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-Based Attacks:  The vulnerability can be exploited over the network using specially crafted packets.
- User Interaction:  Exploitation requires the victim to interact with the malicious content (e.g., clicking a link, or viewing a page containing the injected script).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No Authentication Required: An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- Internet Access: The attacker only needs to be able to send packets over the Internet to the affected system.
- Social Engineering: The attacker needs to convince the victim to interact with the malicious link or content, although this is deemed to be a "standard action that does not feel harmful to most users."

**CVSS Metrics (from JVNDB):**
- CVSS V2 Base Score: 4.3 (Medium)
  - Access Vector: Network
  - Access Complexity: Medium
  - Authentication: None
  - Confidentiality Impact: None
  - Integrity Impact: Partial
  - Availability Impact: None

**Affected Software:**
- SmallPICT version 2.6 and earlier.

**Additional Details:**
- The report was made to IPA by Yuji Tounai of bogus.jp.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as high for access required and lack of authentication, medium for the required user interaction, and high for the exploit complexity.
