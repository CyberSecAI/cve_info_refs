    "Source": "lists.opensuse.org_25a61dec_20250125_174332.html",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Denial of Service (via hash table collision) issue.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Java HashMap implementation was susceptible to predictable hash collisions. SBLIM uses HashMap when parsing XML inputs.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A specially-crafted CIM-XML message from a WBEM (Web-Based Enterprise Management) server could cause a SBLIM client to use an excessive amount of CPU, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted CIM-XML message from a WBEM server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted CIM-XML message to a vulnerable SBLIM client."
