Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-2089:

**Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the `ngx_http_mp4_module` of nginx. This module is used for pseudo-streaming MP4 files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to the overwriting of arbitrary memory locations within the nginx worker process.
- This can potentially result in arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves serving a specially crafted MP4 file to a client.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `ngx_http_mp4_module` processes this malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted MP4 file to a client that will be processed by a vulnerable nginx server using the `ngx_http_mp4_module`.
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger a request to a vulnerable server to serve the crafted file.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the server itself as the exploitation occurs on the worker process level.

**Additional Information:**
- The `ngx_http_mp4_module` is not enabled by default, so this vulnerability only affects servers where it is explicitly configured.
- The "mp4" directive must also be used in the configuration.
- The provided information mentions that worker processes are run under non-privileged user accounts, which may limit the scope of code execution.
- The vulnerability affects nginx versions between 1.1.3 and 1.1.18, and between 1.0.7 and 1.0.14 when built with the `ngx_http_mp4_module`.
- Patches are available to fix this issue.
