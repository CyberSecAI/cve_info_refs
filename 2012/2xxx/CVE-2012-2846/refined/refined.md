Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2012-2846:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Cross-process interference in renderers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability involves a cross-process interference issue within the rendering processes of Google Chrome. This suggests a lack of proper isolation or communication controls between renderers, potentially allowing one renderer to influence or access data from another improperly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact is rated as "Medium". While the specific consequences aren't detailed, cross-process interference could lead to various security issues, potentially including unauthorized access to data, manipulation of the rendering process, or unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the cross-process communication and isolation mechanisms within Chrome's rendering architecture. An attacker would need to find a way to make one renderer interfere with another.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the capability to execute code within a renderer process and then use that access to interfere with another renderer. The vulnerability is specific to Linux operating systems.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified by Julien Tinnes of the Google Chrome Security Team.
- The fix for this issue was included in Chrome version 21.0.1180.57 (for Mac and Linux), and 21.0.1180.60 (for Windows and Chrome Frame).
