Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-2321:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how ConnMan handles hostnames received via DHCP. Specifically, it does not properly check for shell escape sequences within the hostname string before setting it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The software fails to sanitize or validate the hostname received from a DHCP server, allowing malicious shell escape sequences.
- Command Injection: By injecting shell escape characters within the hostname, an attacker can cause the system to execute arbitrary shell commands when the hostname is processed by ConnMan.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the ConnMan process, which often runs with elevated privileges (root in many cases). This allows the attacker to gain full control over the affected system.
- Remote root exploit: The vulnerability is described as a "default remote root exploit" because ConnMan requests hostnames per DHCP by default.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious DHCP server: An attacker can set up a rogue DHCP server, or compromise a legitimate one, and configure it to provide a malicious hostname to the targeted system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the victim and be able to act as a DHCP server, or control an existing one that the target system uses.
- Ability to manipulate DHCP responses: The attacker must be capable of crafting DHCP responses with a malicious hostname.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as "quite high" in severity.
- This vulnerability allows for remote exploitation by default configurations.
- The issue is resolved with the patches [2a] and [2b] provided in the mailing list thread.

The provided information is consistent with the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-2321.
