| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=814278#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-04-19 14:18:10 UTC  ``` Currently we do not validate the vector length before calling get_user_pages_fast(), host stack could be easily overflowed by malicious guest driver who gives us a descriptors with length greater than MAX_SKB_FRAGS.  A privileged guest user could use this flaw to induce stack overflow on the host with attacker non-controlled data (some bits can be guessed, as it will be pointers to kernel memory) but with attacker controlled length.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0743)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A local, unprivileged user could use an integer overflow flaw in

drm\_mode\_dirtyfb\_ioctl() to cause a denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2012-0044, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the macvtap device driver, used for

creating a bridged network between the guest and the host in KVM
(Kernel-based Virtual Machine) environments. A privileged guest user in a
KVM guest could use this flaw to crash the host. Note: This issue only
affected hosts that have the vhost\_net module loaded with the
experimental\_zcopytx module option enabled (it is not enabled by default),
and that also have macvtap configured for at least one guest.
(CVE-2012-2119, Important)

* When a set user ID (setuid) application is executed, certain personality

flags for controlling the application's behavior are cleared (that is, a
privileged application will not be affected by those flags). It was found
that those flags were not cleared if the application was made privileged
via file system capabilities. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to change the behavior of such applications, allowing them to bypass
intended restrictions. Note that for default installations, no application
shipped by Red Hat for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is made privileged via file
system capabilities. (CVE-2012-2123, Important)

* It was found that the data\_len parameter of the sock\_alloc\_send\_pskb()

function in the Linux kernel's networking implementation was not validated
before use. A privileged guest user in a KVM guest could use this flaw to
crash the host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host.
(CVE-2012-2136, Important)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the setup\_routing\_entry() function in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel in the way the Message Signaled
Interrupts (MSI) routing entry was handled. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or, possibly, escalate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-2137, Important)

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's memory management

subsystem in the way pmd\_none\_or\_clear\_bad(), when called with mmap\_sem in
read mode, and Transparent Huge Pages (THP) page faults interacted. A
privileged user in a KVM guest with the ballooning functionality enabled
could potentially use this flaw to crash the host. A local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to crash the system. (CVE-2012-1179, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way device memory was handled during guest device

removal. Upon successful device removal, memory used by the device was not
properly unmapped from the corresponding IOMMU or properly released from
the kernel, leading to a memory leak. A malicious user on a KVM host who
has the ability to assign a device to a guest could use this flaw to crash
the host. (CVE-2012-2121, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS)

protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2372, Moderate)

* A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's memory management

subsystem in the way pmd\_populate() and pte\_offset\_map\_lock() interacted on
32-bit x86 systems with more than 4GB of RAM. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2373, Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Chen Haogang for reporting CVE-2012-0044.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these changes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's KVM (kernel virtual machine).

An administrative user in the guest OS could leverage this flaw to cause a

denial of service in the host OS. ([CVE-2012-2121](/security/CVE-2012-2121))

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers

that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit

this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](/security/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel

implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially

use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel.

([CVE-2012-3430](/security/CVE-2012-3430))

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel's memory

subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a

denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-3511](/security/CVE-2012-3511))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=814149#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-04-19 10:10:47 UTC  ``` KVM uses memory slots to track and map guest regions of memory.  When device assignment is used, the pages backing these slots are pinned in memory using get_user_pages and mapped into the iommu.  The problem is that when a memory slot is destroyed the pages for the associated memory slot are neither unpinned nor unmapped from the iommu.  The problem is that those pages are now never unpinned and continue to have an increased reference count. This is therefore a potential page leak from the kvm kernel module.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, local user with ability to assign device (with access to PCI sysfs files for a device) could use this flaw to DoS the system.  With upstream qemu-kvm/kvm privileged guest user that could hotunplug and then hotplug back certain devices could potentially use this flaw to DoS the host.

KVM: unmap pages from the iommu when slots are removed

commit [32f6daa](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/32f6daad4651a748a58a3ab6da0611862175722f) upstream.

We've been adding new mappings, but not destroying old mappings.
This can lead to a page leak as pages are pinned using
get_user_pages, but only unpinned with put_page if they still
exist in the memslots list on vm shutdown.  A memslot that is
destroyed while an iommu domain is enabled for the guest will
therefore result in an elevated page reference count that is
never cleared.

Additionally, without this fix, the iommu is only programmed
with the first translation for a gpa.  This can result in
peer-to-peer errors if a mapping is destroyed and replaced by a
new mapping at the same gpa as the iommu will still be pointing
to the original, pinned memory address.

# USN-2037-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

3 December 2013

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's KVM (kernel virtual machine).

An administrative user in the guest OS could leverage this flaw to cause a

denial of service in the host OS. ([CVE-2012-2121](/security/CVE-2012-2121))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-359-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-359.72](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-359.72)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0676)

## Topic

Updated kvm packages that fix two security issues and one bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

A flaw was found in the way the KVM\_CREATE\_IRQCHIP ioctl was handled.
Calling this ioctl when at least one virtual CPU (VCPU) already existed
could lead to a NULL pointer dereference later when the VCPU is scheduled
to run. A malicious user in the kvm group on the host could use this flaw
to crash the host. (CVE-2012-1601)

A flaw was found in the way device memory was handled during guest device
removal. Upon successful device removal, memory used by the device was not
properly unmapped from the corresponding IOMMU or properly released from
the kernel, leading to a memory leak. A malicious user in the kvm group on
the host who has the ability to assign a device to a guest could use this
flaw to crash the host. (CVE-2012-2121)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* An off-by-one error in the QEMU guest's memory management could, in rare

cases, cause QEMU-KVM to crash due to a segmentation fault in
tb\_invalidate\_phys\_page\_range() if a device initiated DMA into a specific
guest address. In a reported case, this issue presented on a system that
had a guest using the 8139cp network driver. (BZ#816207)

All users of kvm are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. Note that the procedure
in the Solution section must be performed before this update will take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

The following procedure must be performed before this update will take
effect:

1) Stop all KVM guest virtual machines.

2) Either reboot the hypervisor machine or, as the root user, remove (using
"modprobe -r [module]") and reload (using "modprobe [module]") all of the
following modules which are currently running (determined using "lsmod"):
kvm, ksm, kvm-intel or kvm-amd.

3) Restart the KVM guest virtual machines.

tcp: avoid order-1 allocations on wifi and tx path
[ This combines upstream commit
a21d45726acacc963d8baddf74607d9b74e2b723 and the follow-on bug fix
commit a21d45726acacc963d8baddf74607d9b74e2b723 ]
Marc Merlin reported many order-1 allocations failures in TX path on its
wireless setup, that dont make any sense with MTU=1500 network, and non
SG capable hardware.
After investigation, it turns out TCP uses sk\_stream\_alloc\_skb() and
used as a convention skb\_tailroom(skb) to know how many bytes of data
payload could be put in this skb (for non SG capable devices)
Note : these skb used kmalloc-4096 (MTU=1500 + MAX\_HEADER +
sizeof(struct skb\_shared\_info) being above 2048)
Later, mac80211 layer need to add some bytes at the tail of skb
(IEEE80211\_ENCRYPT\_TAILROOM = 18 bytes) and since no more tailroom is
available has to call pskb\_expand\_head() and request order-1
allocations.
This patch changes sk\_stream\_alloc\_skb() so that only
sk->sk\_prot->max\_header bytes of headroom are reserved, and use a new
skb field, avail\_size to hold the data payload limit.
This way, order-0 allocations done by TCP stack can leave more than 2 KB
of tailroom and no more allocation is performed in mac80211 layer (or
any layer needing some tailroom)
avail\_size is unioned with mark/dropcount, since mark will be set later
in IP stack for output packets. Therefore, skb size is unchanged.

net: allow pskb\_expand\_head() to get maximum tailroom
[ Upstream commit 87151b8689d890dfb495081f7be9b9e257f7a2df ]
Marc Merlin reported many order-1 allocations failures in TX path on its
wireless setup, that dont make any sense with MTU=1500 network, and non
SG capable hardware.
Turns out part of the problem comes from pskb\_expand\_head() not using
ksize() to get exact head size given by kmalloc(). Doing the same thing
than \_\_alloc\_skb() allows more tailroom in skb and can prevent future
reallocations.
As a bonus, struct skb\_shared\_info becomes cache line aligned.

child sockets would be incorrect. This commit mirrors the advmss logic
from tcp\_v4\_syn\_recv\_sock in tcp\_v6\_syn\_recv\_sock. Eventually this
logic should probably be shared between IPv4 and IPv6, but this at
least fixes this issue.

net ax25: Reorder ax25\_exit to remove races.
[ Upstream commit 3adadc08cc1e2cbcc15a640d639297ef5fcb17f5 ]
While reviewing the sysctl code in ax25 I spotted races in ax25\_exit
where it is possible to receive notifications and packets after already
freeing up some of the data structures needed to process those
notifications and updates.
Call unregister\_netdevice\_notifier early so that the rest of the cleanup
code does not need to deal with network devices. This takes advantage
of my recent enhancement to unregister\_netdevice\_notifier to send
unregister notifications of all network devices that are current
registered.
Move the unregistration for packet types, socket types and protocol
types before we cleanup any of the ax25 data structures to remove the
possibilities of other races.

net\_sched: gred: Fix oops in gred\_dump() in WRED mode
[ Upstream commit 244b65dbfede788f2fa3fe2463c44d0809e97c6b ]
A parameter set exists for WRED mode, called wred\_set, to hold the same
values for qavg and qidlestart across all VQs. The WRED mode values had
been previously held in the VQ for the default DP. After these values
were moved to wred\_set, the VQ for the default DP was no longer created
automatically (so that it could be omitted on purpose, to have packets
in the default DP enqueued directly to the device without using RED).
However, gred\_dump() was overlooked during that change; in WRED mode it
still reads qavg/qidlestart from the VQ for the default DP, which might
not even exist. As a result, this command sequence will cause an oops:
tc qdisc add dev $DEV handle $HANDLE parent $PARENT gred setup \
DPs 3 default 2 grio
tc qdisc change dev $DEV handle $HANDLE gred DP 0 prio 8 $RED\_OPTIONS
tc qdisc change dev $DEV handle $HANDLE gred DP 1 prio 8 $RED\_OPTIONS
This fixes gred\_dump() in WRED mode to use the values held in wred\_set.

net/ethernet: ks8851\_mll fix rx frame buffer overflow
[ Upstream commit 8a9a0ea6032186e3030419262678d652b88bf6a8 ]
At the beginning of ks\_rcv(), a for loop retrieves the
header information relevant to all the frames stored
in the mac's internal buffers. The number of pending
frames is stored as an 8 bits field in KS\_RXFCTR.
If interrupts are disabled long enough to allow for more than
32 frames to accumulate in the MAC's internal buffers, a buffer
overflow occurs.
This patch fixes the problem by making the
driver's frame\_head\_info buffer big enough.
Well actually, since the chip appears to have 12K of
internal rx buffers and the shortest ethernet frame should
be 64 bytes long, maybe the limit could be set to
12\*1024/64 = 192 frames, but 255 should be safer.

tcp: fix tcp\_rcv\_rtt\_update() use of an unscaled RTT sample
[ Upstream commit 18a223e0b9ec8979320ba364b47c9772391d6d05 ]
Fix a code path in tcp\_rcv\_rtt\_update() that was comparing scaled and
unscaled RTT samples.
The intent in the code was to only use the 'm' measurement if it was a
new minimum. However, since 'm' had not yet been shifted left 3 bits
but 'new\_sample' had, this comparison would nearly always succeed,
leading us to erroneously set our receive-side RTT estimate to the 'm'
sample when that sample could be nearly 8x too high to use.
The overall effect is to often cause the receive-side RTT estimate to
be significantly too large (up to 40% too large for brief periods in
my tests).

As it stands the bridge IGMP snooping system will respond to

This is both unnecessary and undesirable. First of all any
multicast routers present should be doing this rather than us.
What's more the queries that we send may end up upsetting other
multicast snooping swithces in the system that are buggy.
In fact, we can simply remove the code that send these queries
because the existing membership expiry mechanism doesn't rely
on them anyway.

sctp: Allow struct sctp\_event\_subscribe to grow without breaking binaries
[ Upstream commit acdd5985364f8dc511a0762fab2e683f29d9d692 ]
getsockopt(..., SCTP\_EVENTS, ...) performs a length check and returns
an error if the user provides less bytes than the size of struct
sctp\_event\_subscribe.
Struct sctp\_event\_subscribe needs to be extended by an u8 for every
new event or notification type that is added.
This obviously makes getsockopt fail for binaries that are compiled
against an older versions of  which do not contain
all event types.
This patch changes getsockopt behaviour to no longer return an error
if not enough bytes are being provided by the user. Instead, it
returns as much of sctp\_event\_subscribe as fits into the provided buffer.
This leads to the new behavior that users see what they have been aware
of at compile time.
The setsockopt(..., SCTP\_EVENTS, ...) API is already behaving like this.

tcp: allow splice() to build full TSO packets
[ This combines upstream commit
2f53384424251c06038ae612e56231b96ab610ee and the follow-on bug fix
commit 35f9c09fe9c72eb8ca2b8e89a593e1c151f28fc2 ]
vmsplice()/splice(pipe, socket) call do\_tcp\_sendpages() one page at a
time, adding at most 4096 bytes to an skb. (assuming PAGE\_SIZE=4096)
The call to tcp\_push() at the end of do\_tcp\_sendpages() forces an
immediate xmit when pipe is not already filled, and tso\_fragment() try
to split these skb to MSS multiples.
4096 bytes are usually split in a skb with 2 MSS, and a remaining
sub-mss skb (assuming MTU=1500)
This makes slow start suboptimal because many small frames are sent to
qdisc/driver layers instead of big ones (constrained by cwnd and packets
in flight of course)
In fact, applications using sendmsg() (adding an additional memory copy)
instead of vmsplice()/splice()/sendfile() are a bit faster because of
this anomaly, especially if serving small files in environments with
large initial [c]wnd.
Call tcp\_push() only if MSG\_MORE is not set in the flags parameter.
This bit is automatically provided by splice() internals but for the
last page, or on all pages if user specified SPLICE\_F\_MORE splice()
flag.
In some workloads, this can reduce number of sent logical packets by an
order of magnitude, making zero-copy TCP actually faster than
one-copy :)

ppp: Don't stop and restart queue on every TX packet
[ This combines upstream commit
e675f0cc9a872fd152edc0c77acfed19bf28b81e and follow-on bug fix
commit 9a5d2bd99e0dfe9a31b3c160073ac445ba3d773f ]
For every transmitted packet, ppp\_start\_xmit() will stop the netdev
queue and then, if appropriate, restart it. This causes the TX softirq
to run, entirely gratuitously.
This is "only" a waste of CPU time in the normal case, but it's actively
harmful when the PPP device is a TEQL slave — the wakeup will cause the
offending device to receive the next TX packet from the TEQL queue, when
it \*should\* have gone to the next slave in the list. We end up seeing
large bursts of packets on just \*one\* slave device, rather than using
the full available bandwidth over all slaves.
This patch fixes the problem by \*not\* unconditionally stopping the queue
in ppp\_start\_xmit(). It adds a return value from ppp\_xmit\_process()
which indicates whether the queue should be stopped or not.
It \*doesn't\* remove the call to netif\_wake\_queue() from
ppp\_xmit\_process(), because other code paths (especially from
ppp\_output\_wakeup()) need it there and it's messy to push it out to the
other callers to do it based on the return value. So we leave it in
place — it's a no-op in the case where the queue wasn't stopped, so it's
harmless in the TX path.

net: fix /proc/net/dev regression
[ Upstream commit 2def16ae6b0c77571200f18ba4be049b03d75579 ]
Commit f04565ddf52 (dev: use name hash for dev\_seq\_ops) added a second
regression, as some devices are missing from /proc/net/dev if many
devices are defined.
When seq\_file buffer is filled, the last ->next/show() method is
canceled (pos value is reverted to value prior ->next() call)
Problem is after above commit, we dont restart the lookup at right
position in ->start() method.
Fix this by removing the internal 'pos' pointer added in commit, since
we need to use the 'loff\_t \*pos' provided by seq\_file layer.
This also reverts commit 5cac98dd0 (net: Fix corruption
in /proc/\*/net/dev\_mcast), since its not needed anymore.

KVM: unmap pages from the iommu when slots are removed
commit 32f6daad4651a748a58a3ab6da0611862175722f upstream.
We've been adding new mappings, but not destroying old mappings.
This can lead to a page leak as pages are pinned using
get\_user\_pages, but only unpinned with put\_page if they still
exist in the memslots list on vm shutdown. A memslot that is
destroyed while an iommu domain is enabled for the guest will
therefore result in an elevated page reference count that is
never cleared.
Additionally, without this fix, the iommu is only programmed
with the first translation for a gpa. This can result in
peer-to-peer errors if a mapping is destroyed and replaced by a
new mapping at the same gpa as the iommu will still be pointing
to the original, pinned memory address.

PCI: Add quirk for still enabled interrupts on Intel Sandy Bridge GPUs
commit f67fd55fa96f7d7295b43ffbc4a97d8f55e473aa upstream.
Some BIOS implementations leave the Intel GPU interrupts enabled,
even though no one is handling them (f.e. i915 driver is never loaded).
Additionally the interrupt destination is not set up properly
and the interrupt ends up -somewhere-.
These spurious interrupts are "sticky" and the kernel disables
the (shared) interrupt line after 100.000+ generated interrupts.
Fix it by disabling the still enabled interrupts.
This resolves crashes often seen on monitor unplug.
Tested on the following boards:
- Intel DH61CR: Affected
- Intel DH67BL: Affected
- Intel S1200KP server board: Affected
- Asus P8H61-M LE: Affected, but system does not crash.
Probably the IRQ ends up somewhere unnoticed.
According to reports on the net, the Intel DH61WW board is also affected.

with the register configuration and to Intel in general

USB: fix deadlock in bConfigurationValue attribute method
commit 8963c487a80b4688c9e68dcc504a90074aacc145 upstream.
This patch (as154) fixes a self-deadlock that occurs when userspace
writes to the bConfigurationValue sysfs attribute for a hub with
children. The task tries to lock the bandwidth\_mutex at a time when
it already owns the lock:
The attribute's method calls usb\_set\_configuration(),
which calls usb\_disable\_device() with the bandwidth\_mutex
held.
usb\_disable\_device() unregisters the existing interfaces,
which causes the hub driver to be unbound.
The hub\_disconnect() routine calls hub\_quiesce(), which
calls usb\_disconnect() for each of the hub's children.
usb\_disconnect() attempts to acquire the bandwidth\_mutex
around a call to usb\_disable\_device().
The solution is to make usb\_disable\_device() acquire the mutex for
itself instead of requiring the caller to hold it. Then the mutex can
cover only the bandwidth deallocation operation and not the region
where the interfaces are unregistered.
This has the potential to change system behavior slightly when a
config change races with another config or altsetting change. Some of
the bandwidth released from the old config might get claimed by the
other config or altsetting, make it impossible to restore the old
config in case of a failure. But since we don't try to recover from
config-change failures anyway, this doesn't matter.
[This should be marked for stable kernels that contain the commit
fccf4e86200b8f5edd9a65da26f150e32ba79808 "USB: Free bandwidth when
usb\_disable\_device is called."

They can generate interrupts whenever the STS\_FLR status bit is turned

Since the driver doesn't use STS\_FLR anyway, the patch changes the
interrupt routine to clear that bit whenever it is set, rather than
leaving it alone.

EHCI: fix criterion for resuming the root hub
commit dc75ce9d929aabeb0843a6b1a4ab320e58ba1597 upstream.
This patch (as1542) changes the criterion ehci-hcd uses to tell when
it needs to resume the controller's root hub. A resume is needed when
a port status change is detected, obviously, but only if the root hub
is currently suspended.
Right now the driver tests whether the root hub is running, and that
is not the correct test. In particular, if the controller has died
then the root hub should not be restarted. In addition, some buggy
hardware occasionally requires the root hub to be running and
sending out SOF packets even while it is nominally supposed to be
suspended.
In the end, the test needs to be changed. Rather than checking whether
the root hub is currently running, the driver will now check whether
the root hub is currently suspended. This will yield the correct
behavior in all cases.

pch\_uart: Fix dma channel unallocated issue
commit af6d17cdc8c89aeb3101f0d27cd32fc0592b40b2 upstream.
This driver anticipates pch\_uart\_verify\_port() is not called
during installation.
However, actually pch\_uart\_verify\_port() is called during
installation.
As a result, memory access violation occurs like below.
0. initial value: use\_dma=0
1. starup()
- dma channel is not allocated because use\_dma=0
2. pch\_uart\_verify\_port()
- Set use\_dma=1
3. UART processing acts DMA mode because use\_dma=1
- memory access violation occurs!
This patch fixes the issue.
Solution:
Whenever pch\_uart\_verify\_port() is called and then
dma channel is not allocated, the channel should be allocated.

commit c744a65c1e2d59acc54333ce8
md: don't set md arrays to readonly on shutdown.
removed the possibility of a 'BUG' when data is written to an array
that has just been switched to read-only, but also introduced the
possibility that the array metadata could be corrupted.
If, when md\_notify\_reboot gets the mddev lock, the array is
in a state where it is assembled but hasn't been started (as can
happen if the personality module is not available, or in other unusual
situations), then incorrect metadata will be written out making it
impossible to re-assemble the array.
So only call \_\_md\_stop\_writes() if the array has actually been
activated.
This patch is needed for any stable kernel which has had the above
commit applied.

cause md\_check\_recovery to call ->add\_disk much more often.
Instead of only when the array is degraded, it is now called whenever
md\_check\_recovery finds anything useful to do, which includes
updating the metadata for clean<->dirty transition.
This causes unnecessary work, and causes info messages from ->add\_disk
to be reported much too often.
So refine md\_check\_recovery to only do any actual recovery checking

mm: fix s390 BUG by \_\_set\_page\_dirty\_no\_writeback on swap
commit aca50bd3b4c4bb5528a1878158ba7abce41de534 upstream.
Mel reports a BUG\_ON(slot == NULL) in radix\_tree\_tag\_set() on s390
3.0.13: called from \_\_set\_page\_dirty\_nobuffers() when page\_remove\_rmap()
tries to transfer dirty flag from s390 storage key to struct page and
radix\_tree.
That would be because of reclaim's shrink\_page\_list() calling
add\_to\_swap() on this page at the same time: first PageSwapCache is set
(causing page\_mapping(page) to appear as &swapper\_space), then
page->private set, then tree\_lock taken, then page inserted into
radix\_tree - so there's an interval before taking the lock when the
radix\_tree slot is empty.
We could fix this by moving \_\_add\_to\_swap\_cache()'s spin\_lock\_irq up
before the SetPageSwapCache. But a better fix is simply to do what's
five years overdue: Ken Chen introduced \_\_set\_page\_dirty\_no\_writeback()
(if !PageDirty TestSetPageDirty) for tmpfs to skip all the radix\_tree
overhead, and swap is just the same - it ignores the radix\_tree tag, and
does not participate in dirty page accounting, so should be using
\_\_set\_page\_dirty\_no\_writeback() too.
s390 testing now confirms that this does indeed fix the problem.

Fix modpost failures in fedora 17

The symbol table on x86-64 starts to have entries that have names
like:
\_GLOBAL\_\_sub\_I\_65535\_0\_\_\_mod\_x86cpu\_device\_table
They are of type STT\_FUNCTION and this one had a length of 18. This
matched the device ID validation logic and it barfed because the
length did not meet the device type's criteria.
--------------------
FATAL: arch/x86/crypto/aesni-intel: sizeof(struct x86cpu\_device\_id)=16 is not a modulo of the size of section \_\_mod\_x86cpu\_device\_table=18.
Fix definition of struct x86cpu\_device\_id in mod\_devicetable.h
--------------------

not something we want to inspect in modpost's device ID table

doesn't know anything about delivery systems.
However, as, by accident, this used to work, we need to restore its
behavior, in order to avoid regressions with those softwares.

To reproduce this bug, flood ping the device, e.g., ping -f -l 1000

xen/xenbus: Add quirk to deal with misconfigured backends.
commit 3066616ce23aad5719c23a0f21f32676402cb44b upstream.
A rather annoying and common case is when booting a PVonHVM guest
and exposing the PV KBD and PV VFB - as broken toolstacks don't
always initialize the backends correctly.
Normally The HVM guest is using the VGA driver and the emulated
keyboard for this (though upstream version of QEMU implements
PV KBD, but still uses a VGA driver). We provide a very basic
two-stage wait mechanism - where we wait for 30 seconds for all
devices, and then for 270 for all them except the two mentioned.
That allows us to wait for the essential devices, like network
or disk for the full 6 minutes.
To trigger this, put this in your guest config:
vfb = [ 'vnc=1, vnclisten=0.0.0.0 ,vncunused=1']
instead of this:
vnc=1
vnclisten="0.0.0.0"

mmc: sdhci: refine non-removable card checking for card detection
commit 87b87a3fc0eec58d95e4216392f889a26439ad22 upstream.
Commit c79396c191bc19 ("mmc: sdhci: prevent card detection activity
for non-removable cards") disables card detection where the cards
are marked as non-removable.
This makes sense, but the implementation detail of calling
mmc\_card\_is\_removable() causes some problems, because
mmc\_card\_is\_removable() is overloaded with CONFIG\_MMC\_UNSAFE\_RESUME
semantics.
In the OLPC XO case, we need CONFIG\_MMC\_UNSAFE\_RESUME because our root
filesystem is stored on SD, but we also have external SD card slots
where we want automatic card detection.
Refine the check to only apply to hosts marked as MMC\_CAP\_NONREMOVABLE,
which is defined to mean that the card is \*really\* nonremovable. This
could be revisited in future if we find a way to improve
CONFIG\_MMC\_UNSAFE\_RESUME semantics.

commit 7194efb8f063ee3aa0cb50d9002348887e68ec10 upstream.
eMMC v4.5 discard operation is significantly different from the
existing trim operation because it is not guaranteed to work with
the new sanitize operation. Consequently mmc\_can\_trim() is
separated from mmc\_can\_discard().
Also the new discard operation does not result in the sectors being
set to all-zeros, so discard\_zeroes\_data must not be set.
In addition, the new discard has the same timeout as trim, but from
v4.5 trim is defined to use the hc timeout. The timeout calculation
is adjusted accordingly.

addresses, but those functions take virtual addresses.
sparse caught this:
arch/arm/mach-omap1/timer.c:50:13: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different base types)
arch/arm/mach-omap1/timer.c:50:13: expected void const volatile [noderef] \*
arch/arm/mach-omap1/timer.c:50:13: got unsigned int
arch/arm/mach-omap1/timer.c:52:9: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different base types)
arch/arm/mach-omap1/timer.c:52:9: expected void const volatile [noderef] \*
arch/arm/mach-omap1/timer.c:52:9: got unsigned int
Fix by using omap\_{read,writel}(), just like the other users of the
MOD\_CONF\_CTRL\_1 register in the OMAP1 codebase. Of course, in the long term,
removing omap\_{read,write}l() is the appropriate thing to do; but
this will take some work to do this cleanly.
Looks like this was caused by 97933d6 (ARM: OMAP1: dmtimer: conversion
to platform devices) that dangerously moved code and changed it in
the same patch.

memblock: memblock should be able to handle zero length operations
commit b3dc627cabb33fc95f93da78457770c1b2a364d2 upstream.
Commit 24aa07882b ("memblock, x86: Replace memblock\_x86\_reserve/
free\_range() with generic ones") replaced x86 specific memblock
operations with the generic ones; unfortunately, it lost zero length
operation handling in the process making the kernel panic if somebody
tries to reserve zero length area.
There isn't much to be gained by being cranky to zero length operations
and panicking is almost the worst response. Drop the BUG\_ON() in
memblock\_reserve() and update memblock\_add\_region/isolate\_range() so
that all zero length operations are handled as noops.

ALSA: hda/conexant - Set up the missing docking-station pins
commit d70f363222ef373c2037412f09a600357cfa1c7a upstream.
ThinkPad 410,420,510,520 and X201 with cx50585 & co chips have the
docking-station ports, but BIOS doesn't initialize for these pins.
Thus, like the former X200, we need to set up the pins manually in the
driver.
The odd part is that the same PCI SSID is used for X200 and T400, thus
we need to prepare individual fixup tables for cx5051 and others.

[Patch not needed upstream as this is a backport build bugfix - gregkh
gcc correctly complains:
util/hist.c: In function ‘\_\_hists\_\_add\_entry’:
util/hist.c:240:27: error: invalid type argument of ‘->’ (have ‘struct hist\_entry’)
util/hist.c:241:23: error: invalid type argument of ‘->’ (have ‘struct hist\_entry’)
for this new code:
+ if (he->ms.map != entry->ms.map) {
+ he->ms.map = entry->ms.map;
+ if (he->ms.map)
+ he->ms.map->referenced = true;
+ }
because "entry" is a "struct hist\_entry", not a pointer to a struct.
In mainline, "entry" is a pointer to struct passed as argument to the function.
So this is broken during backporting. But obviously not compile tested.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=814149#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-04-19 10:10:47 UTC  ``` KVM uses memory slots to track and map guest regions of memory.  When device assignment is used, the pages backing these slots are pinned in memory using get_user_pages and mapped into the iommu.  The problem is that when a memory slot is destroyed the pages for the associated memory slot are neither unpinned nor unmapped from the iommu.  The problem is that those pages are now never unpinned and continue to have an increased reference count. This is therefore a potential page leak from the kvm kernel module.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, local user with ability to assign device (with access to PCI sysfs files for a device) could use this flaw to DoS the system.  With upstream qemu-kvm/kvm privileged guest user that could hotunplug and then hotplug back certain devices could potentially use this flaw to DoS the host.

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's KVM (kernel virtual machine).

An administrative user in the guest OS could leverage this flaw to cause a

denial of service in the host OS. ([CVE-2012-2121](/security/CVE-2012-2121))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame-

buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could

exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](/security/CVE-2013-4511))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
