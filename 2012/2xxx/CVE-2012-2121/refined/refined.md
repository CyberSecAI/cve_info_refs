  "CVE-2012-2121": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way device memory was handled during guest device removal. Upon successful device removal, memory used by the device was not properly unmapped from the corresponding IOMMU or properly released from the kernel, leading to a memory leak. A malicious user on a KVM host who has the ability to assign a device to a guest could use this flaw to crash the host.",
    "root_cause": "Improper unmapping and release of memory associated with a device after device removal.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak",
      "Incomplete resource cleanup"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (host crash) due to memory exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious user on a KVM host who has the ability to assign a device to a guest can trigger this vulnerability by repeatedly assigning and deassigning devices."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to assign a device to a guest on a KVM host (requires privileges on the host system)"
    ],
     "additional_details": [
        "The vulnerability occurs in the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel.",
        "Memory slots used for tracking and mapping guest memory regions are not properly unmapped from IOMMU or released from kernel memory upon device removal.",
        "Privileged guest user could trigger the issue by hot-unplugging and then hot-plugging back certain devices."
