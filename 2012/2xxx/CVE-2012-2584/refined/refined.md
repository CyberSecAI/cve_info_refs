{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-supplied data within the body of an email, specifically when viewed through the Alt-N MDaemon webmail interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize or encode the email body, allowing malicious HTML and JavaScript to be injected.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of the victim's browser when they view the email. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted emails containing malicious HTML/JavaScript payloads. These emails are then delivered to the target mail server and viewed via the web interface.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send an email to a user of the vulnerable MDaemon server. They do not require any specific position on the network, only access to send email."
