Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Intuit QuickBooks:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Intuit QuickBooks handles the `intu-help-qb` protocol. This custom protocol can be triggered by malicious HTML and Javascript. Specifically, there are two distinct vulnerabilities:

1.  **File Retrieval:** The `intu-help-qb` protocol allows an attacker to retrieve files from a ZIP archive that the user has access to.
2.  **Heap Corruption and Memory Leak:** The same protocol can be exploited to cause heap corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **File Disclosure:** The ability to retrieve files from ZIP archives via the `intu-help-qb` protocol without proper access controls is a file disclosure vulnerability.
2.  **Heap Corruption:** The `intu-help-qb` protocol, when improperly handled, causes memory corruption, specifically heap corruption, which can be further exploited.
3. **Memory Leak:** The `intu-help-qb` protocol leads to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive files from ZIP archives that the user has access to if the attacker knows or can guess the path and filename of the target ZIP and file inside of it. This is limited to files that are not in subdirectories within the archive.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting the heap corruption vulnerability can enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Malicious HTML and/or JavaScript can be used to trigger the vulnerable `intu-help-qb` protocol. This can be delivered to the victim through various means (e.g. malicious websites, phishing emails with crafted HTML).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **For File Retrieval:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path and filename of the target ZIP archive on the victim's local or network file system, as well as the name of the target file within the ZIP. However, this attack vector is limited to files within the root of the ZIP archive.
*   **For Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious HTML or JavaScript to the user. They would not necessarily need the same level of access to file paths for the user.
*  The user must be using an affected version of Intuit QuickBooks (2009-2012)
