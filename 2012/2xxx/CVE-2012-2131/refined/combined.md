  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0990 : Ward van Wanrooij

* **Note**: Starting with OS X v10.8.4, Java Web Start (i.e., JNLP) applications downloaded from the Internet need to be signed with a Developer ID certificate. Gatekeeper will check downloaded Java Web Start applications for a signature and block such applications from launching if they are not properly signed.

  You can use the codesign utility to sign the JNLP file, which will attach the code signature to the JNLP file as extended attributes. To preserve these attributes, package the JNLP file in a ZIP, XIP, or DMG file. Be careful using the ZIP format, as some third-party tools might not capture the required extended attributes correctly.

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2012-0884

	Ivan Nestlerode discovered a weakness in the CMS and PKCS #7
	implementations that could allow an attacker to decrypt data
	via a Million Message Attack (MMA).

CVE-2012-1165

	It was discovered that a NULL pointer could be dereferenced
	when parsing certain S/MIME messages, leading to denial of
	service.

CVE-2012-2110

	Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team, discovered a vulnerability
	in the way DER-encoded ASN.1 data is parsed that can result in
	a heap overflow.

Additionally, the fix for CVE-2011-4619 has been updated to address an
issue with SGC handshakes.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze11.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1a-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

If you test your 0.9.x updates with this reproducer from Tavis, you
should still expect to see crashes, which are now corrected upstream in
0.9.8w:

<http://marc.info/?l=openssl-dev&m=133525318514423&w=2>

This incomplete fix got CVE-2012-2131.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on

# USN-1428-1: OpenSSL vulnerability

24 April 2012

An application using OpenSSL could be made to crash or run programs if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [openssl](/security/cves?package=openssl) - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic library and tools

## Details

It was discovered that the fix for [CVE-2012-2110](/security/CVE-2012-2110) was incomplete for OpenSSL

0.9.8. A remote attacker could trigger this flaw in services that used SSL

to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with

application privileges. Ubuntu 11.10 was not affected by this issue.

([CVE-2012-2131](/security/CVE-2012-2131))

The original upstream fix for [CVE-2012-2110](/security/CVE-2012-2110) would cause BUF\_MEM\_grow\_clean()

to sometimes return the wrong error condition. This update fixes the

problem.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.18)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [1.0.0e-2ubuntu4.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/1.0.0e-2ubuntu4.5)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [0.9.8o-5ubuntu1.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/0.9.8o-5ubuntu1.5)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl)
  -
  [0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openssl/0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.11)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
