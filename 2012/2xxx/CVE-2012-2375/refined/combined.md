# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Fix length of buffer copied in \_\_nfs4\_get\_acl\_uncached

```
_copy_from_pages() used to copy data from the temporary buffer to the
user passed buffer is passed the wrong size parameter when copying
data. res.acl_len contains both the bitmap and acl lenghts while
acl_len contains the acl length after adjusting for the bitmap size.

cred: copy\_process() should clear child->replacement\_session\_keyring
commit 79549c6dfda0603dba9a70a53467ce62d9335c33 upstream.
keyctl\_session\_to\_parent(task) sets ->replacement\_session\_keyring,
it should be processed and cleared by key\_replace\_session\_keyring().
However, this task can fork before it notices TIF\_NOTIFY\_RESUME and
the new child gets the bogus ->replacement\_session\_keyring copied by
dup\_task\_struct(). This is obviously wrong and, if nothing else, this
leads to put\_cred(already\_freed\_cred).
change copy\_creds() to clear this member. If copy\_process() fails
before this point the wrong ->replacement\_session\_keyring doesn't
matter, exit\_creds() won't be called.

media: dvb\_frontend: regression fix: userspace ABI broken for xine
commit 556a0442e08a8bc8541587a349cbf26ed14ec6de upstream.
The commit e399ce77e6e has broken the DVB ABI for xine:
The problem is that xine is expecting every event after a successful
FE\_SET\_FRONTEND ioctl to have a non-zero frequency parameter, regardless
of whether the tuning process has LOCKed yet. What used to happen is
that the events inherited the initial tuning parameters from the
FE\_SET\_FRONTEND call. However, the fepriv->parameters\_out struct is now
not initialised until the status contains the FE\_HAS\_LOCK bit.
You might argue that this behaviour is intentional, except that if an
application other than xine uses the DVB adapter and manages to set the
parameters\_out.frequency field to something other than zero, then xine
no longer has any problems until either the adapter is replugged or the
kernel modules reloaded. This can only mean that the
fepriv->parameters\_out struct still contains the (stale) tuning
information from the previous application.

uvcvideo: Fix race-related crash in uvc\_video\_clock\_update()
commit ed0ee0ce0a3224dab5caa088a5f8b6df25924276 upstream.
The driver frees the clock samples buffer before stopping the video
buffers queue. If a DQBUF call arrives in-between,
uvc\_video\_clock\_update() will be called with a NULL clock samples
buffer, leading to a crash. This occurs very frequently when using the
webcam with the flash browser plugin.
Move clock initialization/cleanup to uvc\_video\_enable() in order to free
the clock samples buffer after the queue is stopped. Make sure the clock
is reset at resume time to avoid miscalculating timestamps.

ioat: fix size of 'completion' for Xen
commit 275029353953c2117941ade84f02a2303912fad1 upstream.
Starting with v3.2 Jonathan reports that Xen crashes loading the ioatdma
driver. A debug run shows:
ioatdma 0000:00:16.4: desc[0]: (0x300cc7000->0x300cc7040) cookie: 0 flags: 0x2 ctl: 0x29 (op: 0 int\_en: 1 compl: 1)
...
ioatdma 0000:00:16.4: ioat\_get\_current\_completion: phys\_complete: 0xcc7000
...which shows that in this environment GFP\_KERNEL memory may be backed
by a 64-bit dma address. This breaks the driver's assumption that an
unsigned long should be able to contain the physical address for
descriptor memory. Switch to dma\_addr\_t which beyond being the right
size, is the true type for the data i.e. an io-virtual address
inidicating the engine's last processed descriptor.

mfd: Clear twl6030 IRQ status register only once
commit 3f8349e6e98ba0455437724589072523865eae5e upstream.
TWL6030 family of PMIC use a shadow interrupt status register
while kernel processes the current interrupt event.
However, any write(0 or 1) to register INT\_STS\_A, INT\_STS\_B or
INT\_STS\_C clears all 3 interrupt status registers.
Since clear of the interrupt is done on 32k clk, depending on I2C
bus speed, we could in-adverently clear the status of a interrupt
status pending on shadow register in the current implementation.
This is due to the fact that multi-byte i2c write operation into
three seperate status register could result in multiple load
and clear of status and result in lost interrupts.
Instead, doing a single byte write to INT\_STS\_A register with 0x0
will clear all three interrupt status registers without the related
risk.

sched/x86: Fix overflow in cyc2ns\_offset
commit 9993bc635d01a6ee7f6b833b4ee65ce7c06350b1 upstream.
When a machine boots up, the TSC generally gets reset. However,
when kexec is used to boot into a kernel, the TSC value would be
carried over from the previous kernel. The computation of
cycns\_offset in set\_cyc2ns\_scale is prone to an overflow, if the
machine has been up more than 208 days prior to the kexec. The
overflow happens when we multiply \*scale, even though there is
enough room to store the final answer.
We fix this issue by decomposing tsc\_now into the quotient and
remainder of division by CYC2NS\_SCALE\_FACTOR and then performing
the multiplication separately on the two components.
Refactor code to share the calculation with the previous
fix in \_\_cycles\_2\_ns().

TOMOYO: Fix mount flags checking order.
commit df91e49477a9be15921cb2854e1d12a3bdb5e425 upstream.
Userspace can pass in arbitrary combinations of MS\_\* flags to mount().
If both MS\_BIND and one of MS\_SHARED/MS\_PRIVATE/MS\_SLAVE/MS\_UNBINDABLE are
passed, device name which should be checked for MS\_BIND was not checked because
MS\_SHARED/MS\_PRIVATE/MS\_SLAVE/MS\_UNBINDABLE had higher priority than MS\_BIND.
If both one of MS\_BIND/MS\_MOVE and MS\_REMOUNT are passed, device name which
should not be checked for MS\_REMOUNT was checked because MS\_BIND/MS\_MOVE had
higher priority than MS\_REMOUNT.
Fix these bugs by changing priority to MS\_REMOUNT -> MS\_BIND ->
MS\_SHARED/MS\_PRIVATE/MS\_SLAVE/MS\_UNBINDABLE -> MS\_MOVE as with do\_mount() does.
Also, unconditionally return -EINVAL if more than one of
MS\_SHARED/MS\_PRIVATE/MS\_SLAVE/MS\_UNBINDABLE is passed so that TOMOYO will not
generate inaccurate audit logs, for commit 7a2e8a8f "VFS: Sanity check mount

android, lowmemorykiller: remove task handoff notifier
commit 83dbbdbb38666e20a75fad2294cf1df77c52f121 upstream.
The task handoff notifier leaks task\_struct since it never gets freed
after the callback returns NOTIFY\_OK, which means it is responsible for
doing so.
It turns out the lowmemorykiller actually doesn't need this notifier at
all. It's used to prevent unnecessary killing by waiting for a thread
to exit as a result of lowmem\_shrink(), however, it's possible to do
this in the same way the kernel oom killer works by setting TIF\_MEMDIE
and avoid killing if we're still waiting for it to exit.
The kernel oom killer will already automatically set TIF\_MEMDIE for
threads that are attempting to allocate memory that have a fatal signal.
The thread selected by lowmem\_shrink() will have such a signal after the
lowmemorykiller sends it a SIGKILL, so this won't result in an
unnecessary use of memory reserves for the thread to exit.
This has the added benefit that we don't have to rely on
CONFIG\_PROFILING to prevent needlessly killing tasks.

modpost: Fix modpost license checking of vmlinux.o
commit 258f742635360175564e9470eb060ff4d4b984e7 upstream.
Commit f02e8a6596b7 ("module: Sort exported symbols") sorts symbols
placing each of them in its own elf section. This sorting and merging
into the canonical sections are done by the linker.
Unfortunately modpost to generate Module.symvers file parses vmlinux.o
(which is not linked yet) and all modules object files (which aren't
linked yet). These aren't sanitized by the linker yet. That breaks
modpost that can't detect license properly for modules.
This patch makes modpost aware of the new exported symbols structure.
[ This above is a slightly corrected version of the explanation of the
problem, copied from commit 62a2635610db ("modpost: Fix modpost's
license checking V3"). That commit fixed the problem for module
object files, but not for vmlinux.o. This patch fixes modpost for

Add abort flag and use it to terminate processing when an exchange
is timed out or is reset. The abort flag is used in place of the
transport\_generic\_free\_cmd function call in the reset and timeout
cases, because calling that function in that context would free
memory that was in use. The aborted flag allows the lifetime to
be managed in a more normal way, while truncating the processing.
This change eliminates a source of memory corruption which
manifested in a variety of ugly ways.

mmc: sdio: Use empty system suspend/resume callbacks at the bus level
commit e841a7c69b708eeaf784fd517978006e8319b03a upstream.
Neil Brown reports that commit 35cd133c
PM: Run the driver callback directly if the subsystem one is not there
breaks suspend for his libertas wifi, because SDIO has a protocol
where the suspend method can return -ENOSYS and this means "There is
no point in suspending, just turn me off". Moreover, the suspend
methods provided by SDIO drivers are not supposed to be called by
the PM core or bus-level suspend routines (which aren't presend for
SDIO). Instead, when the SDIO core gets to suspend the device's
ancestor, it calls the device driver's suspend function, catches the
ENOSYS, and turns the device off.
The commit above breaks the SDIO core's assumption that the device
drivers' callbacks won't be executed if it doesn't provide any
bus-level callbacks. If fact, however, this assumption has never
been really satisfied, because device class or device type suspend
might very well use the driver's callback even without that commit.
The simplest way to address this problem is to make the SDIO core
tell the PM core to ignore driver callbacks, for example by providing
no-operation suspend/resume callbacks at the bus level for it,
which is implemented by this change.

x86,kgdb: Fix DEBUG\_RODATA limitation using text\_poke()
commit 3751d3e85cf693e10e2c47c03c8caa65e171099b upstream.
There has long been a limitation using software breakpoints with a
kernel compiled with CONFIG\_DEBUG\_RODATA going back to 2.6.26. For
this particular patch, it will apply cleanly and has been tested all
the way back to 2.6.36.
The kprobes code uses the text\_poke() function which accommodates
writing a breakpoint into a read-only page. The x86 kgdb code can
solve the problem similarly by overriding the default breakpoint
set/remove routines and using text\_poke() directly.
The x86 kgdb code will first attempt to use the traditional
probe\_kernel\_write(), and next try using a the text\_poke() function.
The break point install method is tracked such that the correct break
point removal routine will get called later on.

kgdbts: (2 of 2) fix single step awareness to work correctly with SMP
commit 23bbd8e346f1ef3fc1219c79cea53d8d52b207d8 upstream.
The do\_fork and sys\_open tests have never worked properly on anything
other than a UP configuration with the kgdb test suite. This is
because the test suite did not fully implement the behavior of a real
debugger. A real debugger tracks the state of what thread it asked to
single step and can correctly continue other threads of execution or
conditionally stop while waiting for the original thread single step
request to return.
Below is a simple method to cause a fatal kernel oops with the kgdb
test suite on a 2 processor ARM system:
while [ 1 ] ; do ls > /dev/null 2> /dev/null; done&
while [ 1 ] ; do ls > /dev/null 2> /dev/null; done&
echo V1I1F100 > /sys/module/kgdbts/parameters/kgdbts
Very soon after starting the test the kernel will start warning with
messages like:
kgdbts: BP mismatch c002487c expected c0024878
------------[ cut here ]------------
WARNING: at drivers/misc/kgdbts.c:317 check\_and\_rewind\_pc+0x9c/0xc4()
[] (check\_and\_rewind\_pc+0x9c/0xc4)
[] (validate\_simple\_test+0x3c/0xc4)
[] (run\_simple\_test+0x1e8/0x274)
The kernel will eventually recovers, but the test suite has completely
failed to test anything useful.
This patch implements behavior similar to a real debugger that does
not rely on hardware single stepping by using only software planted
breakpoints.
In order to mimic a real debugger, the kgdb test suite now tracks the
most recent thread that was continued (cont\_thread\_id), with the
intent to single step just this thread. When the response to the
single step request stops in a different thread that hit the original
break point that thread will now get continued, while the debugger
waits for the thread with the single step pending. Here is a high
level description of the sequence of events.
cont\_instead\_of\_sstep = 0;
1) set breakpoint at do\_fork
2) continue
3) Save the thread id where we stop to cont\_thread\_id
4) Remove breakpoint at do\_fork
5) Reset the PC if needed depending on kernel exception type
6) soft single step
7) Check where we stopped
if current thread != cont\_thread\_id {
if (here for more than 2 times for the same thead) {
### must be a really busy system, start test again ###
goto step 1
}
goto step 5
} else {
cont\_instead\_of\_sstep = 0;
}
8) clean up and run test again if needed
9) Clear out any threads that were waiting on a break point at the
point in time the test is ended with get\_cont\_catch(). This
happens sometimes because breakpoints are used in place of single
stepping and some threads could have been in the debugger exception
handling queue because breakpoints were hit concurrently on
different CPUs. This also means we wait at least one second before
unplumbing the debugger connection at the very end, so as respond
to any debug threads waiting to be serviced.

kgdbts: (1 of 2) fix single step awareness to work correctly with SMP
commit 486c5987a00a89d56c2c04c506417ef8f823ca2e upstream.
The do\_fork and sys\_open tests have never worked properly on anything
other than a UP configuration with the kgdb test suite. This is
because the test suite did not fully implement the behavior of a real
debugger. A real debugger tracks the state of what thread it asked to
single step and can correctly continue other threads of execution or
conditionally stop while waiting for the original thread single step
request to return.
Below is a simple method to cause a fatal kernel oops with the kgdb
test suite on a 4 processor x86 system:
while [ 1 ] ; do ls > /dev/null 2> /dev/null; done&
while [ 1 ] ; do ls > /dev/null 2> /dev/null; done&
while [ 1 ] ; do ls > /dev/null 2> /dev/null; done&
while [ 1 ] ; do ls > /dev/null 2> /dev/null; done&
echo V1I1F1000 > /sys/module/kgdbts/parameters/kgdbts
Very soon after starting the test the kernel will oops with a message like:
kgdbts: BP mismatch 3b7da66480 expected ffffffff8106a590
WARNING: at drivers/misc/kgdbts.c:303 check\_and\_rewind\_pc+0xe0/0x100()
Call Trace:
[] check\_and\_rewind\_pc+0xe0/0x100
[] validate\_simple\_test+0x25/0xc0
[] run\_simple\_test+0x107/0x2c0
[] kgdbts\_put\_char+0x18/0x20
The warn will turn to a hard kernel crash shortly after that because
the pc will not get properly rewound to the right value after hitting
a breakpoint leading to a hard lockup.
This change is broken up into 2 pieces because archs that have hw
single stepping (2.6.26 and up) need different changes than archs that
do not have hw single stepping (3.0 and up). This change implements
the correct behavior for an arch that supports hw single stepping.
A minor defect was fixed where sys\_open should be do\_sys\_open
for the sys\_open break point test. This solves the problem of running
a 64 bit with a 32 bit user space. The sys\_open() never gets called
when using the 32 bit file system for the kgdb testsuite because the
32 bit binaries invoke the compat\_sys\_open() call leading to the test
never completing.
In order to mimic a real debugger, the kgdb test suite now tracks the
most recent thread that was continued (cont\_thread\_id), with the
intent to single step just this thread. When the response to the
single step request stops in a different thread that hit the original
break point that thread will now get continued, while the debugger
waits for the thread with the single step pending. Here is a high
level description of the sequence of events.
cont\_instead\_of\_sstep = 0;
1) set breakpoint at do\_fork
2) continue
3) Save the thread id where we stop to cont\_thread\_id
4) Remove breakpoint at do\_fork
5) Reset the PC if needed depending on kernel exception type
6) if (cont\_instead\_of\_sstep) { continue } else { single step }
7) Check where we stopped
if current thread != cont\_thread\_id {
cont\_instead\_of\_sstep = 1;
goto step 5
} else {
cont\_instead\_of\_sstep = 0;
}
8) clean up and run test again if needed

kgdbts: Fix kernel oops with CONFIG\_DEBUG\_RODATA
commit 456ca7ff24841bf2d2a2dfd690fe7d42ef70d932 upstream.
On x86 the kgdb test suite will oops when the kernel is compiled with
CONFIG\_DEBUG\_RODATA and you run the tests after boot time. This is
regression has existed since 2.6.26 by commit: b33cb815 (kgdbts: Use
HW breakpoints with CONFIG\_DEBUG\_RODATA).
The test suite can use hw breakpoints for all the tests, but it has to
execute the hardware breakpoint specific tests first in order to
determine that the hw breakpoints actually work. Specifically the
very first test causes an oops:
# echo V1I1 > /sys/module/kgdbts/parameters/kgdbts
kgdb: Registered I/O driver kgdbts.
kgdbts:RUN plant and detach test
Entering kdb (current=0xffff880017aa9320, pid 1078) on processor 0 due to Keyboard Entry

[...oops clipped...]
This commit re-orders the running of the tests and puts the RODATA
check into its own function so as to correctly avoid the kernel oops
by detecting and using the hw breakpoints.

kgdb,debug\_core: pass the breakpoint struct instead of address and memory
commit 98b54aa1a2241b59372468bd1e9c2d207bdba54b upstream.
There is extra state information that needs to be exposed in the
kgdb\_bpt structure for tracking how a breakpoint was installed. The
debug\_core only uses the the probe\_kernel\_write() to install
breakpoints, but this is not enough for all the archs. Some arch such
as x86 need to use text\_poke() in order to install a breakpoint into a
read only page.
Passing the kgdb\_bpt structure to kgdb\_arch\_set\_breakpoint() and
kgdb\_arch\_remove\_breakpoint() allows other archs to set the type
variable which indicates how the breakpoint was installed.

PM / Sleep: Mitigate race between the freezer and request\_firmware()
commit 247bc03742545fec2f79939a3b9f738392a0f7b4 upstream.
There is a race condition between the freezer and request\_firmware()
such that if request\_firmware() is run on one CPU and
freeze\_processes() is run on another CPU and usermodehelper\_disable()
called by it succeeds to grab umhelper\_sem for writing before
usermodehelper\_read\_trylock() called from request\_firmware()
acquires it for reading, the request\_firmware() will fail and
trigger a WARN\_ON() complaining that it was called at a wrong time.
However, in fact, it wasn't called at a wrong time and
freeze\_processes() simply happened to be executed simultaneously.
To avoid this race, at least in some cases, modify
usermodehelper\_read\_trylock() so that it doesn't fail if the
freezing of tasks has just started and hasn't been completed yet.
Instead, during the freezing of tasks, it will try to freeze the
task that has called it so that it can wait until user space is
thawed without triggering the scary warning.
For this purpose, change usermodehelper\_disabled so that it can
take three different values, UMH\_ENABLED (0), UMH\_FREEZING and
UMH\_DISABLED. The first one means that usermode helpers are
enabled, the last one means "hard disable" (i.e. the system is not
ready for usermode helpers to be used) and the second one
is reserved for the freezer. Namely, when freeze\_processes() is
started, it sets usermodehelper\_disabled to UMH\_FREEZING which
tells usermodehelper\_read\_trylock() that it shouldn't fail just
yet and should call try\_to\_freeze() if woken up and cannot
return immediately. This way all freezable tasks that happen
to call request\_firmware() right before freeze\_processes() is
started and lose the race for umhelper\_sem with it will be
frozen and will sleep until thaw\_processes() unsets
usermodehelper\_disabled. [For the non-freezable callers of
request\_firmware() the race for umhelper\_sem against
freeze\_processes() is unfortunately unavoidable.]

PM / Sleep: Move disabling of usermode helpers to the freezer
commit 1e73203cd1157a03facc41ffb54050f5b28e55bd upstream.
The core suspend/hibernation code calls usermodehelper\_disable() to
avoid race conditions between the freezer and the starting of
usermode helpers and each code path has to do that on its own.
However, it is always called right before freeze\_processes()
and usermodehelper\_enable() is always called right after
thaw\_processes(). For this reason, to avoid code duplication and
to make the connection between usermodehelper\_disable() and the
freezer more visible, make freeze\_processes() call it and remove the
direct usermodehelper\_disable() and usermodehelper\_enable() calls
from all suspend/hibernation code paths.

PM / Runtime: don't forget to wake up waitqueue on failure
commit f2791d733a2f06997b573d1a3cfde21e6f529826 upstream.
This patch (as1535) fixes a bug in the runtime PM core. When a
runtime suspend attempt completes, whether successfully or not, the
device's power.wait\_queue is supposed to be signalled. But this
doesn't happen in the failure pathway of rpm\_suspend() when another
autosuspend attempt is rescheduled. As a result, a task can get stuck
indefinitely on the wait queue (I have seen this happen in testing).
The patch fixes the problem by moving the wake\_up\_all() call up near
the start of the failure code.

firmware\_class: Do not warn that system is not ready from async loads
commit 9b78c1da60b3c62ccdd1509f0902ad19ceaf776b upstream.
If firmware is requested asynchronously, by calling
request\_firmware\_nowait(), there is no reason to fail the request
(and warn the user) when the system is (presumably temporarily)
unready to handle it (because user space is not available yet or
frozen). For this reason, introduce an alternative routine for
read-locking umhelper\_sem, usermodehelper\_read\_lock\_wait(), that
will wait for usermodehelper\_disabled to be unset (possibly with
a timeout) and make request\_firmware\_work\_func() use it instead of
usermodehelper\_read\_trylock().
Accordingly, modify request\_firmware() so that it uses
usermodehelper\_read\_trylock() to acquire umhelper\_sem and remove
the code related to that lock from \_request\_firmware().

For these users, we should therefore reject any userspace request to

commit 2ee0a07028d2cde6e131b73f029dae2b93c50f3a upstream.
Currently the maximum noise floor limit is set as too high (-60dB). The
assumption of having a higher threshold limit is that it would help
de-sensitize the receiver (reduce phy errors) from continuous
interference. But when we have a bursty interference where there are
collisions and then free air time and if the receiver is desensitized too
much, it will miss the normal packets too. Lets make use of chips
specific min, nom and max limits always. This patch helps to improve the
connection stability in congested networks.

tracing: Fix ent\_size in trace output
commit 12b5da349a8b94c9dbc3430a6bc42eabd9eaf50b upstream.
When reading the trace file, the records of each of the per\_cpu buffers
are examined to find the next event to print out. At the point of looking
at the event, the size of the event is recorded. But if the first event is
chosen, the other events in the other CPU buffers will reset the event size
that is stored in the iterator descriptor, causing the event size passed to
the output functions to be incorrect.
In most cases this is not a problem, but for the case of stack traces, it
is. With the change to the stack tracing to record a dynamic number of
back traces, the output depends on the size of the entry instead of the
fixed 8 back traces. When the entry size is not correct, the back traces
would not be fully printed.
Note, reading from the per-cpu trace files were not affected.

commit f5cb92ac82d06cb583c1f66666314c5c0a4d7913 upstream.
irq\_move\_masked\_irq() checks the return code of
chip->irq\_set\_affinity() only for 0, but IRQ\_SET\_MASK\_OK\_NOCOPY is
also a valid return code, which is there to avoid a redundant copy of
the cpumask. But in case of IRQ\_SET\_MASK\_OK\_NOCOPY we not only avoid
the redundant copy, we also fail to adjust the thread affinity of an
eventually threaded interrupt handler.
Handle IRQ\_SET\_MASK\_OK (==0) and IRQ\_SET\_MASK\_OK\_NOCOPY(==1) return
values correctly by checking the valid return values seperately.

ACPICA: Fix regression in FADT revision checks
commit 3e80acd1af40fcd91a200b0416a7616b20c5d647 upstream.
commit 64b3db22c04586997ab4be46dd5a5b99f8a2d390 (2.6.39),
"Remove use of unreliable FADT revision field" causes regression
for old P4 systems because now cst\_control and other fields are
not reset to 0.
The effect is that acpi\_processor\_power\_init will notice
cst\_control != 0 and a write to CST\_CNT register is performed
that should not happen. As result, the system oopses after the
"No \_CST, giving up" message, sometimes in acpi\_ns\_internalize\_name,
sometimes in acpi\_ns\_get\_type, usually at random places. May be
during migration to CPU 1 in acpi\_processor\_get\_throttling.
Every one of these settings help to avoid this problem:
- acpi=off
- processor.nocst=1
- maxcpus=1
The fix is to update acpi\_gbl\_FADT.header.length after
the original value is used to check for old revisions.

PNPACPI: Fix device ref leaking in acpi\_pnp\_match
commit 89e96ada572fb216e582dbe3f64e1a6939a37f74 upstream.
During testing pci root bus removal, found some root bus bridge is not freed.
If booting with pnpacpi=off, those hostbridge could be freed without problem.
It turns out that some devices reference are not released during acpi\_pnp\_match.
that match should not hold one device ref during every calling.

ACPI: Do cpufreq clamping for throttling per package v2
commit 2815ab92ba3ab27556212cc306288dc95692824b upstream.
On Intel CPUs the processor typically uses the highest frequency
set by any logical CPU. When the system overheats
Linux first forces the frequency to the lowest available one
to lower the temperature.
However this was done only per logical CPU, which means all
logical CPUs in a package would need to go through this before
the frequency is actually lowered.
Worse this delay actually prevents real throttling, because
the real throttle code only proceeds when the lowest frequency
is already reached.
So when a throttle event happens force the lowest frequency
for all CPUs in the package where it happened. The per CPU
state is now kept per package, not per logical CPU. An alternative
would be to do it per cpufreq unit, but since we want to bring
down the temperature of the complete chip it's better
to do it for all.
In principle it may even make sense to do it for all CPUs,
but I kept it on the package for now.
With this change the frequency is actually lowered, which
in terms also allows real throttling to proceed.
I also removed an unnecessary per cpu variable initialization.

ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix ADC assignment with a shared HP/Mic pin
commit 26acaf08556a3c64ebf8ea3654b51e6acbb0a26c upstream.
The recent Realtek driver tries to assign an extra input via the
headphone plug when only a single input source is found. The code
worked on Samsung Q1, but it broke ASUS 1015 where the mic is a
digital-mic and only a specific ADC works.
This patch fixes the assignment of ADC in the shared mic/hp case.
Instead of assuming the single ADC at first, reduce the ADCs after
trying to assign both mic and HP pins.

## Synopsis

Moderate: kernel security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1580)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, numerous bugs
and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* It was found that the RHSA-2012:0862 update did not correctly fix the

CVE-2011-4131 issue. A malicious Network File System version 4 (NFSv4)
server could return a crafted reply to a GETACL request, causing a denial
of service on the client. (CVE-2012-2375, Moderate)

* A divide-by-zero flaw was found in the TCP Illinois congestion control

algorithm implementation in the Linux kernel. If the TCP Illinois
congestion control algorithm were in use (the sysctl
net.ipv4.tcp\_congestion\_control variable set to "illinois"), a local,
unprivileged user could trigger this flaw and cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2012-4565, Moderate)

* A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way a new node's hot

added memory was propagated to other nodes' zonelists. By utilizing this
newly added memory from one of the remaining nodes, a local, unprivileged
user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-5517,
Moderate)

* It was found that the initial release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 did

not correctly fix the CVE-2009-4307 issue, a divide-by-zero flaw in the
ext4 file system code. A local, unprivileged user with the ability to mount
an ext4 file system could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2012-2100, Low)

* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation

handled overlapping, fragmented IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could
potentially use this flaw to bypass protection mechanisms (such as a
firewall or intrusion detection system (IDS)) when sending network packets
to a target system. (CVE-2012-4444, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Antonios Atlasis working with Beyond Security's
SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program and Loganaden Velvindron of AFRINIC
for reporting CVE-2012-4444. The CVE-2012-2375 issue was discovered by Jian
Li of Red Hat, and CVE-2012-4565 was discovered by Rodrigo Freire of Red
Hat.

This update also fixes numerous bugs and adds one enhancement. Space
precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Documentation
for these changes will be available shortly from the Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6.3 Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, fix these bugs and add the enhancement
noted in the Technical Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.
