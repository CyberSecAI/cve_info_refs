Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-3363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `SimpleXMLElement` class (from the SimpleXML PHP extension) in `Zend_XmlRpc`. This class is used to parse XML data, and it is susceptible to XML eXternal Entity (XXE) injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE Injection:** The core issue is the presence of an XXE vulnerability in how `Zend_XmlRpc` processes XML data. By crafting a malicious XML document with a specific DOCTYPE element, an attacker can define external entities that can be used to access local files or initiate TCP connections.
- **Insecure XML Parsing:** The `SimpleXMLElement` class in PHP, when not used properly, processes external entities by default, leading to this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
- **TCP Connections:** Attackers could force the server to establish TCP connections to arbitrary hosts, potentially leading to further attacks or information leaks.
- **Information Disclosure:** In general, the vulnerability allows for information to be disclosed, potentially sensitive server-side information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending specially crafted XML-RPC requests to the server. These requests contain a malicious DOCTYPE element, which defines the external entities the server will try to process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send XML-RPC requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of XML-RPC:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious XML-RPC requests with the specific DOCTYPE to exploit the XXE vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in `Zend_XmlRpc`, but also in `Zend_Dom`, `Zend_Feed`, and `Zend_Soap`, where similar insecure XML parsing was present.
- Patches were applied by invoking `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` prior to instantiating any `SimpleXML` objects, disabling XXE parsing.
- Moodle, a popular learning platform, was also affected due to its use of the Zend library. Moodle versions 2.4 to 2.4.1, 2.3 to 2.3.4, and 2.2 to 2.2.7 were vulnerable. Fixed versions are 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, 2.3.5 and 2.3.6, 2.2.8 and 2.2.9.
- The vulnerability was also fixed in Debian's `zendframework` package.
- It's important to note that the vulnerability was present in Zend Framework versions before the fixes (1.11.12 and greater, also backported to 1.10.6-1squeeze1 for Debian Squeeze and 2.0.0 development branch)
