## MGASA-2012-0266

| **Date:** | September 13th, 2012 |
| --- | --- |
| **Affected releases:** | 1, 2 |

**Description:**

Updated ocaml-xml-light packages fix security vulnerability:

OCaml Xml-Light Library before r234 computes hash values without

restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably,

which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service

(CPU consumption) via unspecified vectors (CVE-2012-3514).

Additionally, ocaml-dose3 has been rebuilt to include the updated

ocaml-xml-light.

**Updated Packages:**

Mageia 1:

ocaml-xml-light-2.2-18.1.mga1

ocaml-xml-light-devel-2.2-18.1.mga1

ocaml-dose3-2.9.2-2.2457.2.1.mga1

ocaml-dose3-devel-2.9.2-2.2457.2.1.mga1

Mageia 2:

ocaml-xml-light-2.2-19.1.mga2

ocaml-xml-light-devel-2.2-19.1.mga2

ocaml-dose3-2.9.10-3.1.mga2

ocaml-dose3-devel-2.9.10-3.1.mga2

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: ocaml-xml-light: hash table collisions CPU usage DoS CVE-2012-3514

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Xml-Light has been moved to google code SVN here :
<http://ocamllibs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/xml-light/>

I've applied a fix in r234 by using String Map instead of Hashtbl for
DTD proof.

Best,
Nicolas

Please use CVE-2012-3514 for this issue.

Installing ocaml-dose3 requires librpm-devel which for the Testing version of rpm is not available with Testing disabled.  The workaround is to install from Release with Testing enabled using:  # urpmi --searchmedia Release ocaml-dose3  The side effect is that it installs further rpm libs from Testing for which we have no bug yet and could give misleading results. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=7276#c14)  claire robinson    2012-09-10 14:28:22 CEST  ``` From Release version, some dangling links:  $ ll /usr/bin/eclipsecheck lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 81 Sep 10 13:05 /usr/bin/eclipsecheck -> ../../home/iurt/rpm/BUILDROOT/ocaml-dose3-2.9.10-3.mga2.x86_64//usr/bin/distcheck  $ ll /usr/bin/debcheck lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 81 Sep 10 13:05 /usr/bin/debcheck -> ../../home/iurt/rpm/BUILDROOT/ocaml-dose3-2.9.10-3.mga2.x86_64//usr/bin/distcheck  $ ll /usr/bin/rpmcheck lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 81 Sep 10 13:05 /usr/bin/rpmcheck -> ../../home/iurt/rpm/BUILDROOT/ocaml-dose3-2.9.10-3.mga2.x86_64//usr/bin/distcheck ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=7276#c15)  claire robinson    2012-09-10 16:00:30 CEST  ``` Not sure how to use this, testing first with Release version..

Thanks for the procedures.  Could someone from the sysadmin team please push the srpms ocaml-xml-light-2.2-19.1.mga2.src.rpm ocaml-dose3-2.9.10-3.1.mga2.src.rpm from Mageia 2 Core Updates Testing to Core Updates and the srpms ocaml-xml-light-2.2-18.1.mga1.src.rpm ocaml-dose3-2.9.2-2.2457.2.1.mga1.src.rpm from Mageia 1 Core Updates Testing to Core Updates.  Advisory: Updated ocaml-xml-light packages fix security vulnerability:  OCaml Xml-Light Library before r234 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via unspecified vectors (CVE-2012-3514).  Additionally, ocaml-dose3 has been rebuilt to include the updated ocaml-xml-light.
