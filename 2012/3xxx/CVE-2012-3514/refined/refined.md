Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3514:

**Root Cause:**
- The OCaml Xml-Light library, before revision r234, used a hash table implementation without proper restrictions on hash collisions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Hash Collision Vulnerability:** The library was susceptible to predictable hash collisions. This is due to the hash function used to create keys for the hash table. When a hash collision occurs, an element is appended to a linked list of collisions. If an attacker can predict the hash and cause many collisions, the linked list can grow large, slowing down table lookups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting specific input that causes numerous hash collisions, an attacker can force the library to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unspecified Vectors:** The exact means of delivering the malicious input that causes hash collisions is not explicitly detailed in this documentation beyond it being context-dependent.
- **XML Parsing:**  The vulnerability is triggered when parsing XML data with the vulnerable library

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Context-Dependent:**  The attacker needs to be in a position to supply input that is processed by the vulnerable XML parsing library, and capable of crafting the specific type of input that causes hash collisions.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involved switching from a `Hashtbl` implementation to `String Map` for DTD proof.
- The vulnerability affects not only the `ocaml-xml-light` package itself but also other packages that bundle the library, such as `ocaml-dose3` in Mageia distributions.
- The provided information is more detailed than the basic CVE description.
