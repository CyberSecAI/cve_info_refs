**Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic error in Safari's handling of the Quarantine attribute.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The safe mode, designed to prevent access to local and remote resources for quarantined HTML documents, was not triggered due to the logic error. This allowed quarantined HTML files to operate outside the intended sandbox.

**Impact of exploitation:** Opening a maliciously crafted downloaded HTML document could lead to the disclosure of local file content.

**Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could create a specially crafted HTML document and have a user download and open it in Safari.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted HTML document to a victim and convince them to open it with Safari. The user must also be using a vulnerable version of Safari on OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1.
