Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3462:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the SSSD (System Security Services Daemon) access-provider logic. Specifically, when the access-provider is responsible for both processing Host-Based Access Control (HBAC) rules and setting the SELinux user context, the HBAC rule processing result is ignored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HBAC Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of HBAC rules. Even if a user is explicitly denied access by HBAC rules, the SSSD will still grant access if it is also configured to set the user's SELinux context.
- **Logic Error:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the SSSD's internal logic where the HBAC result is not properly taken into consideration when SELinux context setting is also performed by the same access provider.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Users who should be denied access according to HBAC rules are granted access to the system. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources and potential compromise of system security.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly mentioned, the ability to bypass HBAC rules could potentially be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve privilege escalation or further unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Login:** The attack vector is user login. By attempting to log in as a user who is denied access by HBAC rules but has a corresponding SELinux context rule, an attacker can bypass the access control and gain unauthorized access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Account:** The attacker must have a user account that exists on the FreeIPA server.
- **Knowledge of HBAC Rules:** The attacker doesn't necessarily need explicit knowledge of HBAC rules, but they need to be a user who would be denied access by such rules.
- **FreeIPA Configuration:** The attacker exploits the fact that the system is configured to use FreeIPA for both HBAC and SELinux context.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to log into the client system with the vulnerable SSSD configuration.

**More Detail than CVE:**
Yes, the provided content gives much more detail than a basic CVE description would, including:
- Specific SSSD version affected (sssd-1.9.0-14.fc18.beta6)
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected and actual results
- Reference to upstream patch and bugzilla
- The root cause of the vulnerability being a logic error in the SSSD's access-provider

**Summary of content:**
The SSSD component improperly handles scenarios where both HBAC rules and SELinux user context are managed through the same access provider (FreeIPA). When both configurations are active, HBAC rules are ignored, granting unauthorized access. The issue affects versions up to sssd-1.9.0-14.fc18.beta6 and can be reproduced by configuring a system to use FreeIPA for both access control and SELinux context management.
