  "CVE-2012-3992": {
    "description": "Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the location property. In this issue, writes to `location.hash` can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to cause a specific website to be loaded into the history object. The `baseURI` can then be changed to this stored site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept posted data posted to a location specified with a relative path.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A history state error allows for spoofing of the location property.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of `location.hash` writes in combination with scripted history navigation.",
        "Ability to change `baseURI` to a stored site in history.",
