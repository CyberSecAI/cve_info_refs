Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1970 CVE-2012-1972 CVE-2012-1973 CVE-2012-1974
                 CVE-2012-1975 CVE-2012-1976 CVE-2012-3959 CVE-2012-3962
                 CVE-2012-3969 CVE-2012-3972 CVE-2012-3978

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client.

This includes several instances of use-after-free and buffer overflow
issues.  The reported vulnerabilities could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, and additionally to the bypass of content-loading
restrictions via the location object.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze13.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.7-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web
browser based on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides
rendering services for several other applications included in Debian.

The reported vulnerabilities could lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or the bypass of content-loading restrictions via the location
object.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.16-18.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.7esr-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.7esr-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-63

## SVG buffer overflow and use-after-free issues

Announced
August 28, 2012
Reporter
Arthur Gerkis
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 15
* Firefox ESR 10.0.7
* SeaMonkey 2.12
* Thunderbird 15
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.7

### Description

Security researcher **Arthur Gerkis** used the Address Sanitizer
tool to find two issues involving Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The
first issue is a buffer overflow in Gecko's SVG filter code when the sum of two
values is too large to be stored as a signed 32-bit integer, causing the
function to write past the end of an array. The second issue is a use-after-free
when an element with a "requiredFeatures" attribute is moved between documents.
In that situation, the internal representation of the "requiredFeatures" value
could be freed prematurely. Both issues are potentially exploitable.

## Details

Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew

Sutherland, Jason Smith, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel

Holbert discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit

these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1970](/security/CVE-2012-1970), [CVE-2012-1971](/security/CVE-2012-1971))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1972](/security/CVE-2012-1972), [CVE-2012-1973](/security/CVE-2012-1973), [CVE-2012-1974](/security/CVE-2012-1974), [CVE-2012-1975](/security/CVE-2012-1975), [CVE-2012-1976](/security/CVE-2012-1976),

[CVE-2012-3956](/security/CVE-2012-3956), [CVE-2012-3957](/security/CVE-2012-3957), [CVE-2012-3958](/security/CVE-2012-3958), [CVE-2012-3959](/security/CVE-2012-3959), [CVE-2012-3960](/security/CVE-2012-3960),

[CVE-2012-3961](/security/CVE-2012-3961), [CVE-2012-3962](/security/CVE-2012-3962), [CVE-2012-3963](/security/CVE-2012-3963), [CVE-2012-3964](/security/CVE-2012-3964))

Mariusz Mlynsk discovered that it is possible to shadow the location object

using Object.defineProperty. This could potentially result in a cross-site

scripting (XSS) attack against plugins. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents or steal

confidential data within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-1956](/security/CVE-2012-1956))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered an escalation of privilege vulnerability through

about:newtab. This could possibly lead to potentially code execution with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3965](/security/CVE-2012-3965))

Frédéric Hoguin discovered that bitmap format images with a negative height

could potentially result in memory corruption. If the user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-3966](/security/CVE-2012-3966))

It was discovered that Firefox's WebGL implementation was vulnerable to

multiple memory safety issues. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial

of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3967](/security/CVE-2012-3967), [CVE-2012-3968](/security/CVE-2012-3968))

Arthur Gerkis discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox's

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) implementation. If the user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit these to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3969](/security/CVE-2012-3969),

[CVE-2012-3970](/security/CVE-2012-3970))

Christoph Diehl discovered multiple memory safety issues in the bundled

Graphite 2 library. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3971](/security/CVE-2012-3971))

Nicolas Grégoire discovered an out-of-bounds read in the format-number

feature of XSLT. This could potentially cause inaccurate formatting of

numbers and information leakage. ([CVE-2012-3972](/security/CVE-2012-3972))

Mark Goodwin discovered that under certain circumstances, Firefox's

developer tools could allow remote debugging even when disabled.

([CVE-2012-3973](/security/CVE-2012-3973))

It was discovered that when the DOMParser is used to parse text/html data

in a Firefox extension, linked resources within this HTML data will be

loaded. If the data being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could

lead to information leakage and potentially be combined with other attacks

to become exploitable. ([CVE-2012-3975](/security/CVE-2012-3975))

Mark Poticha discovered that under certain circumstances incorrect SSL

certificate information can be displayed on the addressbar, showing the SSL

data for a previous site while another has been loaded. This could

potentially be used for phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-3976](/security/CVE-2012-3976))

It was discovered that, in some instances, certain security checks in the

location object could be bypassed. This could allow for the loading of

restricted content and can potentially be combined with other issues to

become exploitable. ([CVE-2012-3978](/security/CVE-2012-3978))

Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can execute injected

code with chrome privileges, leading to the running of malicious code in a

privileged context. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3980](/security/CVE-2012-3980))

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1211)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes multiple security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-1970,
CVE-2012-1972, CVE-2012-1973, CVE-2012-1974, CVE-2012-1975, CVE-2012-1976,
CVE-2012-3956, CVE-2012-3957, CVE-2012-3958, CVE-2012-3959, CVE-2012-3960,
CVE-2012-3961, CVE-2012-3962, CVE-2012-3963, CVE-2012-3964)

Content containing a malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image file
could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3969,
CVE-2012-3970)

Two flaws were found in the way Thunderbird rendered certain images using
WebGL. Malicious content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, under certain
conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3967, CVE-2012-3968)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird decoded embedded bitmap images in
Icon Format (ICO) files. Content containing a malicious ICO file could
cause Thunderbird to crash or, under certain conditions, possibly execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2012-3966)

A flaw was found in the way the "eval" command was handled by the
Thunderbird Error Console. Running "eval" in the Error Console while
viewing malicious content could possibly cause Thunderbird to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird.
(CVE-2012-3980)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the way Thunderbird used the
format-number feature of XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations). Malicious content could possibly cause an information
leak, or cause Thunderbird to crash. (CVE-2012-3972)

A flaw was found in the location object implementation in Thunderbird.
Malicious content could use this flaw to possibly allow restricted content
to be loaded. (CVE-2012-3978)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, John
Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic, Daniel Holbert, Abhishek Arya, Frederic
Hoguin, miaubiz, Arthur Gerkis, Nicolas Gregoire, moz\_bug\_r\_a4, and Colby
Russell as the original reporters of these issues.

Note: All issues except CVE-2012-3969 and CVE-2012-3970 cannot be exploited
by a specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by
default for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in
Thunderbird, for example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS
feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.7 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

ASan detected use-after-free when running attached test-case. ASan log is for build <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/12ab69851e05>
When testing, was not able to reproduce on Windows 7 x64 - nor stable, neither 15.0a1. Crashes for me only on Linux (Ubuntu 11.10 x64)

Is DOMSVGTests.cpp only a test file, or is that present in release builds? Is the problem \_in\_ the SVG file or is it a bug in the underlying nsTArray?

(In reply to Daniel Veditz [:dveditz] from [comment #2](/show_bug.cgi?id=760996#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsTArray_base<nsTArrayDefaultAllocator>::Length()"))
> Is DOMSVGTests.cpp only a test file, or is that present in release builds?
Present in release builds. It lets authors render different content depending on available features & the system language.
> Is the problem \_in\_ the SVG file or is it a bug in the underlying nsTArray?
It's almost certainly a SVG bug.
> Daniel: can you find an owner for this one? Thanks!
CC'ing longsonr, since he wrote that file and has been working with that code recently.
In fact -- I'd bet that this is fixed by his patch on [bug 761507](/show_bug.cgi?id=761507 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with adoptNode, requiredExtensions"). (That patch lets us keep DOMSVGTests' PropertyTable entries around after adoptNode is called, and this bug's ASAN log is in nsDocument::AdoptNode() calling nsPropertyTable::PropertyList::DeletePropertyFor, so I doubt we'll hit the ASAN-flagged stack anymore.)
That patch has landed on mozilla-inbound, but it hasn't quite made it to mozilla-central yet. Once it does, it'd be awesome if Arthur or someone with ASAN configuration could re-test to verify that this is fixed.Whiteboard: [dupe of bug 761507?]

[bug 761507](/show_bug.cgi?id=761507 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with adoptNode, requiredExtensions")'s patch has now made it to mozilla-central ([bug 761507 comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=761507#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with adoptNode, requiredExtensions")).
:decoder tells me he's making automated Linux 64-bit ASAN builds now, so I tried the one from yesterday and the one from today -- those are, in order:
[http://people.mozilla.org/~choller/firefox/asan/20120606-mozilla-central-debug-a6c39a15557b+asan.html](http://people.mozilla.org/~choller/firefox/asan/20120606-mozilla-central-debug-a6c39a15557b%2Basan.html)

Using the testcase attached here, yesterday's build crashes and reports a use-after-free. Today's build is fine -- no crash, no use-after-free. So, confirmed fixed by [bug 761507](/show_bug.cgi?id=761507 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash with adoptNode, requiredExtensions"). Pretty sure this is a duplicate of that bug -- marking as such.

Daniel: if you don't mind I'd like to call this one "FIXED" rather than "DUPE" as a testing hint that we should verify this testcase separately to be sure. I'm going to save Al some work by marking this verified based on [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=760996#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-use-after-free in nsTArray_base<nsTArrayDefaultAllocator>::Length()"), but we should double-check when this lands on Aurora (to make Firefox 15).Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

According to <http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html> the bug must be in a Beta or release candidate. Unless we fail to fix it in Aurora, that won't be the case will it?

I don't think the document is right there, or at least the formulation is misleading. Even nightly is eligible for bug bounty and has always been since I learned about the program.

The problem is at this line:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/75cdb3f932c6/content/svg/content/src/nsSVGFilters.cpp#l3830>
PRUint32 endX = NS\_MIN(x + rx, instance->GetSurfaceWidth() - 1);
When things go bad we have:
x == 256
rx == 2147483392
instance->GetSurfaceWidth() == 308
Since all three of these variables are of type PRInt32, we end up calling NS\_MIN<PRInt32>(), but the sum of x and rx is too large to be stored in a PRInt32, so it overflows and the first argument to NS\_MIN ends up being negative (-2147483648). That negative argument is then returned by NS\_MIN and assigned to the

[hit submit by accident. last paragraph should be the following]
Since all three of these variables are of type PRInt32 we end up calling NS\_MIN<PRInt32>(), but the sum of x and rx overflows PRInt32 and the first argument to NS\_MIN ends up being negative (-2147483648). That negative argument is then returned by NS\_MIN and when assigned to the unsigned variable endX ends up being 2147483648. That causes us to loop over bad memory.

This looks fine but a) don't check this test in and b) let's clamp the radius to some reasonable value, say 100000. In fact, let's go through all the filter primitives and clamp all their number parameter inputs to reasonable values.

> Still need to remember to check the testcase in after 15 goes out the door.
Typical options are to query for your fixed bugs with the in-testsuite? flag, or clone the bug into a new "check in testcase for [bug 782141](/show_bug.cgi?id=782141 "VERIFIED FIXED - Heap-buffer-overflow in nsSVGFEMorphologyElement::Filter")" bug and set the target milestone out a release or whatever is necessary.
Since the code looks the same at a quick glance I'm going to assume we need this fixed on the ESR-10 branch for the corresponding release. Please unset the status if not.

Attached patch

[patch for esr10](attachment.cgi?id=654379&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=654379&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=782141&attachment=654379)

The crash is not reproducible on esr10 with the testcase supplied, or with the reduced testcase. It doesn't seem to be reproducible on nightlies until the patch for [bug 734079](/show_bug.cgi?id=734079 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update SVG frame bounds asynchronously, and get rid of the suspendRedraw code") landed. It's not clear to me why that patch would expose the vulnerability, since it didn't touch the vulnerable code. It seems most likely that it indirectly changed the input values at which a crash can be reproduced. Most likely there is some permutation of the numbers in the test that could be found that would reproduce the crash prior to the patch for [bug 734079](/show_bug.cgi?id=734079 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update SVG frame bounds asynchronously, and get rid of the suspendRedraw code"), and on the esr10 branch too. Hence, here is a patch for the esr10 branch to fix the vulnerable code even though we don't have a test to reproduce the crash.
I'm currently away on a course and not back properly until Friday, so if this gets approved it would be great if someone could land it for me if I don't get to it first. The patch builds for me on esr10 branch locally on Mac.

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes three new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to 10.0.7ESR release, fixing a
lot of bugs and security problems.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
MFSA 2012-57: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-1971: Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse
Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew Sutherland, and
Jason Smith reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 14.
\*
CVE-2012-1970: Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse
Ruderman, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel
Holbert reported memory safety problems and crashes that
affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 14.
\*
MFSA 2012-58: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free issues using the Address Sanitizer
tool. Many of these issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution.
o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLEditor::CollapseAdjacentTextNodes CVE-2012-1972 o
Heap-use-after-free in nsObjectLoadingContent::LoadObject
CVE-2012-1973 o Heap-use-after-free in
gfxTextRun::CanBreakLineBefore CVE-2012-1974 o
Heap-use-after-free in PresShell::CompleteMove
CVE-2012-1975 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLSelectElement::SubmitNamesValues CVE-2012-1976 o
Heap-use-after-free in
MediaStreamGraphThreadRunnable::Run() CVE-2012-3956 o
Heap-buffer-overflow in nsBlockFrame::MarkLineDirty
CVE-2012-3957 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLEditRules::DeleteNonTableElements CVE-2012-3958 o
Heap-use-after-free in nsRangeUpdater::SelAdjDeleteNode
CVE-2012-3959 o Heap-use-after-free in
mozSpellChecker::SetCurrentDictionary CVE-2012-3960 o
Heap-use-after-free in RangeData::~RangeData CVE-2012-3961
o Bad iterator in text runs CVE-2012-3962 o use after free
in js::gc::MapAllocToTraceKind CVE-2012-3963 o
Heap-use-after-free READ 8 in gfxTextRun::GetUserData
CVE-2012-3964
\*
MFSA 2012-59 / CVE-2012-1956: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that it is possible to shadow the
location object using Object.defineProperty. This could be
used to confuse the current location to plugins, allowing
for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-60 / CVE-2012-3965: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a page opens a new tab,
a subsequent window can then be opened that can be
navigated to about:newtab, a chrome privileged page. Once
about:newtab is loaded, the special context can potentially
be used to escalate privilege, allowing for arbitrary code
execution on the local system in a maliciously crafted
attack.
\*
MFSA 2012-61 / CVE-2012-3966: Security researcher
Frederic Hoguin reported two related issues with the
decoding of bitmap (.BMP) format images embedded in icon
(.ICO) format files. When processing a negative "height"
header value for the bitmap image, a memory corruption can
be induced, allowing an attacker to write random memory and
cause a crash. This crash may be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-62: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover two WebGL issues. The
first issue is a use-after-free when WebGL shaders are
called after being destroyed. The second issue exposes a
problem with Mesa drivers on Linux, leading to a
potentially exploitable crash.
o
use after free, webgl fragment shader deleted
by accessor CVE-2012-3968
o
stack scribbling with 4-byte values choosable
among a few values, when using more than 16 sampler
uniforms, on Mesa, with all drivers CVE-2012-3967
\*
MFSA 2012-63: Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used
the Address Sanitizer tool to find two issues involving
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The first issue is a
buffer overflow in Gecko's SVG filter code when the sum of
two values is too large to be stored as a signed 32-bit
integer, causing the function to write past the end of an
array. The second issue is a use-after-free when an element
with a "requiredFeatures" attribute is moved between
documents. In that situation, the internal representation
of the "requiredFeatures" value could be freed prematurely.
Both issues are potentially exploitable.
o
Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsSVGFEMorphologyElement::Filter CVE-2012-3969
o
Heap-use-after-free in nsTArray\_base::Length()
CVE-2012-3970
\*
MFSA 2012-64 / CVE-2012-3971: Using the Address
Sanitizer tool, Mozilla security researcher Christoph Diehl
discovered two memory corruption issues involving the
Graphite 2 library used in Mozilla products. Both of these
issues can cause a potentially exploitable crash. These
problems were fixed in the Graphite 2 library, which has
been updated for Mozilla products.
\*
MFSA 2012-65 / CVE-2012-3972: Security research
Nicolas Gregoire used the Address Sanitizer tool to
discover an out-of-bounds read in the format-number feature
of XSLT, which can cause inaccurate formatting of numbers
and information leakage. This is not directly exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-66 / CVE-2012-3973: Mozilla security
researcher Mark Goodwin discovered an issue with the
Firefox developer tools' debugger. If remote debugging is
disabled, but the experimental HTTPMonitor extension has
been installed and enabled, a remote user can connect to
and use the remote debugging service through the port used
by HTTPMonitor. A remote-enabled flag has been added to
resolve this problem and close the port unless debugging is
explicitly enabled.
\*
MFSA 2012-67 / CVE-2012-3974: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa reported that if a crafted executable is
placed in the root partition on a Windows file system, the
Firefox and Thunderbird installer will launch this program
after a standard installation instead of Firefox or
Thunderbird, running this program with the user's
privileges.
\*
MFSA 2012-68 / CVE-2012-3975: Security researcher
vsemozhetbyt reported that when the DOMParser is used to
parse text/html data in a Firefox extension, linked
resources within this HTML data will be loaded. If the data
being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could lead
to information leakage and can potentially be combined with
other attacks to become exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-69 / CVE-2012-3976: Security researcher
Mark Poticha reported an issue where incorrect SSL
certificate information can be displayed on the addressbar,
showing the SSL data for a previous site while another has
been loaded. This is caused by two onLocationChange events
being fired out of the expected order, leading to the
displayed certificate data to not be updated. This can be
used for phishing attacks by allowing the user to input
form or other data on a newer, attacking, site while the
credentials of an older site appear on the addressbar.
\*
MFSA 2012-70 / CVE-2012-3978: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that certain security
checks in the location object can be bypassed if chrome
code is called content in a specific manner. This allowed
for the loading of restricted content. This can be combined
with other issues to become potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-71 / CVE-2012-3979: Mozilla developer Blake
Kaplan reported that \_\_android\_log\_print is called
insecurely in places. If a malicious web page used a dump()
statement with a specially crafted string, it can trigger a
potentially exploitable crash.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-72 / CVE-2012-3980: Security researcher
Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can
execute injected code with chrome privileges, leading to
the running of malicious code in a privileged context. This
allows for arbitrary code execution through a malicious web
page if the web console is invoked by the user.

Xerox Security Bulletin XRX13-003

FreeFlow Print Server v8
January 2013 Security Patch Cluster (includes Java 6 Update 37 Software)
v1.0
2/26/2013

Background

Oracle delivers quarterly Critical Patch Updates (CPU) to address US-CERT-announced Security vulnerabilities
and deliver reliability improvements to the Solaris Operating System.  Oracle no longer provides these patches
to the general public, but Xerox is authorized to deliver them to Customers with active FreeFlow Print Server
(FFPS) Support contracts (FSMA).  Customers who may have an Oracle Support Contract for their non-FFPS
Solaris  Servers  should  not  install  patches  that  have  not  been  customized  by  Xerox.  Otherwise  the  FFPS
software could be damaged and result in downtime and a lengthy re-installation service call.

This bulletin announces the availability of the following:

Note: Xerox recommends that customers evaluate their security needs periodically and if they need Security
patches  to  address  the  above  CVE  issues,  schedule  an  activity  with  their  Xerox  Service  team  to  install  this
announced Security Patch Cluster.

Applicability

These Security updates are intended for Xerox printer products running one of the FFPS 73.C0.41 or 73.B3.61
SPAR software releases.  This Security patch update has only been tested on these software releases and it is
recommended that they be installed on these FFPS software release versions.  They have not been tested with
the FFPS 73.B0.73 and 73.A3.31 software releases.

The  Xerox  CSE/Analyst  is  provided  a  tool  (accessible  from  CFO  Web  site)  that  enables  them  to  confirm  the
currently  installed  FFPS  software  release,  Security  Patch  Cluster,  and  Java  Software  version.    When  this
Security update has been installed on the FFPS system, this script will output the following:

FFPS Release Version:
FFPS Patch Cluster:
Java Version:

8.0_SP-3 (82.C5.24.86)
January 2013
Java 6 Update 37

Patch Install Methods

The  install  of  these  Security  patches  must  be  performed  by  the  Xerox  Customer  Service  Engineer  (CSE)  or
Analyst.  The customer process to obtain this Security update is to call the Xerox support number to request
the service.

Xerox strives to deliver these critical Security patch updates in a timely manner.  They are available from the
Xerox  Support  organization,  and  can  be  delivered  electronically  over  the  Internet  to  the  FFPS  system  via  a
GUI tool called the FFPS Update Manager. The other method of delivery is an FTP transfer to the FFPS system
or  writing  the  patch  cluster  to  DVD/USB  media.    A  more  detailed  description  of  the  methods  used  by  the
CSE/Analyst to install the Security patches is as follows:

FFPS Update Manager GUI

Once the Security patches are ready for customer delivery they are made available from the Xerox Edge
Host  and  Download  servers.    The  CSE/Analyst  uses  the  Update  Manager  GUI  on  the  FFPS  system  to
download  and  install  the  Security  patches  over  the  Internet.    When  the  Xerox  server  is  checked  for
updates  from  FFPS  Update  Manager,  this  Security  patch  update  is  listed  as  “January  2013  Security
Patch Cluster (FFPS v8)”.

This requires that the FFPS system be configured with the customer proxy information to gain Security
patch  update  access  from  the  Xerox  servers.    The  connection  is  initiated  by  the  FFPS  system  and  the
Xerox  servers  do  not  have  access  to  the  customer  network.    The  Xerox  server  and  FFPS  system  both
authenticate  each  other  before  a  data  transfer  can  be  successfully  established  between  the  two  end
points.

Hard Disk, DVD/USB Media

Once  the  Security  patch  updates  are  ready  for  customer  delivery  they  are  made  available  on  the  CFO
Web site.  The CSE/Analyst can download and prepare for the install by writing the Security patch update
into a well-known directory on the FFPS system, or on DVD/USB media.  The FFPS Security Patch Cluster is
delivered  as  an  ISO  image  and  ZIP  archive  file  to  provide  the  Xerox  Service  Representative  options  to
choose an install method.  Once the patch cluster has been prepared on media an install script can be run
to perform the install.  The install  script accepts an argument that identifies the media that contains a
copy of the FFPS Security Patch Cluster.  (E.g., # installSecPatches.sh [ disk | dvd | usb ]).

Important: The install of this Security patch update can fail if the archive file containing the patches is
corrupted from file transfer or writing to DVD media.  There have been reported install failures when the
archive  file  written  on  DVD  media  was  corrupt.    The  Security  patch  update  could  be  corrupted  when
writing  to  media  by  particular  DVD  burn  applications  writing  on  some  DVD  media  types.    It  is  very
important that the Security patch archive written onto the DVD install media be verified with the original
archive file that was written to DVD.

The Security patch cluster is delivered as a ZIP and an ISO file.  The file size and check sum of these files
on Windows and Solaris are as follows:

Security Patch File

Windows Size (Kb)

Solaris Size (bytes)

Solaris Checksum

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip

1,663,512

1,703,435,583

54151  3327023

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.iso

1,615,862

1,703,794,688

13849  3327724

The Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip listed on the DVD media can be verified by comparing it to
the original archive file size and checksum.  Copy this archive to a location on the FFPS system and type
‘sum  Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip’  from  a  terminal  window.    The  checksum  value  should  be
‘54151    3327023’,  and  this  validates  the  correct  January  2013  Security  Patch  Cluster  is  written  on  the
DVD.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

An update that fixes 32 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes three new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to 10.0.7ESR release, fixing a
lot of bugs and security problems.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
MFSA 2012-57: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-1971: Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse
Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew Sutherland, and
Jason Smith reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 14.
\*
CVE-2012-1970: Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse
Ruderman, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel
Holbert reported memory safety problems and crashes that
affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 14.
\*
MFSA 2012-58: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free issues using the Address Sanitizer
tool. Many of these issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution.
o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLEditor::CollapseAdjacentTextNodes CVE-2012-1972 o
Heap-use-after-free in nsObjectLoadingContent::LoadObject
CVE-2012-1973 o Heap-use-after-free in
gfxTextRun::CanBreakLineBefore CVE-2012-1974 o
Heap-use-after-free in PresShell::CompleteMove
CVE-2012-1975 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLSelectElement::SubmitNamesValues CVE-2012-1976 o
Heap-use-after-free in
MediaStreamGraphThreadRunnable::Run() CVE-2012-3956 o
Heap-buffer-overflow in nsBlockFrame::MarkLineDirty
CVE-2012-3957 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLEditRules::DeleteNonTableElements CVE-2012-3958 o
Heap-use-after-free in nsRangeUpdater::SelAdjDeleteNode
CVE-2012-3959 o Heap-use-after-free in
mozSpellChecker::SetCurrentDictionary CVE-2012-3960 o
Heap-use-after-free in RangeData::~RangeData CVE-2012-3961
o Bad iterator in text runs CVE-2012-3962 o use after free
in js::gc::MapAllocToTraceKind CVE-2012-3963 o
Heap-use-after-free READ 8 in gfxTextRun::GetUserData
CVE-2012-3964
\*
MFSA 2012-59 / CVE-2012-1956: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that it is possible to shadow the
location object using Object.defineProperty. This could be
used to confuse the current location to plugins, allowing
for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-60 / CVE-2012-3965: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a page opens a new tab,
a subsequent window can then be opened that can be
navigated to about:newtab, a chrome privileged page. Once
about:newtab is loaded, the special context can potentially
be used to escalate privilege, allowing for arbitrary code
execution on the local system in a maliciously crafted
attack.
\*
MFSA 2012-61 / CVE-2012-3966: Security researcher
Frederic Hoguin reported two related issues with the
decoding of bitmap (.BMP) format images embedded in icon
(.ICO) format files. When processing a negative "height"
header value for the bitmap image, a memory corruption can
be induced, allowing an attacker to write random memory and
cause a crash. This crash may be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-62: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover two WebGL issues. The
first issue is a use-after-free when WebGL shaders are
called after being destroyed. The second issue exposes a
problem with Mesa drivers on Linux, leading to a
potentially exploitable crash.
o
use after free, webgl fragment shader deleted
by accessor CVE-2012-3968
o
stack scribbling with 4-byte values choosable
among a few values, when using more than 16 sampler
uniforms, on Mesa, with all drivers CVE-2012-3967
\*
MFSA 2012-63: Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used
the Address Sanitizer tool to find two issues involving
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The first issue is a
buffer overflow in Gecko's SVG filter code when the sum of
two values is too large to be stored as a signed 32-bit
integer, causing the function to write past the end of an
array. The second issue is a use-after-free when an element
with a "requiredFeatures" attribute is moved between
documents. In that situation, the internal representation
of the "requiredFeatures" value could be freed prematurely.
Both issues are potentially exploitable.

CVE-2012-3970
\*
MFSA 2012-64 / CVE-2012-3971: Using the Address
Sanitizer tool, Mozilla security researcher Christoph Diehl
discovered two memory corruption issues involving the
Graphite 2 library used in Mozilla products. Both of these
issues can cause a potentially exploitable crash. These
problems were fixed in the Graphite 2 library, which has
been updated for Mozilla products.
\*
MFSA 2012-65 / CVE-2012-3972: Security research
Nicolas Gregoire used the Address Sanitizer tool to
discover an out-of-bounds read in the format-number feature
of XSLT, which can cause inaccurate formatting of numbers
and information leakage. This is not directly exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-66 / CVE-2012-3973: Mozilla security
researcher Mark Goodwin discovered an issue with the
Firefox developer tools' debugger. If remote debugging is
disabled, but the experimental HTTPMonitor extension has
been installed and enabled, a remote user can connect to
and use the remote debugging service through the port used
by HTTPMonitor. A remote-enabled flag has been added to
resolve this problem and close the port unless debugging is
explicitly enabled.
\*
MFSA 2012-67 / CVE-2012-3974: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa reported that if a crafted executable is
placed in the root partition on a Windows file system, the
Firefox and Thunderbird installer will launch this program
after a standard installation instead of Firefox or
Thunderbird, running this program with the user's
privileges.
\*
MFSA 2012-68 / CVE-2012-3975: Security researcher
vsemozhetbyt reported that when the DOMParser is used to
parse text/html data in a Firefox extension, linked
resources within this HTML data will be loaded. If the data
being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could lead
to information leakage and can potentially be combined with
other attacks to become exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-69 / CVE-2012-3976: Security researcher
Mark Poticha reported an issue where incorrect SSL
certificate information can be displayed on the addressbar,
showing the SSL data for a previous site while another has
been loaded. This is caused by two onLocationChange events
being fired out of the expected order, leading to the
displayed certificate data to not be updated. This can be
used for phishing attacks by allowing the user to input
form or other data on a newer, attacking, site while the
credentials of an older site appear on the addressbar.
\*
MFSA 2012-70 / CVE-2012-3978: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that certain security
checks in the location object can be bypassed if chrome
code is called content in a specific manner. This allowed
for the loading of restricted content. This can be combined
with other issues to become potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-71 / CVE-2012-3979: Mozilla developer Blake
Kaplan reported that \_\_android\_log\_print is called
insecurely in places. If a malicious web page used a dump()
statement with a specially crafted string, it can trigger a
potentially exploitable crash.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-72 / CVE-2012-3980: Security researcher
Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can
execute injected code with chrome privileges, leading to
the running of malicious code in a privileged context. This
allows for arbitrary code execution through a malicious web
page if the web console is invoked by the user.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2012-1970, CVE-2012-1972, CVE-2012-1973, CVE-2012-1974,
CVE-2012-1975, CVE-2012-1976, CVE-2012-3956, CVE-2012-3957, CVE-2012-3958,
CVE-2012-3959, CVE-2012-3960, CVE-2012-3961, CVE-2012-3962, CVE-2012-3963,
CVE-2012-3964)

A web page containing a malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image file
could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-3969, CVE-2012-3970)

Two flaws were found in the way Firefox rendered certain images using
WebGL. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash
or, under certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-3967, CVE-2012-3968)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox decoded embedded bitmap images in Icon
Format (ICO) files. A web page containing a malicious ICO file could cause
Firefox to crash or, under certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-3966)

A flaw was found in the way the "eval" command was handled by the Firefox
Web Console. Running "eval" in the Web Console while viewing a web page
containing malicious content could possibly cause Firefox to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2012-3980)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in the way Firefox used the
format-number feature of XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations). A web page containing malicious content could possibly
cause an information leak, or cause Firefox to crash. (CVE-2012-3972)

It was found that the SSL certificate information for a previously visited
site could be displayed in the address bar while the main window displayed
a new page. This could lead to phishing attacks as attackers could use this
flaw to trick users into believing they are viewing a trusted site.
(CVE-2012-3976)

A flaw was found in the location object implementation in Firefox.
Malicious content could use this flaw to possibly allow restricted content
to be loaded. (CVE-2012-3978)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 10.0.7 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

USN-1548-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The new package caused a

regression in Private Browsing which could leak sites visited to the

browser cache. This update fixes the problem.

Original advisory details:

Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew

Sutherland, Jason Smith, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel

Holbert discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were

tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit

these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1970](/security/CVE-2012-1970), [CVE-2012-1971](/security/CVE-2012-1971))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. If the

user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could

exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or

potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-1972](/security/CVE-2012-1972), [CVE-2012-1973](/security/CVE-2012-1973), [CVE-2012-1974](/security/CVE-2012-1974), [CVE-2012-1975](/security/CVE-2012-1975), [CVE-2012-1976](/security/CVE-2012-1976),

[CVE-2012-3956](/security/CVE-2012-3956), [CVE-2012-3957](/security/CVE-2012-3957), [CVE-2012-3958](/security/CVE-2012-3958), [CVE-2012-3959](/security/CVE-2012-3959), [CVE-2012-3960](/security/CVE-2012-3960),

[CVE-2012-3961](/security/CVE-2012-3961), [CVE-2012-3962](/security/CVE-2012-3962), [CVE-2012-3963](/security/CVE-2012-3963), [CVE-2012-3964](/security/CVE-2012-3964))

Mariusz Mlynsk discovered that it is possible to shadow the location object

using Object.defineProperty. This could potentially result in a cross-site

scripting (XSS) attack against plugins. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted

page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents or steal

confidential data within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-1956](/security/CVE-2012-1956))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered an escalation of privilege vulnerability through

about:newtab. This could possibly lead to potentially code execution with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3965](/security/CVE-2012-3965))

Frédéric Hoguin discovered that bitmap format images with a negative height

could potentially result in memory corruption. If the user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit

this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially

execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2012-3966](/security/CVE-2012-3966))

It was discovered that Firefox's WebGL implementation was vulnerable to

multiple memory safety issues. If the user were tricked into opening a

specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial

of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the

privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3967](/security/CVE-2012-3967), [CVE-2012-3968](/security/CVE-2012-3968))

Arthur Gerkis discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox's

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) implementation. If the user were tricked

into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit these to

cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute

code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3969](/security/CVE-2012-3969),

[CVE-2012-3970](/security/CVE-2012-3970))

Christoph Diehl discovered multiple memory safety issues in the bundled

Graphite 2 library. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3971](/security/CVE-2012-3971))

Nicolas Grégoire discovered an out-of-bounds read in the format-number

feature of XSLT. This could potentially cause inaccurate formatting of

numbers and information leakage. ([CVE-2012-3972](/security/CVE-2012-3972))

Mark Goodwin discovered that under certain circumstances, Firefox's

developer tools could allow remote debugging even when disabled.

([CVE-2012-3973](/security/CVE-2012-3973))

It was discovered that when the DOMParser is used to parse text/html data

in a Firefox extension, linked resources within this HTML data will be

loaded. If the data being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could

lead to information leakage and potentially be combined with other attacks

to become exploitable. ([CVE-2012-3975](/security/CVE-2012-3975))

Mark Poticha discovered that under certain circumstances incorrect SSL

certificate information can be displayed on the addressbar, showing the SSL

data for a previous site while another has been loaded. This could

potentially be used for phishing attacks. ([CVE-2012-3976](/security/CVE-2012-3976))

It was discovered that, in some instances, certain security checks in the

location object could be bypassed. This could allow for the loading of

restricted content and can potentially be combined with other issues to

become exploitable. ([CVE-2012-3978](/security/CVE-2012-3978))

Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can execute injected

code with chrome privileges, leading to the running of malicious code in a

privileged context. If the user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service

via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of

the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-3980](/security/CVE-2012-3980))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=851922#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-08-27 03:55:18 UTC  ``` Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used the Address Sanitizer tool to find two issues involving Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The first issue is a buffer overflow in Gecko's SVG filter code when the sum of two values is too large to be stored as a signed 32-bit integer, causing the function to write past the end of an array. The second issue is a use-after-free when an element with a "requiredFeatures" attribute is moved between documents. In that situation, the internal representation of the "requiredFeatures" value could be freed prematurely. Both issues are potentially exploitable.   Reference: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-63.html>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Arthur Gerkis as the original reporter of this flaw.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=851922#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-29 04:24:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1211 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1211.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=851922#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-29 04:44:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1210 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1210.html>   ``` |  |
