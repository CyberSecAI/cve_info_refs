  "CVE-2012-3969": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Gecko's SVG filter code in Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey. The vulnerability occurs when the sum of two values is too large to be stored as a signed 32-bit integer, leading the function to write past the end of an array. The issue is potentially exploitable.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when calculating buffer size in SVG filter code.",

    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "Maliciously crafted SVG files can trigger the overflow.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide the user with a malicious SVG file, usually through a website or email."
