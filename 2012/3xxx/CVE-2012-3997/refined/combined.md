Look for a full review in a bit.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=810928#c3)  Kevin Fenzi    2012-04-10 18:49:48 UTC  ``` OK - Package meets naming and packaging guidelines OK - Spec file matches base package name.  OK - Spec has consistant macro usage.  OK - Meets Packaging Guidelines.  OK - License (BSD) OK - License field in spec matches OK - License file included in package OK - Spec in American English OK - Spec is legible. OK - Sources match upstream md5sum:  OK - BuildRequires correct OK - Package has %defattr and permissions on files is good.  OK - Package has a correct %clean section.  OK - Package has correct buildroot OK - Package is code or permissible content.  OK - Packages %doc files don't affect runtime.  OK - Package has rm -rf RPM_BUILD_ROOT at top of %install  OK - Package compiles and builds on at least one arch.  OK - Package has no duplicate files in %files.  OK - Package doesn't own any directories other packages own.  OK - Package owns all the directories it creates.  OK - Package obey's FHS standard (except for 2 exceptions) See below - No rpmlint output.  See below - final provides and requires are sane.  SHOULD Items:  OK - Should build in mock.  OK - Should build on all supported archs OK - Should function as described.  OK - Should have sane scriptlets.  OK - Should have dist tag OK - Should package latest version OK - Should not use file requires outside of /etc, /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or /usr/sbin  Issues:   1. There seem to be two bundled projects in addons:   geshi - <http://qbnz.com/highlighter/> (already packaged as php-geshi) jquery - under review at [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=805587](show_bug.cgi?id=805587 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Review Request: jquery - The jQuery JavaScript Library")  Should require those and fix it work with them.   2. Probibly shouldn't Requires mysql-server. It's very likely that someone could have  their database on a remote machine and just install this on a frontend.   3. rpmlint says:   sticky-notes.src: W: invalid-url Source0: sticky-notes-20120407git.tar  Can be ignored.   4. Non package blockers, but suggestions for upstream:   - Add possiblity to use captchas on configurable kinds of pastes.  - Add possiblity to blacklist some words in pastes to block spam (Viagra, etc)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=810928#c4)  David Riches    2012-04-11 16:58:53 UTC  ``` Thanks for this!  I'm sorted for using php-geshi, but with regards to jquery...we (myself and the author) came up with another idea  basically, you can reference jquery $(latest) over the internet using:  <script type="text/javascript" src="<http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js>"></script>  For me, this works quite nicely because it doesn't rely on another dependency (I'm also not sure how much work would go into adjusting sticky-notes to suit a packaged jquery, and how far this would deviate from the upstream).  Also, sticky-notes can survive nicely without jquery - so if the box is offline, there's no real consequence  So my proposal is:  1) strip addons/ 2) use php-geshi 3) use code.jquery.com instead of a local bundle   What do you think?  Ta  Dave   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=810928#c5)  Kevin Fenzi    2012-04-11 22:31:40 UTC  ``` Well, the problem with using the remote latest jquery is that if somehow they were compromised, you could well be as well.   After talking things over with others, we currently don't require unbundling javascript... so, lets just stick with the bundled copy (Of course need to make sure and update it in the event of bugs).  Or I suppose you could just have an option to use the bundled copy or the copy from the net?  1 and 2 above seem great.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=810928#c6)  Othman Madjoudj    2012-04-11 22:49:19 UTC  ``` Month ago I contacted the author about a vulnerability, still no response.

Or is it always going to be snapshots?  If there is a release sometime like '1.0' it's going to be rpm 'older' than the date version used right now.   So, perhaps safer would be:   Version: 0.0 Release: 0.1.20120507git  Or a quick communication with upstream that they will never do a tarball/actual release.   Everything else looks good, so as soon as we sort this out we should be good to go.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=810928#c17)  Othman Madjoudj    2012-06-14 21:19:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=810928#c16)) > ok, the initial issues seem solved here, however, one thing I should have > noted before:  >  > Does upstream ever plan to release an actual release?  > Or is it always going to be snapshots? >    There's a version number in the git repo (file: VERSION), the current one is 0.3.09062012.4, I was going to use that but David already used git/date-based version.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=810928#c18)  Othman Madjoudj    2012-06-14 21:55:59 UTC  ``` Fixed the version number.
