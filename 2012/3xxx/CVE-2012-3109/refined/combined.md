## Oracle Outside In contains multiple exploitable vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#118913

Original Release Date: 2012-07-17 | Last Revised: 2014-04-28

---

### Overview

Oracle Outside In contains multiple exploitable vulnerabilities in its parsers, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| [Oracle Outside In](http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/embedded/025613.htm) is a set of libraries that can decode over 500 different file formats. Originally written by Stellent, [Outside In is now part of Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/stellent/index.html). The Oracle Outside In libraries are used by a variety of applications, including Microsoft Exchange, Google Search Appliance, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Guidance Encase Forensics, AccessData FTK, and Novell Groupwise.  Outside In versions before 8.3.7.171 and 8.3.5.6369 fail to properly handle multiple file types when the data is malformed. The file types that have vulnerable parsers are: .VSD, .WSD, .JP2, .DOC, .SXD, .LWP, .PCX, .SXI, .DPT, .PDF, .SAM, .ODG, and .CDR.The mapping of CVE identifiers to the relevant file parsers is as follows:CDR: CVE-2012-1766DOC: CVE-2012-1767DPT: CVE-2012-1768JP2: CVE-2012-1769LWP: CVE-2012-1770ODG: CVE-2012-1771PCX: CVE-2012-1772PDF: CVE-2012-1773SAM: CVE-2012-3106SXD: CVE-2012-3107SXI: CVE-2012-3108VSD: CVE-2012-3109WSD: CVE-2012-3110 |
| --- |

### Impact

| By causing an application to process a specially-crafted file with the Oracle Outside In library, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Depending on what application is using Outside In, this may happen as the result of some user interaction, such as single-clicking on a file, or it may happen with no user interaction at all. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These vulnerabilites are addressed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware [Critical Patch Update July 2012.](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujul2012-392727.html) This update provides the Outside In library versions 8.3.7.171 and 8.3.5.6369. Please also consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this and other vulnerabilities.**Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows**Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: [On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx) for more details. |

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server WebReady Document Viewing Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2740358)

Published: August 14, 2012 | Updated: November 20, 2012

**Version:** 2.2

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server WebReady Document Viewing. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution in the security context of the transcoding service on the Exchange server if a user previews a specially crafted file using Outlook Web App (OWA). The transcoding service in Exchange that is used for WebReady Document Viewing is running in the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by updating the affected Oracle Outside In libraries to a non-vulnerable version. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerabilities entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerabilities first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2737111](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2737111) for affected editions of Microsoft Exchange Server.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

## Oracle Outside In contains multiple exploitable vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Exchange Server through the WebReady Document Viewing feature. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution as Local System if a user views a specially crafted file through Outlook Web Access in a browser. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run code on the affected server, but only as LocalService. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

To view these vulnerabilities as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2012-1766](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1766), [CVE-2012-1767](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1767),[CVE-2012-1768](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1768), [CVE-2012-1769](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1769), [CVE-2012-1770](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1770), [CVE-2012-1771](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1771) , [CVE-2012-1772](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1772), [CVE-2012-1773](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-1773), [CVE-2012-3106](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3106), [CVE-2012-3107](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3107), [CVE-2012-3108](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3108), [CVE-2012-3109](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3109), and [CVE-2012-3110](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2012-3110).

#### Mitigating Factors for Oracle Outside In contains multiple exploitable vulnerabilities

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The transcoding service in Exchange that is used for WebReady Document Viewing is running in the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

#### Workarounds for Oracle Outside In contains multiple exploitable vulnerabilities

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable WebReady document view**

  1. Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
  2. Issue the following PowerShell command:

     `Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010'} | Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$False -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$False`

  **Impact of workaround.** OWA users may not be able to preview the content of email attachments.

  **How do I undo the workaround?**

  1. Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
  2. Issue the following PowerShell command:

     `Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010'} | Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$True -WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$True`

     **Note** The above steps assume the Exchange Administrator had previously allowed WebReady Documents to be viewed on both Public and Private logons to OWA. The appropriate $True or $False value should be used to set the desired behavior based upon user logon.

#### FAQ for Oracle Outside In contains multiple exploitable vulnerabilities

**What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?**

These are a remote code execution vulnerabilities.

**What causes the vulnerabilities?**

The WebReady service parses files using the Oracle Outside In libraries in order to provide a preview of the document in the browser. The vulnerabilities are caused when WebReady Document Viewer is used to preview a specially crafted file.

The mapping of CVE identifiers to the vulnerable file parsers are as follows:

**What are the Oracle Outside In libraries?**

In Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, Outlook Web App (OWA) users are provided with a feature called WebReady Document Viewing that allows users to view certain attachments as a webpage instead of relying on local applications to open/view it. The Oracle Outside In libraries are used by the conversion process in the server backend to support the WebReady feature. Microsoft licenses these libraries from Oracle.

**What is WebReady Document Viewer?**

WebReady Document Viewing allows users to view certain attachments as a webpage. Microsoft Exchange 2007 and Microsoft Exchange 2010 do the conversion, so the user doesn't need anything other than a web browser.

**What might an attacker use these vulnerabilities to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code as LocalService on the affected Exchange server. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

**How could an attacker exploit these vulnerabilities?**

An attacker could send an email message containing a specially crafted file to a user on an affected version of Exchange. When the user previews the specially crafted file in the browser, arbitrary code could be run on the Exchange server. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or take any other action that the server process has access to do.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Exchange server systems are primarily at risk from these vulnerabilities.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by updating the affected Oracle Outside In libraries to a non-vulnerable version.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had these vulnerabilities been publicly disclosed?**

For more information about the Microsoft Update Catalog, see the [Microsoft Update Catalog FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=97900).

**Detection and Deployment Guidance**

Microsoft provides detection and deployment guidance for security updates. This guidance contains recommendations and information that can help IT professionals understand how to use various tools for detection and deployment of security updates. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 961747](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/961747).

**Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates as well as common security misconfigurations. For more information, see [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=20567).

The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.

| Software | MBSA |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint | Yes |

**Note** For customers using legacy software not supported by the latest release of MBSA, Microsoft Update, and Windows Server Update Services, please see [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=20567) and reference the Legacy Product Support section on how to create comprehensive security update detection with legacy tools.

**Windows Server Update Services**

Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) enables information technology administrators to deploy the latest Microsoft product updates to computers that are running the Windows operating system. For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, see the TechNet article, [Windows Server Update Services](https://technet.microsoft.com/wsus/default.aspx).

**Systems Management Server**

The following table provides the SMS detection and deployment summary for this security update.

| Software | SMS 2003 with ITMU | System Center Configuration Manager |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint | Yes[1] | Yes[1] |

[1]The detection table described above is based on single-server Microsoft FAST Search Server 2010 for SharePoint deployments. The detection tools do not detect the applicability of the update on systems configured as part of a multiple-system FAST Search server farms.

**Note** Microsoft discontinued support for SMS 2.0 on April 12, 2011. For SMS 2003, Microsoft also discontinued support for the Security Update Inventory Tool (SUIT) on April 12, 2011. Customers are encouraged to upgrade to [System Center Configuration Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/systemcenter/bb980621). For customers remaining on SMS 2003 Service Pack 3, the [Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates](https://technet.microsoft.com/sms/bb676783.aspx) (ITMU) is also an option.

For SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates (ITMU) can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 ITMU, see [SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates](https://technet.microsoft.com/sms/bb676783.aspx). For more information about SMS scanning tools, see [SMS 2003 Software Update Scanning Tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/sms/bb676786.aspx). See also [Downloads for Systems Management Server 2003](https://technet.microsoft.com/sms/bb676766.aspx).

System Center Configuration Manager uses WSUS 3.0 for detection of updates. For more information, see [System Center](https://technet.microsoft.com/systemcenter/bb980621).

For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723): Summary list of monthly detection and deployment guidance articles.

**Note** If you have used an Administrative Installation Point (AIP) for deploying Office 2003, you may not be able to deploy the update using SMS if you have updated the AIP from the original baseline. For more information, see the **Office Administrative Installation Point** heading in this section.

**Office Administrative Installation Point**

If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system.

* For supported versions of Microsoft Office 2003, see [Creating an Administrative Installation Point](https://office.microsoft.com/ork2003/ha011401931033.aspx). For more information on how to change the source for a client computer from an updated administrative installation point to an Office 2003 original baseline source or Service Pack 3 (SP3), see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 902349](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/902349).

  **Note** If you plan to manage software updates centrally from an updated administrative image, you can find more information in the article, [Distributing Office 2003 Product Updates](https://office.microsoft.com/ork2003/ha011402381033.aspx?pid=ch011480761033).
* For creating a network installation point for supported versions of Microsoft Office, see [Create a network installation point for Microsoft Office](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179063.aspx).

  **Note** If you plan to manage security updates centrally, use Windows Server Update Services. For more information about how to deploy security updates for Microsoft Office, see the [Windows Server Update Services website](https://technet.microsoft.com/wsus/default.aspx).

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc749197) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.
