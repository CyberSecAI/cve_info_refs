Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the Oracle Outside In libraries, specifically in the parser for .VSD files. These libraries are used by various applications for decoding different file formats. When a malformed .VSD file is processed, it triggers a flaw in the parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is that the Outside In libraries fail to properly handle malformed data within VSD files. This lack of validation allows for exploitation by crafted files.
- **Memory Corruption:**  The malformed input leads to memory corruption during parsing, which can be exploited to gain control of program execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By enticing an application to process a specially crafted .VSD file, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. The code will execute with the privileges of the application using the Outside In libraries.
 - **Privilege Escalation:** If a service or application using the vulnerable library has higher privileges (like SYSTEM in the case of McAfee GroupShield), successful exploitation can lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Upload:** An attacker could upload a malicious .VSD file to a location where it would be processed by a vulnerable application or service. This could include a web server, email server, file sharing service or similar system.
- **Email Attachment:** A malicious .VSD file could be sent as an email attachment to a user of a vulnerable mail server. When a user previews the attachment, the vulnerable parsing process on the server would process the file.
- **Web Based Preview:** In the case of Microsoft Exchange, a crafted .VSD file could be included as an attachment, and when a user previews the attachment via the OWA WebReady functionality, the vulnerable parsing code will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability, meaning it can be triggered via external network connections.
- **Ability to deliver a malicious file:** The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious .VSD file to a vulnerable system. This often involves exploiting a system which allows users to upload or send files to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable systems:** The attacker needs to identify systems that use vulnerable versions of the Oracle Outside In libraries.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects various software that use the Oracle Outside In libraries, including Microsoft Exchange, FAST Search Server, and products from vendors such as McAfee, Symantec, and others.
- The provided documents specifically list multiple CVEs associated with various file types being vulnerable within the Oracle Outside In libraries, highlighting that CVE-2012-3109 is just one part of a more significant issue.
- Patches for this vulnerability were issued by Oracle in their July 2012 Critical Patch Update. Microsoft also addressed it through MS12-058 and MS12-067 security bulletins which updated the affected libraries for Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft FAST Search Server 2010 respectively.
- Workarounds are available, such as disabling WebReady document viewing in Microsoft Exchange. However, these come with a loss of functionality.
- Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) can be used to help prevent the exploitation of this and other vulnerabilities, but they are not a complete solution.
