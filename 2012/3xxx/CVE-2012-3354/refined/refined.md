Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in DokuWiki. Specifically, the `prefix` POST parameter isn't checked or cast to the correct data type (string) before being passed to PHP's `substr()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Type Confusion:** The `substr()` function expects a string as its first parameter, but the code doesn't ensure this.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** When an array (e.g., `prefix[]=1`) is passed as the `prefix` parameter, PHP throws a warning because `substr()` can't handle an array. If PHP error reporting is enabled, this warning reveals the full file path of `doku.php`, potentially disclosing sensitive information about the server's file system.
*   The code uses `cleanText` function, but does not address the type issue of `$_POST['prefix']`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can obtain the full path to the `doku.php` file on the server. This information can help with further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the DokuWiki server, setting the `prefix` parameter to an array (e.g., `prefix[]=1`).
*   **PHP Error Reporting:** The vulnerability is exploitable when PHP error reporting is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the DokuWiki server.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker can be remote

**More Details Than CVE Description:**

*   The provided content includes the specific code snippet that is vulnerable (`$PRE = cleanText(substr($_POST['prefix'], 0, -1));`), demonstrates the vulnerability with a `curl` command, and lists affected versions including "Angua (RC1), Rincewind, Anteater." It also includes a discussion of how to fix the issue, which the CVE description typically does not contain.
