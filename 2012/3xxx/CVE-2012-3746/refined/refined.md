The provided document contains security information about iOS 6, including a description of CVE-2012-3746.

**CVE-2012-3746**

*   **Root cause:** Applications using UIWebView may leave unencrypted files on the file system even when a passcode is enabled.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Inadequate data protection for files handled by UIWebView, leading to the persistence of unencrypted files on the filesystem.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the device's file system may be able to read files that were being displayed in a UIWebView. This could expose sensitive user data if the application was relying on the passcode lock for file encryption, which was not being applied to UIWebView-related files.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to gain access to the device's filesystem.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to gain access to the device's filesystem, either via physical access or a remote exploit chain.

This vulnerability is specific to applications utilizing `UIWebView` in iOS 6, where files displayed within this component were not being properly encrypted.
