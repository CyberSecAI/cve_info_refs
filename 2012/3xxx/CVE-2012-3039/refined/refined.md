- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient entropy when generating keys for SSH and SSL connections in Moxa OnCell Gateways.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  -  Insufficient Entropy (CWE-331). The devices do not use sufficient randomness when generating keys.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the gateway by calculating private authentication keys from reused or nonunique SSH and SSL host keys.
  - This could lead to reading information on the device and sending commands, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the OnCell Gateways.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Remote exploitation is possible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - An attacker with a high skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability.
