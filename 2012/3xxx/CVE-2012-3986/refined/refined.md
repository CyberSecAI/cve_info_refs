  "CVE-2012-3986": {
    "description": "Mozilla developer Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be called through script by web pages. This was addressed by adding the existing security checks to these methods.",
    "root_cause": "Several methods within DOMWindowUtils, intended for testing purposes, lacked proper security checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate security checks on DOMWindowUtils methods."
    ],
    "impact": "Bypassing intended access restrictions, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web pages could execute arbitrary script to access the vulnerable methods."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript on a vulnerable system, typically achieved via a malicious website.",
