The provided content is related to CVE-2012-3823.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application stores passwords in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Passwords are stored in plaintext, making them easily readable if accessed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can retrieve user credentials (usernames and passwords) in plaintext by accessing the `User-Edit.asp` page, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker can access the `User-Edit.asp` page.
    - The attacker uses a crafted request with a UID parameter (e.g. `http://localhost:82/User-Edit.asp?UID=1`)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application, and knowledge of the `User-Edit.asp` page. The attacker does not need authentication to access this page.
