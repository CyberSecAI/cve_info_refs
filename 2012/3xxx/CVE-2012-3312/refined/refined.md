Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the datasource definition editor within IBM InfoSphere Guardium, where it saves database login credentials, including passwords, in cleartext when the "save password" option is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data:** Passwords for configured databases are stored and transmitted without encryption when the "save password" option is activated. This exposes credentials to unauthorized access if an attacker can intercept or access this data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to database login credentials, allowing them to access or modify the affected databases, potentially leading to further compromise, data breaches, or unauthorized actions on the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** If the application transmits the cleartext credentials over a network, attackers might be able to intercept the traffic and extract the passwords.
*   **System Access:** If an attacker gains access to the system where the datasource configuration is stored, they can potentially retrieve the stored passwords.
*   **Application Vulnerability:** An attacker who can access and view the running datasource definition editor can view the exposed plain text password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to either intercept network traffic related to the datasource definition editor or gain access to the system or application where the datasource configuration data is stored or viewed.
*   No special authentication is mentioned in the bulletin, meaning an unauthenticated user could potentially access the password if they are in a position to view the application's output.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM InfoSphere Guardium versions 8.2 and earlier.
*   Patches are available through IBM Fix Central to address the issue.
*   A temporary workaround involves disabling the “save-password” option until the patch can be applied.
*   The vulnerability was reported to IBM by Positive Technologies, specifically by the Positive Research Center.
