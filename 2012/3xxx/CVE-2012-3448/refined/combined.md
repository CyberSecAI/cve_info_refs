How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-07-31 09:01:52 UTC  ``` Description A vulnerability has been reported in Ganglia, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.  The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error and can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code.  The vulnerability is reported in versions 3.1.7 through 3.5.0. Other versions may also be affected.   Solution Update to version 3.5.1. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sean Amoss (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2012-08-02 01:58:52 UTC  ``` CVE assignment per <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/08/02/1> ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2012-08-07 01:02:36 UTC  ``` CVE-2012-3448 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2012-3448>):   Unspecified vulnerability in Ganglia Web before 3.5.1 allows remote   attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via unknown attack vectors. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Kacper Kowalik (Xarthisius) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-09-02 19:48:45 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 433048](show_bug.cgi?id=433048 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - sys-cluster/ganglia-3.4 version bump") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Justin Bronder (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-09-04 03:39:09 UTC  ``` *ganglia-web-3.5.2 (04 Sep 2012)    04 Sep 2012; Justin Bronder <jsbronder@gentoo.org> +ganglia-web-3.5.2.ebuild,   +metadata.xml:   Add sys-cluster/ganglia-web to match upstream development.

Resolves #428776 >  > Thanks, Justin. So ganglia-web replaces ganglia? And are we ready to > stabilize 3.5.2?  ganglia-web replaces the web component of ganglia which had this vulnerability.  I'd like to let the two sit in the tree for a couple of weeks just to get some usage before going for stable as this is a decent sized change to how things were being packaged.  However, if the security team thinks this vulnerability should be addressed now, then I have no problem with going ahead with stabilization. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Justin Bronder (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-09-17 13:01:49 UTC  ``` Been a couple of weeks with no bugs, please feel free to go forward with stabilization. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Kacper Kowalik (Xarthisius) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-09-17 14:34:47 UTC  ``` Targets: =sys-cluster/ganglia-3.4.0 amd64 ppc x86 =sys-cluster/ganglia-web-3.5.2 amd64 ppc x86 ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Andreas Schürch   gentoo-dev  2012-09-19 05:26:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=428776#c8)) > Targets: > =sys-cluster/ganglia-3.4.0 amd64 ppc x86  There is no ganglia-3.4.0 in the tree up to now!? # ls /usr/portage/sys-cluster/ganglia ChangeLog  Manifest  files  ganglia-3.2.0.ebuild  ganglia-3.3.7.ebuild  metadata.xml ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Kacper Kowalik (Xarthisius) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-09-19 05:47:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=428776#c9)) > (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=428776#c8)) > > Targets: > > =sys-cluster/ganglia-3.4.0 amd64 ppc x86 >  > There is no ganglia-3.4.0 in the tree up to now!? > # ls /usr/portage/sys-cluster/ganglia > ChangeLog  Manifest  files  ganglia-3.2.0.ebuild  ganglia-3.3.7.ebuild  > metadata.xml  You're right.

#             will copy /etc/passwd to /tmp.
#             To modify the attack payload, modify the code below.\
# Setup     : Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS x86 with Ganglia Web Frontend 3.5.0
#
################################################################################

1. Assuming that ganglia is installed on the target machine at this path:
/var/www/html/ganglia/

2. Assuming the attacker has minimal access to the target machine and
can write to "/tmp". There are several methods where a remote attacker can
also trigger daemons or other system processes to create files in "/tmp"
whose content is (partially) controlled by the remote attacker.

3. The attacker puts the contents of this PoC file into the file:
/tmp/attack.php

4. The attacker visits the Ganglia Web Frontend interface with version < 3.5.1
as:
http://targetIP/ganglia/graph.php?g=../../../../tmp/attack&metric=DUMMY&title=DUMMY

5. Confirm that the PoC created a dummy file in the /tmp folder and copied
/etc/passwd to /tmp.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=845124#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-01 21:17:39 UTC  ``` Upstream has released Ganglia Web 3.5.1 [1] which includes a fix for a security flaw going back to 3.1.7 and possibly earlier versions.  This flaw can lead to the arbitrary execution of scripts with the privileges of the web user (apache or nobody), which could possibly lead to other compromises or data exposure.  This flaw has been fixed in upstream 3.5.1.  No further information is currently available regarding the flaw or a patch.  [1] <http://ganglia.info/?p=549>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=845124#c1)  Vincent Danen    2015-08-22 16:45:06 UTC  ``` Current Fedora and EPEL ship 3.7.1   ``` |  |

# What is Ganglia?

Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical design targeted at federations of clusters. It leverages widely used technologies such as XML for data representation, XDR for compact, portable data transport, and RRDtool for data storage and visualization. It uses carefully engineered data structures and algorithms to achieve very low per-node overheads and high concurrency. The implementation is robust, has been ported to an extensive set of operating systems and processor architectures, and is currently in use on thousands of clusters around the world. It has been used to link clusters across university campuses and around the world and can scale to handle clusters with 2000 nodes.

Ganglia is a [BSD-licensed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license) open-source project that grew out of the **University of California, Berkeley [Millennium Project](http://www.millennium.berkeley.edu/)** which was initially funded in large part by the [National Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure](http://www.npaci.edu/) (NPACI) and [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/) RI Award EIA-9802069. NPACI is funded by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/) and strives to advance science by creating a ubiquitous, continuous, and pervasive national computational infrastructure: the Grid. Current support comes from [Planet Lab](http://www.planet-lab.org/): an open platform for developing, deploying, and accessing planetary-scale services.
