```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Condor daemon does not validate that the DNS name returned by a reverse DNS lookup actually points back to the claimed IP address.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure host-based authentication",
      "Lack of forward-confirmed reverse DNS verification"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass host-based authentication and perform privileged actions, such as turning off Condor or potentially running jobs as other users.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network connection to the Condor daemon",
      "Control over the reverse DNS record of the attacker's IP address"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the reverse DNS records of their IP address and have knowledge of the target Condor site's security configuration, specifically the allowed hostnames/IPs.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in Condor installations that rely solely on host-based authentication. Deployments using stronger authentication or that don't use hostnames in authentication are not vulnerable. The issue was fixed in Condor version 7.8.2 by implementing checks to validate the DNS mapping."
