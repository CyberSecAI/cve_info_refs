## Synopsis

Moderate: dbus security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1261)

## Topic

Updated dbus packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

D-Bus is a system for sending messages between applications. It is used for
the system-wide message bus service and as a per-user-login-session
messaging facility.

It was discovered that the D-Bus library honored environment settings even
when running with elevated privileges. A local attacker could possibly use
this flaw to escalate their privileges, by setting specific environment
variables before running a setuid or setgid application linked against the
D-Bus library (libdbus). (CVE-2012-3524)

Note: With this update, libdbus ignores environment variables when used by
setuid or setgid applications. The environment is not ignored when an
application gains privileges via file system capabilities; however, no
application shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 gains privileges via file
system capabilities.

Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for
reporting this issue.

All users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct this issue. For the update to take effect, all
running instances of dbus-daemon and all running applications using the
libdbus library must be restarted, or the system rebooted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

Subject: libdbus CVE-2012-3524 fix

Hi,

As the CRD is today, and list policy requires "opening" the
distros-list posting, here is the forward.

As a quick fix, the exploit can also be mitigated by properly
placing the dbus-launch binary into the expected path, usually
"/bin/dbus-launch", e.g.

# ln -s /usr/bin/dbus-launch /bin/dbus-launch

since for some reason, on most dists the binary is mis-placed
into /usr/bin. This makes an execv() fail in libdbus itself,
triggering an execvp().

Sebastian

----- Forwarded message from Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer@...e.de> -----

Hi,

The recently discussed libdbus getenv() issue [1] turned out
to be easily exploitable on various UNIX systems, including
some Linux distributions. Common attack vectors are Xorg and
spice-gtk via auto-launching [2].
Properly patching requires fixes for libdbus and libgio,
depending on which you link your suid binaries.
Would be nice if someone from RH could forward their patch,
as they have some developers upstream and possibly access to
the private git commit (they also already assigned this CVE).
My CRD proposal is Sept. 12th. As can be seen in [1], this issue
is indeed public since 1+ year.

Sebastian

catched by spam filter.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c0)  Simon McVittie    2012-07-17 14:54:06 UTC  ``` (This issue was raised and made public on oss-sec, but for some reason not upstream. By coincidence, I was subscribed to oss-sec as a result of helping to deal with ioquake3 security.)  libdbus obeys various environment variables retrieved using getenv(). This is a potential vulnerability if a set*id application links libdbus, uses libdbus in a way that obeys environment variables, and trusts that the values of those environment variables, or the D-Bus addresses to which they point, are trustworthy.  The example cited in the Novell bug is Xorg, which is apparently setuid on SUSE, linking libhal (under at least some configurations), which uses the system bus. If Xorg makes policy decisions using PolicyKit or by calling GetConnectionUnixUser or equivalent on dbus-daemon, then a malicious user could run Xorg with DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS in its environment, connecting it to a bus that answers GetConnectionUnixUser dishonestly or contains a dishonest PolicyKit implementation, which induces it to make wrong policy decisions.  When I say "set*id" I mean setuid, setgid, or any analogous executable-based privileges that allow a caller to provide the initial environment while escalating privileges (e.g. Linux VFS capabilities).  Mitigations include:  * Most system services don't use the system bus.  * System services started by service activation (like PolicyKit itself)   never need to be setuid, because dbus-daemon-launch-helper starts them   with appropriate privileges anyway.  * System services started by init (sysvinit, systemd, Upstart or   equivalent) never need to be setuid, because their init scripts   (or equivalent) are fully-privileged anyway.  References:  <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=697105> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q3/29> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c1)  Simon McVittie    2012-07-17 15:02:28 UTC  ``` Possible resolutions include:  * Document that set*id applications must not call dbus_bus_get()   or other affected functions (either at all, or without first sanitizing   their environment). Check the set*id binaries in major distributions   to make sure they don't.  * Add a new dbus_disable_environment() and document that set*id   applications that link libdbus must call it before first use.   Check the set*id binaries in major distributions to make sure that   they either don't link libdbus, or do call dbus_disable_environment().    (I don't like this option - there shouldn't be API for "make my   application sane, please" that's off-by-default.)  * Similar to the above: stop obeying the environment in current APIs.   In cases where obeying the environment is needed, add an "opt-in"   way to do so.    (This potentially breaks working, non-setuid applications that   were relying on environment variables. In particular, many applications   rely on DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS.)  * Obey DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS (because if you're set*id, you   shouldn't be on the session bus anyway) but restrict   DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS (more rarely used, I suspect).  * Use glibc's __secure_getenv() or a new, documented equivalent, as   suggested on the oss-sec thread. This pretends the environment is   empty if the executable is detected to be privileged.   (This only protects GNU systems; it may be how glibc avoids   interpreting LD_LIBRARY_PATH for set*id binaries.)  * Reimplement something like __secure_getenv().   (In practice, this probably only protects Linux systems   with /proc mounted.)  * Use or reimplement __secure_getenv(). On non-GNU or non-Linux,   pessimistically assume we are always privileged. (Probably breaks   applications on non-GNU or non-Linux.) ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c2)  Simon McVittie    2012-07-26 12:10:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c1)) > * Document that set*id applications must not call dbus_bus_get() >   or other affected functions (either at all, or without first sanitizing >   their environment).  Maintainer consensus is that this is the case. We do not support use of libdbus in setuid binaries that do not sanitize their environment before their first call into libdbus.

In off-list discussion with the other D-Bus upstream maintainers, consensus was that binaries with greater privileges than their parent process (setuid or VFS capabilities) must not use non-trivial libraries (e.g. libdbus, libhal, GIO or any scripting language), or run other executables, without first sanitizing their environment using a "whitelist" approach (start from a blank environment, set PATH etc. to known-safe values, and copy only known-safe variables from the original environment). Resetting the environment as close as possible to the beginning of main() is wise.  In particular, we do not support use of libdbus in setuid binaries that do not sanitize their environment before their first call into libdbus. See <<http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/environment-variables.html>> for further advice.  Good examples:  * pkexec <<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/polkit/tree/src/programs/pkexec.c>> has a small whitelist of environment variables to pass through * The setuid wrapper generated by IkiWiki <<http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=IkiWiki/Wrapper.pm>> clears the environment and restores a small whitelist of CGI variables before executing user code * sudo appears to operate on a secondary environment internally, avoids non-trivial libraries, and defaults to resetting the environment from a whitelist  One maintainer specifically expressed opposition to "hardening" libdbus if it will impede running non-setuid binaries unprivileged, under a fake system bus, for regression testing. This rules out, for instance, using secure_getenv() on systems with glibc >= 2.17 and always returning NULL (i.e. assuming privilege) on other systems.  Using secure_getenv() on GNU systems and assuming *un*privileged behaviour on non-GNU is not ruled out by that consideration, but leaves non-GNU systems vulnerable. It also does not appear to address executables with escalated privileges other than set*id (e.g. Linux VFS capabilities). We believe that this makes it a poor substitute for ensuring that setuid executables clear the environment properly, which (in general) needs to be done anyway. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c3)  Colin Walters    2012-07-26 23:20:17 UTC  ``` One very minor comment: for glibc, filesystem capabilities are treated in exactly the same way as setuid.  This is because the AT_SECURE ELF aux flag is set by the kernel, and the presence of that sets __libc_enable_secure to 1.  So using __secure_getenv() should be fine for projects that want to depend on it (but libdbus is not one of those). ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c4)  Colin Walters    2012-07-28 22:27:22 UTC  ``` So this bug says that we should document that setuid executables should "clear their environment", but the question arose - would we be willing to guarantee that libdbus only looked at environment variables starting with DBUS_ ?

I would not be willing to make this guarantee, even if it was true. A whitelist is the only secure thing you can do in a set*id application, so we should not encourage people to use blacklists.  It isn't true anyway, because we (potentially) respect "standard" variables like $XDG_*, $HOME, $TMPDIR etc., because we link libraries we don't control which could respect arbitrary variables (libc), and because under some circumstances libdbus invokes dbus-launch which links more libraries we don't control (most prominently libx11). ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c6)  Colin Walters    2012-09-18 17:43:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 67345](attachment.cgi?id=67345 "Filter environment variables") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=67345&action=edit "Filter environment variables") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=52202&attachment=67345) Filter environment variables  After further investigation, it turns out there are multiple escalation vectors on different systems (via su/sudo + pam_systemd for example).

I'm pretty sure that we should not claim that libdbus (or any other non-trivial library) is safe to use in processes that are more privileged than their parent (setuid, filesystem capabilities, etc.) without first sanitizing all input from the parent - notably the environment and command-line.

The thread initialization function (whichever of dbus_threads_init() or dbus_threads_init_default() is the real implementation in this particular branch - it swapped during 1.5) is required to be called before we start our second thread, so it should call _dbus_check_setuid() for its side-effect of initializing these static variables where required, with a comment.  ::: dbus/dbus-sysdeps.c @@ +190,1 @@ >    return getenv (varname);  This should use secure_getenv() (if it exists) or __secure_getenv() (if *that* exists) or _dbus_check_setuid()+getenv().

This patch breaks the ability of bus-activated services to find their starter bus, because DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS gets cleared. (Specifically, the clear_environment function has logic to _dbus_getenv("DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS"), clear everything else, and restore it, but if _dbus_getenv fails in setuid programs, the variable never gets restored.)  Attached is a patch that fixes this by using getenv directly in the activation helper, which should be fine since clear_environment does its own filtering.  That said, I'm not sure this patch is safe. Specifically, the DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS=unixexec:... case worries me, in that it would reintroduce the vulnerability (the child of the activation helper, which is not setuid, would happily use that address). It's possible this is fine since the helper is only executable by the messagebus user?

(Using the syntax $FOO here for environment variables, even though strictly speaking it's not right, to distinguish them from the C constants that often have very similar names...)  I feel as though system-bus-activated services ought to be using dbus_bus_get (DBUS_BUS_SYSTEM, ...) anyway, but you're right that this is really a regression: it used to work, and now it doesn't.  One possible solution would be for the activation helper to set $DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS to the hard-coded, compile-time-chosen system bus address (DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_DEFAULT_ADDRESS) instead of inheriting it from the environment. The impact of this would be:  * (good) a subverted dbus-daemon can't escalate its privileges from   messagebus to root by running the setuid activation helper for a   root service (e.g. NetworkManager) with a unixexec: address that   will induce that root service to exec a chosen process  * (bad) a custom dbus-daemon (neither system nor session) configured   to use the activation helper like a system bus, but listen on an   unusual address, will pass the wrong $DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS to   its children  Mitigation of the bad: it's not at all clear to me that anyone really does this, and if they do, it doesn't work for GDBus applications anyway: passing $DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS through to GDBus applications is insufficient, because they look at $DBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE instead. If it's "session" they use $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS, if it's "system" they use GIO's compile-time-configured equivalent of DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_DEFAULT_ADDRESS, and otherwise they fail to connect at all. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c17)  Simon McVittie    2012-09-28 10:01:53 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 67810](attachment.cgi?id=67810 "activation-helper: Bypass _dbus_getenv filtering by using getenv") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=67810&action=edit "activation-helper: Bypass _dbus_getenv filtering by using getenv") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=52202&attachment=67810) activation-helper: Bypass _dbus_getenv filtering by using getenv  Review of [attachment 67810](attachment.cgi?id=67810 "activation-helper: Bypass _dbus_getenv filtering by using getenv") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=67810&action=edit "activation-helper: Bypass _dbus_getenv filtering by using getenv") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=52202&attachment=67810): -----------------------------------------------------------------  ::: bus/activation-helper.c @@ +149,4 @@ >    const char *debug_env = NULL; >   >    /* are we debugging */ > +  debug_env = getenv ("DBUS_VERBOSE");  If you're debugging the activation helper (which needs special compilation options to even *have* this code), you should be debugging a non-setuid copy, so I don't think this line of diff is necessary or desirable.

Yes; on the other hand, it's only there as a workaround for glibc not giving us a way to check this (issetugid() or equivalent) that isn't specifically flagged as non-API (__libc_enable_secure, which is GLIBC_PRIVATE). It seems rather perverse that with sufficiently new glibc, we have secure_getenv() but not issetugid(), where you have to use (something equivalent to) the latter to know whether it's safe to call execvpe()...  In fact, now I think about it more, the answer is obvious. Before we run dbus-launch, we should check that _dbus_getenv ("PATH") is non-NULL, in addition to using _dbus_check_setuid(). if it isn't, assume we're privileged, and refuse to run it (or at least, refuse to search $PATH). Similarly, before we write "keyrings" to our $HOME, we should check that _dbus_getenv ("HOME") is non-NULL, in addition to _dbus_check_setuid(). Problem solved?

Having it inherit variables that could cause it to be subverted by your unprivileged processes is pretty much equivalent to granting this capability to your entire session.

If the gnome-keyring maintainer's considered opinion is that this is OK, one way to do so would be for it to use g_dbus_connection_new_for_address() (if using GDBus) or dbus_connection_open() + dbus_bus_register() (if using libdbus) instead of the higher-level versions; then it's unambiguously gnome-keyring's responsibility to find its address, and gnome-keyring gets to make any relevant security decisions (like "actually, I trust my caller implicitly"). ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c28)  Simon McVittie    2012-10-02 08:50:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 67977](attachment.cgi?id=67977 "activation helper: when compiled for tests, do not reset  system bus address") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=67977&action=edit "activation helper: when compiled for tests, do not reset  system bus address") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=52202&attachment=67977) activation helper: when compiled for tests, do not reset  system bus address  Otherwise, the tests try to connect to the real system bus, which will often fail - particularly if you run the tests configured for the default /usr/local (with no intention of installing the result), in which case the tests would try to connect to /usr/local/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket.  ---  This was a regression caused by these changes.

Mmm...I'm uncertain about making that change to gnome-keyring.  It's true that it would help us migrate to __secure_getenv(), but on the other hand, it would be a bit of code we'd have to remember to change if we attempted to migrate to a user bus.

Any setuid/setgid executable that loads plugins that might use libdbus also needs to be "on the list".  The most prominent plugin architectures that might conceivably involve libdbus and are likely to be used by a setuid process are PAM and nss.  In particular, PAM has a history of  - being used in setuid executables, e.g. su(8)  - not documenting whether it is considered to be OK to use it in setuid   situations (e.g. no responses to   <<http://www.redhat.com/archives/pam-list/2013-January/msg00005.html>>   when I asked about this)  - people writing plugins that use D-Bus (pam_systemd, pam_ck_connector,   pam_dbus, pam_fprintd, etc.; pam_dbus and pam_fprintd use the deprecated   dbus-glib, which is particularly concerning) ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=52202#c34)  GitLab Migration User    2018-10-12 21:14:17 UTC  ``` -- GitLab Migration Automatic Message --  This bug has been migrated to freedesktop.org's GitLab instance and has been closed from further activity.

Um, I focused on the suid/daemons that we have on our dist, so theres
indeed no claim that the list of attack vectors is complete. I cannot
check any library/pam combination of any UNIX that is outthere. :)
Though, I tried to be as 'complete as possible'.
For example, you can also use su as attack vector if you run systemd
(via pam_systemd and su keeping a parent pam-session as root, triggering
pam_systemd.so load with user given environment; loading libdbus).
And finally pam_ck_connector, but AFAIS this cannot be triggered
as it only runs via login or login managers which dosn't leave room
for DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS passing so easily.
But you know, these guys are maybe more clever than us and they get more
money for their results. Thats the A in APT. :)

Ok, there is also 'nonce-tcp' which you could use to dump (parts of) secret files.
There is also the option to use a UNIX socket that you dont have write permission
to, writing semi-garbage to it (with root peer credentials), maybe triggering
actions in daemons that are 'unexpected'.

Yes, but I didnt check libgio explicitely. There might be other issues lurking inside
libgio.

Sebastian, can you confirm that this summary completely covers all your
findings?

There are problems with handling of DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment
variable in both libdbus and glib/libgio when used in a privileged
(setuid or setgid) application.

libdbus is currently tracked via CVE-2012-3524, with two known attack
variants:
- unixexec:, which is only supported in recent dbus versions (1.5+ from
  what I can see)
- autolaunch: combined with malicious PATH setting, leading to
  execution of the attacker's dbus-launch.  This affects pre-1.5 dbus
  versions too.

libgio got CVE-2012-4425:
- autolaunch: or empty address, combined with PATH setting, similar to
  the second libdbus variant

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâs CVE database.

When a technologyâenabled and most likely used by defaultâcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-10 21:26:04 UTC  ``` X.org has traditionally been suid root so that users could utilize "startx" (or similar scripts) to start X from the command line as a user.  X.org does not sanitize the environment when starting, which means it will be aware of, and pass along, environment variables.  When X.org is using the DBus backend, specifically versions 1.5.x or newer, the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is passed along to libdbus.  The DBUS system address can take a unixexec (Executed Subprocess on UNIX) transport [1] which allows one to specify a binary to execute and arguments to pass to it.  Because the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is not scrubbed by X, this environment variable is passed along to libdbus, and it specifies the address of the system message bus.  A malicious local user could use this, in conjunction with the unixexec transport, to execute arbitrary code as root (because /usr/bin/Xorg is suid root).  [1] <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#transports-exec>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c1)  Colin Walters    2012-08-11 00:03:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c0)) > X.org has traditionally been suid root so that users could utilize "startx" > (or similar scripts) to start X from the command line as a user.  X.org does > not sanitize the environment when starting,  This is slightly inaccurate - it *does* sanitize a few environment variables.  Just not ones that are problematic.  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/tree/os/utils.c?id=7f09126e068015db54c56bb982b8f91065375700#n1744>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-13 20:27:47 UTC  ``` Ahh, thanks for the clarification.  Should be rather that Xorg sanitizes a very small number of environment variables, such as LD_*.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c4)  Colin Walters    2012-08-21 15:03:22 UTC  ``` Ok, unfortunately it turns out there is another setuid binary included in Fedora at least that links to libdbus, and doesn't clear its environment:  /usr/libexec/spice-gtk-x86_64/spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper  Part of the spice-glib package.  Shipped in RHEL6 even.    This was reported by Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer>; he wrote a working exploit for Fedora 17.  It is likely possible to make it work on RHEL6 as well.  We should clone this bug, and get the spice-glib package fixed to harden its environment at a minimum.  Even better, to not link against libdbus or libgio for that matter.  Upstream for libdbus we're reconsidering our position on automatically using glibc __secure_getenv().  So it may make sense to issue a dbus update too.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c8)  Colin Walters    2012-08-21 21:06:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 606063](attachment.cgi?id=606063&action=diff "glib2: use __secure_getenv, don't run dbus-launch as root") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=606063&action=edit "glib2: use __secure_getenv, don't run dbus-launch as root") glib2: use __secure_getenv, don't run dbus-launch as root   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c9)  Colin Walters    2012-08-21 21:08:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 606064](attachment.cgi?id=606064&action=diff "dbus: Use __secure_getenv") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=606064&action=edit "dbus: Use __secure_getenv") dbus: Use __secure_getenv  This patch is from Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer>, commit message written by me.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c13)  Colin Walters    2012-08-22 00:25:19 UTC  ``` So it turns out it's a lot less lame to use glibc's __libc_enable_secure, except it was never actually exported officially.  It has always apparently worked to link to it and use it, but the RPM dependency generator (correctly) blows up now when used with new binutils.  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/owl-dev/2012/08/14/1>  Jeff, can we get that patch upstream?   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c14)  Colin Walters    2012-08-22 00:26:09 UTC  ``` See also: <http://osdir.com/ml/linux.lfs.hardened/2007-04/msg00031.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c16)  Colin Walters    2012-08-22 00:49:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 606084](attachment.cgi?id=606084&action=diff "updated glib patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=606084&action=edit "updated glib patch") updated glib patch   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c17)  Kurt Seifried    2012-08-22 06:30:18 UTC  ``` So we have a complicated CVE assignment. Basically we have three sets of issues:  1) setuid apps like startx 2) glibc getenv() / __secure_getenv() / secure_getenv() 3) libdbus versions 1.5.x or newer, the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is supported  Now taken individually none of these really represent a security boundary violation. Setuid applications are in and of themselves not a security issue. Unless an application was accidentally made setuid (e.g. an error in an RPM spec file or something) being setuid is not a CVE worthy issue. The Glibc getenv is again not in and of itself an issue typically, moving to secure_gentenv is generally a security hardening issue. Finally we have libdbus, which now supports DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS, which takes an executable as an argument. Again this is documented and intended behaviour.  So what are we to do? There is obviously a security issue present. Obviously giving a local user the ability to gain root access is not the intent of X.org/libdbus/etc.   Although the CVE dictionary typically specifies a CVE entry for a single security issue (or set of related issues) it does allow for the combination of multiple issues that individually are not serious, but in conjunction with each other can be used to violate a security boundary[CVE conjunction].   So in conjunction these issues definitely deserve a CVE. Please use [CVE-2012-3524](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3524) for this issue. Specifically in CVE description style:  Local root code execution is possible when a setuid/setgid application (such as start from X.org) using libdbus fails to properly sanitize environmental variables due to use of glibc getenv (instead of secure_getenv). This allows users to pass the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environmental variable to libdbus which takes an executable as an argument which is then run as the setuid/setgid user (such as root).   And yes any program using glibc getenv (especially those using libdbus) should be fixed to use secure_getenv.

For anything changed to use __secure_getenv, please check:   <http://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Tips_and_Tricks/secure_getenv>  as __secure_getenv should not longer be usable for use in new programs in future glibc versions.  secure_getenv should be used there instead.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c29)  Colin Walters    2012-08-23 13:32:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #28](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c28)) > (In reply to [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c20)) > > Created [attachment 606355](attachment.cgi?id=606355&action=diff "updated dbus patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=606355&action=edit "updated dbus patch") > > updated dbus patch >  > Ok, so is the plan to keep the hole open for any privileged program that > gains privileges via file system capabilities?  At the moment unfortunately yes; but I'm not aware of any fscaps binary that uses GLib.  Note that AT_SECURE is *also* set on SELinux domain transitions.  If more of userspace beyond glibc starts reacting to it, we could see more complex and subtle ramifications.  Probably mostly good - but for example, if there were a program linking to GLib today that was relying on propagating GIO_EXTRA_MODULES today to a child process or something, and there was a SELinux domain transition between them, it would stop working.  Admittedly very theoretical - but if you'd asked me earlier, I would have said polkit was the only setuid program linking to GLib...  > For anything changed to use __secure_getenv, please check: >   <http://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Tips_and_Tricks/secure_getenv>  Ah.  Well, we're not relying on __secure_getenv anymore.  What I *do* want is either: 1) __libc_enable_secure exported 2) glibc to implement issetugid() like BSD has  Apparently *very* recent glibc versions have getauxval(), so other libraries could check AT_SECURE directly, but I'd still rather have issetugid().   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c39)  Jeff Law    2012-09-06 04:40:46 UTC  ``` BTW, I'm not 100% sure why I'm cc'd on this bug.

This allows > users to pass the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environmental variable to libdbus > which takes an executable as an argument which is then run as the > setuid/setgid user (such as root).  Somewhat rewording this:  Local privilege escalation is possible when a setuid or setgid application (such as X.org X server) using libdbus 1.5.x or newer, if the application does not sanitize its environment. This allows unprivileged users to set the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environmental variable read by libdbus which can contain a command that is executed by libdbus with the application privileges.  I'd say wording it as this really implies this is a CVE for dbus.  I'm not sure if such CVE can be used for applications updates, that add proper environment filtering and hence do not only plug attack vectors via libdbus, but also similar possible (but currently unknown) problems in other libraries.  I also think that we can't use this CVE for glib fix attached here, as that fix is to make sure glib is not found to be another libdbus, offering some way to escalate privileges if used by a privileged application.  I believe we will need at least one more CVE for glib for the "privileged app used in conjunction with glib".  I think it makes sense to consider separate CVE for applications that were running privileged and were not cleaning their environments before using non-trivial libraries, in addition to this libdbus should not [*] use environment settings when running privileged CVE.  It seems less confusing.  [*] with understanding that the "should not" part can be disputed.   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c51)  Jeff Law    2012-09-07 17:38:40 UTC  ``` Ah OK.  So you just want libc_enable_secure as part of the exported ABI/API from glibc.  If so that absolutely must happen upstream; exporting additional symbols in Fedora and/or RHEL isn't possible.

Though it'd be great if you guys considered implementing issetugid() from BSD too.   ```  [Comment 55](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c55)  Colin Walters    2012-09-10 14:34:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #50](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c50)) > > I also think that we can't use this CVE for glib fix attached here, as that > fix is to make sure glib is not found to be another libdbus, offering some > way to escalate privileges if used by a privileged application.   There are two known "vulnerability pairs":  RHEL6: libdbus + Xorg RHEL7/F17: glib + spice-gtk  No objections to using separate CVEs for the pairs or for each one individually.   But glib *is* part of a vulnerability pair.  > I believe > we will need at least one more CVE for glib for the "privileged app used in > conjunction with glib".  Right.  > I think it makes sense to consider separate CVE for applications that were > running privileged and were not cleaning their environments before using > non-trivial libraries, in addition to this libdbus should not [*] use > environment settings when running privileged CVE.  It seems less confusing.  That seems reasonable to me.   ```  [Comment 58](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c58)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-13 16:52:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1261 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1261.html>   ```  [Comment 63](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c63)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-13 20:17:02 UTC  ``` Created dbus tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 857226](show_bug.cgi?id=857226 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-3524 X.org: arbitrary code execution as root when libdbus >= 1.5 is used [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 65](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c65)  Colin Walters    2012-09-13 22:47:10 UTC  ``` Adam, Hans, are you guys on the ball for doing updates on your side?

Looking at the spice-gtk side of things (upstream + fedora)   ```  [Comment 72](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c72)  Geoffrey Thomas    2012-09-28 21:25:03 UTC  ``` For the record, I'd like to note that there's a minor regression in this patchset, since dbus-daemon-launch-helper is a setuid binary that links libdbus, and does its own environment sanitization. Specifically, it attempts to pass through DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS, but that now fails, meaning a d-d-l-h-activated program won't be able to find the system bus by asking for its starter bus. (I believe there's no commonly-used software that depends on this, but it's still documented as possible and d-d-l-h clearly attempts to make it work, and my company has internal software that depended on this functionality.)  Colin Walters and I put together a patch that works around this: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/commit/?id=f68dbdc3e6f895012ce33939fb524accf31bcca5> It depends on a predecessor commit that just removes the DBUS_VERBOSE logic in the activation helper, since it's not useful.  This is in the D-Bus 1.6.8 release. I think he's decided that the regression isn't egregious enough to be worth backporting, but I figured I'd mention it in this bug anyway for future reference.   ```  [Comment 73](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c73)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-07 18:00:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c0)) > X.org has traditionally been suid root so that users could utilize "startx" > (or similar scripts) to start X from the command line as a user.  X.org does > not sanitize the environment when starting, which means it will be aware of, > and pass along, environment variables.

Note that this issue was not limited to dbus versions 1.5 and later.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The tl;dr: version if (e.g.) your Xorg binary still uses HAL and is also
setuid, ensure that it cleans its environment using a whitelist before
its first use of libdbus, libhal, any other non-trivial library, or exec().

In off-list discussion with the other D-Bus upstream maintainers,
consensus was that binaries with greater privileges than their parent
process (setuid or VFS capabilities) must not use non-trivial libraries
(e.g. libdbus, libhal, GIO or any scripting language), or run other
executables, without first sanitizing their environment using a
"whitelist" approach (start from a blank environment, set PATH etc. to
known-safe values, and copy only known-safe variables from the original
environment). Resetting the environment as close as possible to the
beginning of main() is wise.

In particular, we do not support use of libdbus in setuid binaries that
do not sanitize their environment before their first call into libdbus.
See
<<http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/environment-variables.html>>
for further advice.

Good examples:

* pkexec <<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/polkit/tree/src/programs/pkexec.c>>
has a small whitelist of environment variables to pass through
* The setuid wrapper generated by IkiWiki
<<http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=blob;f=IkiWiki/Wrapper.pm>>
clears the environment and restores a small whitelist of CGI variables
before executing user code
* sudo appears to operate on a secondary environment internally, avoids
non-trivial libraries, and defaults to resetting the environment from a
whitelist

One maintainer specifically expressed opposition to "hardening" libdbus
if it will impede running non-setuid binaries unprivileged, under a fake
system bus, for regression testing. This rules out, for instance, using
secure_getenv() on systems with glibc >= 2.17 and always returning NULL
(i.e. assuming privilege) on other systems.

Using secure_getenv() on GNU systems and assuming *un*privileged
behaviour on non-GNU is not ruled out by that consideration, but leaves
non-GNU systems vulnerable. It also does not appear to address
executables with escalated privileges other than set*id (e.g. Linux VFS
capabilities). We believe that this makes it a poor substitute for
ensuring that setuid executables clear the environment properly, which
(in general) needs to be done anyway.

Regards,
    S

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-10 21:26:04 UTC  ``` X.org has traditionally been suid root so that users could utilize "startx" (or similar scripts) to start X from the command line as a user.  X.org does not sanitize the environment when starting, which means it will be aware of, and pass along, environment variables.  When X.org is using the DBus backend, specifically versions 1.5.x or newer, the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is passed along to libdbus.  The DBUS system address can take a unixexec (Executed Subprocess on UNIX) transport [1] which allows one to specify a binary to execute and arguments to pass to it.  Because the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is not scrubbed by X, this environment variable is passed along to libdbus, and it specifies the address of the system message bus.  A malicious local user could use this, in conjunction with the unixexec transport, to execute arbitrary code as root (because /usr/bin/Xorg is suid root).  [1] <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#transports-exec>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c1)  Colin Walters    2012-08-11 00:03:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c0)) > X.org has traditionally been suid root so that users could utilize "startx" > (or similar scripts) to start X from the command line as a user.  X.org does > not sanitize the environment when starting,  This is slightly inaccurate - it *does* sanitize a few environment variables.  Just not ones that are problematic.  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/tree/os/utils.c?id=7f09126e068015db54c56bb982b8f91065375700#n1744>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-13 20:27:47 UTC  ``` Ahh, thanks for the clarification.  Should be rather that Xorg sanitizes a very small number of environment variables, such as LD_*.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c4)  Colin Walters    2012-08-21 15:03:22 UTC  ``` Ok, unfortunately it turns out there is another setuid binary included in Fedora at least that links to libdbus, and doesn't clear its environment:  /usr/libexec/spice-gtk-x86_64/spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper  Part of the spice-glib package.  Shipped in RHEL6 even.    This was reported by Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer>; he wrote a working exploit for Fedora 17.  It is likely possible to make it work on RHEL6 as well.  We should clone this bug, and get the spice-glib package fixed to harden its environment at a minimum.  Even better, to not link against libdbus or libgio for that matter.  Upstream for libdbus we're reconsidering our position on automatically using glibc __secure_getenv().  So it may make sense to issue a dbus update too.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c8)  Colin Walters    2012-08-21 21:06:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 606063](attachment.cgi?id=606063&action=diff "glib2: use __secure_getenv, don't run dbus-launch as root") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=606063&action=edit "glib2: use __secure_getenv, don't run dbus-launch as root") glib2: use __secure_getenv, don't run dbus-launch as root   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c9)  Colin Walters    2012-08-21 21:08:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 606064](attachment.cgi?id=606064&action=diff "dbus: Use __secure_getenv") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=606064&action=edit "dbus: Use __secure_getenv") dbus: Use __secure_getenv  This patch is from Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer>, commit message written by me.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c13)  Colin Walters    2012-08-22 00:25:19 UTC  ``` So it turns out it's a lot less lame to use glibc's __libc_enable_secure, except it was never actually exported officially.  It has always apparently worked to link to it and use it, but the RPM dependency generator (correctly) blows up now when used with new binutils.  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/owl-dev/2012/08/14/1>  Jeff, can we get that patch upstream?   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c14)  Colin Walters    2012-08-22 00:26:09 UTC  ``` See also: <http://osdir.com/ml/linux.lfs.hardened/2007-04/msg00031.html>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c16)  Colin Walters    2012-08-22 00:49:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 606084](attachment.cgi?id=606084&action=diff "updated glib patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=606084&action=edit "updated glib patch") updated glib patch   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c17)  Kurt Seifried    2012-08-22 06:30:18 UTC  ``` So we have a complicated CVE assignment. Basically we have three sets of issues:  1) setuid apps like startx 2) glibc getenv() / __secure_getenv() / secure_getenv() 3) libdbus versions 1.5.x or newer, the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is supported  Now taken individually none of these really represent a security boundary violation. Setuid applications are in and of themselves not a security issue. Unless an application was accidentally made setuid (e.g. an error in an RPM spec file or something) being setuid is not a CVE worthy issue. The Glibc getenv is again not in and of itself an issue typically, moving to secure_gentenv is generally a security hardening issue. Finally we have libdbus, which now supports DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS, which takes an executable as an argument. Again this is documented and intended behaviour.  So what are we to do? There is obviously a security issue present. Obviously giving a local user the ability to gain root access is not the intent of X.org/libdbus/etc.   Although the CVE dictionary typically specifies a CVE entry for a single security issue (or set of related issues) it does allow for the combination of multiple issues that individually are not serious, but in conjunction with each other can be used to violate a security boundary[CVE conjunction].   So in conjunction these issues definitely deserve a CVE. Please use [CVE-2012-3524](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3524) for this issue. Specifically in CVE description style:  Local root code execution is possible when a setuid/setgid application (such as start from X.org) using libdbus fails to properly sanitize environmental variables due to use of glibc getenv (instead of secure_getenv). This allows users to pass the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environmental variable to libdbus which takes an executable as an argument which is then run as the setuid/setgid user (such as root).   And yes any program using glibc getenv (especially those using libdbus) should be fixed to use secure_getenv.

At the moment unfortunately yes; but I'm not aware of any fscaps binary that uses GLib.  Note that AT_SECURE is *also* set on SELinux domain transitions.  If more of userspace beyond glibc starts reacting to it, we could see more complex and subtle ramifications.  Probably mostly good - but for example, if there were a program linking to GLib today that was relying on propagating GIO_EXTRA_MODULES today to a child process or something, and there was a SELinux domain transition between them, it would stop working.  Admittedly very theoretical - but if you'd asked me earlier, I would have said polkit was the only setuid program linking to GLib...  > For anything changed to use __secure_getenv, please check: >   <http://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Tips_and_Tricks/secure_getenv>  Ah.  Well, we're not relying on __secure_getenv anymore.  What I *do* want is either: 1) __libc_enable_secure exported 2) glibc to implement issetugid() like BSD has  Apparently *very* recent glibc versions have getauxval(), so other libraries could check AT_SECURE directly, but I'd still rather have issetugid().   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c39)  Jeff Law    2012-09-06 04:40:46 UTC  ``` BTW, I'm not 100% sure why I'm cc'd on this bug.

This allows > users to pass the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environmental variable to libdbus > which takes an executable as an argument which is then run as the > setuid/setgid user (such as root).  Somewhat rewording this:  Local privilege escalation is possible when a setuid or setgid application (such as X.org X server) using libdbus 1.5.x or newer, if the application does not sanitize its environment. This allows unprivileged users to set the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environmental variable read by libdbus which can contain a command that is executed by libdbus with the application privileges.  I'd say wording it as this really implies this is a CVE for dbus.  I'm not sure if such CVE can be used for applications updates, that add proper environment filtering and hence do not only plug attack vectors via libdbus, but also similar possible (but currently unknown) problems in other libraries.  I also think that we can't use this CVE for glib fix attached here, as that fix is to make sure glib is not found to be another libdbus, offering some way to escalate privileges if used by a privileged application.  I believe we will need at least one more CVE for glib for the "privileged app used in conjunction with glib".  I think it makes sense to consider separate CVE for applications that were running privileged and were not cleaning their environments before using non-trivial libraries, in addition to this libdbus should not [*] use environment settings when running privileged CVE.  It seems less confusing.  [*] with understanding that the "should not" part can be disputed.   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c51)  Jeff Law    2012-09-07 17:38:40 UTC  ``` Ah OK.

There are two known "vulnerability pairs":  RHEL6: libdbus + Xorg RHEL7/F17: glib + spice-gtk  No objections to using separate CVEs for the pairs or for each one individually.

Specifically, it attempts to pass through DBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS, but that now fails, meaning a d-d-l-h-activated program won't be able to find the system bus by asking for its starter bus. (I believe there's no commonly-used software that depends on this, but it's still documented as possible and d-d-l-h clearly attempts to make it work, and my company has internal software that depended on this functionality.)  Colin Walters and I put together a patch that works around this: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/commit/?id=f68dbdc3e6f895012ce33939fb524accf31bcca5> It depends on a predecessor commit that just removes the DBUS_VERBOSE logic in the activation helper, since it's not useful.  This is in the D-Bus 1.6.8 release. I think he's decided that the regression isn't egregious enough to be worth backporting, but I figured I'd mention it in this bug anyway for future reference.   ```  [Comment 73](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c73)  Tomas Hoger    2012-10-07 18:00:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=847402#c0)) > X.org has traditionally been suid root so that users could utilize "startx" > (or similar scripts) to start X from the command line as a user.

Subject: libdbus hardening

Hi,

We are going to add a libdbus hardening patch:

<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=697105>

This is because some suid binaries (Xorg and others) are linked against libdbus and
it seems not right to allow users to route polkit or other
system messages to a fake dbusd via $DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS.

If anyone has a better patch or something even easier, just let us know.

There are certainly also other libs that will receive a patch.

Sebastian

# USN-1576-2: DBus regressions

4 October 2012

DBus could be made to run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [dbus](/security/cves?package=dbus) - simple interprocess messaging system

## Details

USN-1576-1 fixed vulnerabilities in DBus. The update caused a regression

for certain services launched from the activation helper, and caused an

unclean shutdown on upgrade. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that DBus incorrectly handled environment

variables when running with elevated privileges. A local attacker could
