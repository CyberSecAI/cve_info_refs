{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2012-3524",
    "description": "DBus incorrectly handled environment variables when running with elevated privileges. A local attacker could possibly exploit this flaw with a setuid binary and gain root privileges.",
    "affected_components": [
      "dbus"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The D-Bus library honored environment settings even when running with elevated privileges.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of environment variables in setuid/setgid programs using libdbus, allowing for privilege escalation.",
      "Use of `getenv()` instead of `secure_getenv()` or similar secure alternatives in libdbus when handling environment variables for setuid/setgid processes."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges, by setting specific environment variables before running a setuid or setgid application linked against the D-Bus library (libdbus), gaining root access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting setuid/setgid programs linked against vulnerable versions of libdbus.",
      "Manipulation of the `DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS` environment variable to execute arbitrary code.",
      "Using the 'autolaunch:' bus address combined with a malicious PATH setting.",
       "Using the 'unixexec:' bus address to point to a malicious program."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Local access to the system",
      "Ability to set environment variables"
    ],
    "additional_info": [
        "The vulnerability is present in how dbus handles environment variables passed to it.",
        "The issue is not limited to dbus versions 1.5 and later. Older versions can be exploited as well.",
        "The vulnerability is present when certain setuid binaries (like Xorg, spice-gtk, or others that uses dbus) do not sanitize the environment before using dbus.",
         "This issue is also related to glib and libgio, where `getenv()` is used in a similar unsafe way.",
         "Proper patching requires fixes for libdbus and libgio, depending on which is linked against suid binaries.",
         "Mitigation involves sanitizing the environment before using dbus in setuid binaries.",
          "It was also noted that it is safer to check if `_dbus_getenv(\"PATH\")` is non-NULL, before using dbus-launch.",
           "Similarly, before writing to `$HOME`, a check should be done to confirm `_dbus_getenv(\"HOME\")` is non-NULL."
