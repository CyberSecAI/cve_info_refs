    {
      "cve": "CVE-2012-3301",
      "vulnerability": "HTTP Response Splitting",
      "description": "The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper sanitization of user input when constructing HTTP responses. By injecting newline characters (%0A) into the URL, an attacker can insert arbitrary headers into the response. This can be exploited to cause various issues, such as session hijacking, cache poisoning or redirecting the victim to an attacker-controlled page.",
       "attack_vector": "The attack is performed via a crafted URL containing the newline character (%0A) followed by the malicious header.",
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary headers into the response, which can lead to session hijacking, cache poisoning, or redirection to a malicious site.",
      "weakness": "Improper sanitization of user-controlled input when constructing HTTP responses.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the newline character (%0A). No special privileges are required"

    {
      "cve": "CVE-2012-3301",
      "vulnerability": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "description": "Multiple XSS vulnerabilities were discovered in IBM Lotus Domino. The first XSS example is triggered by using the Refresh header with javascript: URL, which allows executing arbitrary JavaScript code. The second example bypasses the same origin policy using the data: URI with a base64-encoded script. Also, the Location header and vbscript: URI could be used for XSS attacks.",
        "attack_vector": "The attack is performed via a crafted URL containing malicious javascript inside the Refresh header or a data/vbscript URI.",
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.",
      "weakness": "Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input when generating HTML and HTTP headers.",
       "required_capabilities":"The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious javascript or data/vbscript URI. No special privileges are required"
