  "CVE-2012-3401": {
    "description": "The tiff2pdf utility incorrectly handled certain malformed TIFF images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
    "root_cause": "The tiff2pdf tool had a heap-based buffer overflow flaw due to improper initialization of the T2P context struct pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
        "Improper initialization of T2P context struct pointer"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by crashing the application or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running tiff2pdf.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted TIFF image file, that when processed by tiff2pdf, would lead to a crash or potential code execution.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious TIFF image and get the victim to process it with the vulnerable tiff2pdf utility.",
