# USN-1511-1: tiff vulnerability

19 July 2012

tiff2pdf could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened
a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [tiff](/security/cves?package=tiff) - Tag Image File Format (TIFF) library

## Details

Huzaifa Sidhpurwala discovered that the tiff2pdf utility incorrectly

handled certain malformed TIFF images. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker

could crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-09-25 08:58:59 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libtiff, library for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, processed certain TIFF images using PixarLog Compression format. An attacker could create a specially-crafted TIFF image that, when opened, could cause an application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-09-25 09:01:45 UTC  ``` This issue was partly fixed in the libtiff-4.0.2 release via the following commit:  revision 1.37 date: 2012-05-24 23:21:45 +0000;  author: fwarmerdam;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2;  commitid: 5xHvb7ZoNW8P226w; Allocate working buffer one word larger since we "forward accumulate" and overwrite the end by one word in at least some cases.   and later seems to be completely resolved in libtiff-4.0.3 via the following commit:  revision 1.38 date: 2012-06-21 01:01:53 +0000;  author: fwarmerdam;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -2;  commitid: i91tq45sntOmJv9w; make tbuf large enough for one stride past the end   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=860198#c3)  Huzaifa S.

## Synopsis

Moderate: libtiff security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1590)

## Topic

Updated libtiff packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
Image File Format (TIFF) files.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libtiff processed
certain TIFF images using the Pixar Log Format encoding. An attacker could
create a specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, could cause an
application using libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-4447)

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libtiff handled
DOTRANGE tags. An attacker could use this flaw to create a
specially-crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application
linked against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-5581)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the tiff2pdf tool. An
attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted TIFF file that
would cause tiff2pdf to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-3401)

A missing return value check flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow,
was found in the ppm2tiff tool. An attacker could use this flaw to create a
specially-crafted PPM (Portable Pixel Map) file that would cause ppm2tiff
to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-4564)

The CVE-2012-5581, CVE-2012-3401, and CVE-2012-4564 issues were discovered
by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team.

All libtiff users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to resolve these issues. All running applications linked
against libtiff must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Subject: tiff2pdf: Heap-based buffer overflow due to improper initialization
 of T2P context struct pointer

Hi All,

I found the following flaw in the tiff2pdf tool, shipped with libtiff:

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF
image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of
functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format
files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF
document file, when not properly initialized T2P context struct pointer
has been provided by tiff2pdf (application requesting the conversion)
as one of parameters for the routine performing the write. A remote
attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that
when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash or,
potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
running the tiff2pdf binary.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2012-3401.

Reference:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=837577>

The relevant patch for the issue has been applied to upstream
libtiff-4.0.2 branch

Thanks!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-04 10:01:43 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF document file, when not properly initialized T2P context struct pointer has been provided by tiff2pdf (application requesting the conversion) as one of parameters for the routine performing the write. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the tiff2pdf binary.   Issue found by: Huzaifa Sidhpurwala, Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c15)  Tom Lane    2012-07-18 15:13:42 UTC  ``` I have pushed the patches attached to this BZ into upstream libtiff CVS.  They don't seem to have a cvsweb server, but instructions for anonymous CVS access are at <http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c16)  Huzaifa S.

How about quoting code instead of expecting me > to guess?  Taking my cues from your patch, I looked at v4.0.2.  Below is the extract from t2p_process_ojpeg_tables() which I referred to:  3159					t2p->t2p_error = T2P_ERR_ERROR; 3160					return(0); 3161			} 3162			if(!TIFFGetField(input, TIFFTAG_JPEGPOINTTRANSFORM, &pt)){ 3163				TIFFError(TIFF2PDF_MODULE,  3164					"Missing JPEGPointTransform field in OJPEG image %s",  3165					TIFFFileName(input)); 3166					t2p->t2p_error = T2P_ERR_ERROR; 3167				return(0); 3168			} 3169		} 3170		if(!TIFFGetField(input, TIFFTAG_YCBCRSUBSAMPLING, &h_samp, &v_samp)){ 3171			h_samp=1; 3172			v_samp=1; 3173		} 3174		if(t2p->pdf_ojpegdata != NULL){ 3175			_TIFFfree(t2p->pdf_ojpegdata); 3176			t2p->pdf_ojpegdata=NULL; 3177		}  3178		t2p->pdf_ojpegdata = _TIFFmalloc(2048); 3179		if(t2p->pdf_ojpegdata == NULL){ 3180			TIFFError(TIFF2PDF_MODULE,  3181				"Can't allocate %u bytes of memory for t2p_process_ojpeg_tables, %s",  3182				2048,  3183				TIFFFileName(input)); 3184			return(0); 3185		}   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c23)  Tom Lane    2012-07-19 15:48:30 UTC  ``` Yeah, you're right, that should set t2p_error --- and looking through the file, I found a similar oversight in t2p_write_pdf().  These cases do not have any security content though, because AFAICS nothing will crash if pdf_ojpegdata (or pdf_xrefoffsets in the other place) is left null.  You might get a bogus additional error message, and/or failure to exit(1) as desired, but no worse.  I've pushed those fixes into upstream CVS, so they will be in the next releases, but I don't think they should be considered part of the CVE issue.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c24)  Huzaifa S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-04 10:01:43 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF document file, when not properly initialized T2P context struct pointer has been provided by tiff2pdf (application requesting the conversion) as one of parameters for the routine performing the write. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the tiff2pdf binary.   Issue found by: Huzaifa Sidhpurwala, Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c15)  Tom Lane    2012-07-18 15:13:42 UTC  ``` I have pushed the patches attached to this BZ into upstream libtiff CVS.  They don't seem to have a cvsweb server, but instructions for anonymous CVS access are at <http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c16)  Huzaifa S.

How about quoting code instead of expecting me > to guess?  Taking my cues from your patch, I looked at v4.0.2.  Below is the extract from t2p_process_ojpeg_tables() which I referred to:  3159					t2p->t2p_error = T2P_ERR_ERROR; 3160					return(0); 3161			} 3162			if(!TIFFGetField(input, TIFFTAG_JPEGPOINTTRANSFORM, &pt)){ 3163				TIFFError(TIFF2PDF_MODULE,  3164					"Missing JPEGPointTransform field in OJPEG image %s",  3165					TIFFFileName(input)); 3166					t2p->t2p_error = T2P_ERR_ERROR; 3167				return(0); 3168			} 3169		} 3170		if(!TIFFGetField(input, TIFFTAG_YCBCRSUBSAMPLING, &h_samp, &v_samp)){ 3171			h_samp=1; 3172			v_samp=1; 3173		} 3174		if(t2p->pdf_ojpegdata != NULL){ 3175			_TIFFfree(t2p->pdf_ojpegdata); 3176			t2p->pdf_ojpegdata=NULL; 3177		}  3178		t2p->pdf_ojpegdata = _TIFFmalloc(2048); 3179		if(t2p->pdf_ojpegdata == NULL){ 3180			TIFFError(TIFF2PDF_MODULE,  3181				"Can't allocate %u bytes of memory for t2p_process_ojpeg_tables, %s",  3182				2048,  3183				TIFFFileName(input)); 3184			return(0); 3185		}   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c23)  Tom Lane    2012-07-19 15:48:30 UTC  ``` Yeah, you're right, that should set t2p_error --- and looking through the file, I found a similar oversight in t2p_write_pdf().  These cases do not have any security content though, because AFAICS nothing will crash if pdf_ojpegdata (or pdf_xrefoffsets in the other place) is left null.  You might get a bogus additional error message, and/or failure to exit(1) as desired, but no worse.  I've pushed those fixes into upstream CVS, so they will be in the next releases, but I don't think they should be considered part of the CVE issue.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=837577#c24)  Huzaifa S.

Debian Bug     : 678140

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Tiff, a library set and tools
to support the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), allowing denial of service and
potential privilege escalation.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited via a specially crafted TIFF image.

CVE-2012-2113
  The tiff2pdf utility has an integer overflow error when parsing images.

CVE-2012-3401
  Huzaifa Sidhpurwala discovered heap-based buffer overflow in the
  t2p_read_tiff_init() function.

CVE-2010-2482
  An invalid td_stripbytecount field is not properly handle and can trigger a
  NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2010-2595
  An array index error, related to "downsampled OJPEG input." in the
  TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function causes an unexpected crash.

CVE-2010-2597
  Also related to "downsampled OJPEG input", the TIFFVStripSize function crash
  unexpectly.

CVE-2010-2630
  The TIFFReadDirectory function does not properly validate the data types of
  codec-specific tags that have an out-of-order position in a TIFF file.

CVE-2010-4665
  The tiffdump utility has an integer overflow in the ReadDirectory function.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

Xerox Security Bulletin XRX13-003

FreeFlow Print Server v8
January 2013 Security Patch Cluster (includes Java 6 Update 37 Software)
v1.0
2/26/2013

Background

Oracle delivers quarterly Critical Patch Updates (CPU) to address US-CERT-announced Security vulnerabilities
and deliver reliability improvements to the Solaris Operating System.  Oracle no longer provides these patches
to the general public, but Xerox is authorized to deliver them to Customers with active FreeFlow Print Server
(FFPS) Support contracts (FSMA).  Customers who may have an Oracle Support Contract for their non-FFPS
Solaris  Servers  should  not  install  patches  that  have  not  been  customized  by  Xerox.  Otherwise  the  FFPS
software could be damaged and result in downtime and a lengthy re-installation service call.

This bulletin announces the availability of the following:

Note: Xerox recommends that customers evaluate their security needs periodically and if they need Security
patches  to  address  the  above  CVE  issues,  schedule  an  activity  with  their  Xerox  Service  team  to  install  this
announced Security Patch Cluster.

Applicability

These Security updates are intended for Xerox printer products running one of the FFPS 73.C0.41 or 73.B3.61
SPAR software releases.  This Security patch update has only been tested on these software releases and it is
recommended that they be installed on these FFPS software release versions.  They have not been tested with
the FFPS 73.B0.73 and 73.A3.31 software releases.

The  Xerox  CSE/Analyst  is  provided  a  tool  (accessible  from  CFO  Web  site)  that  enables  them  to  confirm  the
currently  installed  FFPS  software  release,  Security  Patch  Cluster,  and  Java  Software  version.    When  this
Security update has been installed on the FFPS system, this script will output the following:

FFPS Release Version:
FFPS Patch Cluster:
Java Version:

8.0_SP-3 (82.C5.24.86)
January 2013
Java 6 Update 37

Patch Install Methods

The  install  of  these  Security  patches  must  be  performed  by  the  Xerox  Customer  Service  Engineer  (CSE)  or
Analyst.  The customer process to obtain this Security update is to call the Xerox support number to request
the service.

Xerox strives to deliver these critical Security patch updates in a timely manner.  They are available from the
Xerox  Support  organization,  and  can  be  delivered  electronically  over  the  Internet  to  the  FFPS  system  via  a
GUI tool called the FFPS Update Manager. The other method of delivery is an FTP transfer to the FFPS system
or  writing  the  patch  cluster  to  DVD/USB  media.    A  more  detailed  description  of  the  methods  used  by  the
CSE/Analyst to install the Security patches is as follows:

FFPS Update Manager GUI

Once the Security patches are ready for customer delivery they are made available from the Xerox Edge
Host  and  Download  servers.    The  CSE/Analyst  uses  the  Update  Manager  GUI  on  the  FFPS  system  to
download  and  install  the  Security  patches  over  the  Internet.    When  the  Xerox  server  is  checked  for
updates  from  FFPS  Update  Manager,  this  Security  patch  update  is  listed  as  “January  2013  Security
Patch Cluster (FFPS v8)”.

This requires that the FFPS system be configured with the customer proxy information to gain Security
patch  update  access  from  the  Xerox  servers.    The  connection  is  initiated  by  the  FFPS  system  and  the
Xerox  servers  do  not  have  access  to  the  customer  network.    The  Xerox  server  and  FFPS  system  both
authenticate  each  other  before  a  data  transfer  can  be  successfully  established  between  the  two  end
points.

Hard Disk, DVD/USB Media

Once  the  Security  patch  updates  are  ready  for  customer  delivery  they  are  made  available  on  the  CFO
Web site.  The CSE/Analyst can download and prepare for the install by writing the Security patch update
into a well-known directory on the FFPS system, or on DVD/USB media.  The FFPS Security Patch Cluster is
delivered  as  an  ISO  image  and  ZIP  archive  file  to  provide  the  Xerox  Service  Representative  options  to
choose an install method.  Once the patch cluster has been prepared on media an install script can be run
to perform the install.  The install  script accepts an argument that identifies the media that contains a
copy of the FFPS Security Patch Cluster.  (E.g., # installSecPatches.sh [ disk | dvd | usb ]).

Important: The install of this Security patch update can fail if the archive file containing the patches is
corrupted from file transfer or writing to DVD media.  There have been reported install failures when the
archive  file  written  on  DVD  media  was  corrupt.    The  Security  patch  update  could  be  corrupted  when
writing  to  media  by  particular  DVD  burn  applications  writing  on  some  DVD  media  types.    It  is  very
important that the Security patch archive written onto the DVD install media be verified with the original
archive file that was written to DVD.

The Security patch cluster is delivered as a ZIP and an ISO file.  The file size and check sum of these files
on Windows and Solaris are as follows:

Security Patch File

Windows Size (Kb)

Solaris Size (bytes)

Solaris Checksum

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip

1,663,512

1,703,435,583

54151  3327023

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.iso

1,615,862

1,703,794,688

13849  3327724

The Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip listed on the DVD media can be verified by comparing it to
the original archive file size and checksum.  Copy this archive to a location on the FFPS system and type
‘sum  Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip’  from  a  terminal  window.    The  checksum  value  should  be
‘54151    3327023’,  and  this  validates  the  correct  January  2013  Security  Patch  Cluster  is  written  on  the
DVD.

# libTIFF: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201209-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could result in execution of
arbitrary code or Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.2-r1**revision >= **3.9.5-r2**revision >= **3.9.7-r1** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image
File Format) images.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libTIFF. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF 4.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-4.0.2-r1"

```

All libTIFF 3.9 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.9.5-r2"

```
