{
  "CVE-2012-3405": {
    "description": "The formatted printing functionality in glibc used extend_alloca() incorrectly. A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted sequence of format specifiers, leading to a desynchronization within the buffer size handling, resulting in the use of uninitialized memory or, potentially, FORTIFY_SOURCE format string protection mechanism bypass, when processed.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect use of `extend_alloca()` in glibc's formatted printing functionality. The `nspecs_max` variable is modified by extend_alloca when allocating memory, leading to desynchronization in buffer size handling.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory allocation size calculation",
       "Use of uninitialized memory",
      "Potential bypass of FORTIFY_SOURCE format string protection"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a crash, use of uninitialized memory, or potentially bypass the FORTIFY_SOURCE format string protection mechanism.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack vector through specially crafted format specifiers"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control or influence format specifiers passed to a vulnerable function utilizing glibc's formatted printing."
