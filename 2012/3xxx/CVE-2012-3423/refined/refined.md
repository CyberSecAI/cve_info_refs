{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The IcedTea-Web browser plugin incorrectly assumed that strings received from the browser were null-terminated. This assumption was incorrect, and browsers could send non-null-terminated strings, which caused the plugin to read or write past the end of the buffer when handling them.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of strings",
      "Buffer Over-read",
	  "Buffer Over-write"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause the web browser to crash (denial of service) or possibly execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious Java applet embedded in a web page. Information leak is also possible.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious web page with a specially crafted Java applet to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a web page that an end user visits with a vulnerable browser.  No other capabilities are needed"
