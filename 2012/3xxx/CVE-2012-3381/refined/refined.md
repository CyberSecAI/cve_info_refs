Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-3381

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the `/etc/init.d/sfcb` init script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The script prepends `/usr/lib` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable: `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
*   If the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is empty, this effectively makes binaries use libraries from the current directory.
*   The vulnerability arises when an administrator starts the `sfcb` service from an untrusted directory, potentially leading to the loading of malicious libraries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious library in the current directory from which the `sfcb` service is started.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves starting the `sfcb` service from a directory where the attacker has placed a malicious library.
*   The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is manipulated to include the current directory, causing the system to load the attacker's library instead of the intended one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to place a malicious library in a directory from which an administrator might start the `sfcb` service.
*   The attacker also needs a user with the necessary permissions to start the sfcb service

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered low severity by Red Hat Product Security.
*   The issue was not addressed in future updates, marked as WONTFIX for some affected systems.
*   The vulnerability was found via grep.
*   The init script was removed in sblim-sfcb-1.3.14-2 for Fedora 17, therefore not affected.
