  "CVE-2012-3968": {
    "description": "Security researcher **miaubiz** used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover two WebGL issues. The first issue is a use-after-free when WebGL shaders are called after being destroyed. The second issue exposes a problem with Mesa drivers on Linux, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "Use-after-free vulnerability when WebGL shaders are called after being destroyed. The binding code creates an array for the return value of getAttachedShaders, and setting the first item of the array calls deleteShader on the second shader in the list due to a setter function present in the prototype.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service via application crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted page can trigger the use-after-free by manipulating shader deletion and access patterns in WebGL.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into loading a malicious web page."
