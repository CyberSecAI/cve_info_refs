  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Multiple Stored (Persistent) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities",
    "Multiple Reflected (Non-Persistent) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities",
    "Path disclosure issues"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session or disclose the full installation path of the affected CMS.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "GET requests",
    "POST requests"
  ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted GET/POST requests to the vulnerable application. For stored XSS, they need to be authenticated in order to inject malicious payloads."
