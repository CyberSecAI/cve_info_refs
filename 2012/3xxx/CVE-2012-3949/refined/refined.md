The provided content is related to CVE-2012-3949.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A vulnerability exists in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco Unified Communications Manager. This vulnerability is triggered when an affected device processes a crafted SIP message containing a valid Session Description Protocol (SDP) message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the processing of crafted SIP messages with valid SDP messages.
- Affected devices are vulnerable when configured to process SIP messages and when SDP pass-through is enabled.
- The vulnerability is triggered by traffic destined to the device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause the affected device to reload (Cisco IOS/IOS XE) or cause a critical service to fail, interrupting voice services (Cisco Unified Communications Manager).
- Denial of Service (DoS) leading to service disruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted SIP message containing a valid SDP message to an affected device.
- The attacker must be able to reach the device's SIP interface (port 5060 UDP/TCP or 5061 TLS).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected device.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted SIP messages to the targeted device.
- For TCP transport, a three-way handshake is necessary prior to sending the malicious payload.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects Cisco devices running specific versions of Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
- SDP pass-through needs to be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
- Workarounds include disabling SIP processing or disabling SDP pass-through, and using Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to block SIP traffic from untrusted sources.
- Fixed software versions are provided for various Cisco products.
- The vulnerability was found during troubleshooting of TAC service requests.
