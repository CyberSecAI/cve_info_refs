Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3472:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authentication checks on certain API calls within the Ushahidi platform. Specifically, the comments, reports, and email APIs were accessible without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of authentication requirements for specific API endpoints. This allows unauthenticated users to potentially perform actions that should be restricted to authorized users.
*   **Insufficient access control:** The system failed to verify if a user was logged in and had the necessary permissions before allowing access to certain functionalities.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized access to comments:** An attacker could potentially manipulate or delete comments without being logged in, causing disruptions.
*   **Unauthorized access to reports:** An attacker could potentially submit, modify, or delete reports without authentication.
*  **Unauthorized access to email API:** An attacker could potentially access, read, and manipulate emails through the API without proper authentication.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct API requests:** The vulnerability could be exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests directly to the vulnerable API endpoints.
*   **Unauthenticated API access:** No login or authentication is needed to perform the actions on the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the Ushahidi platform in order to send API requests to the server.
*   **Knowledge of API endpoints:** The attacker would need some knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoints to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided content includes commit logs which detail the fixes applied to address this vulnerability.
    *   Commit `4c24325` addresses the missing authentication in the email API.
    *   Commit `f67f4ad` adds authentication requirements for comment actions such as spam, pending, and other actions
*   The commits show that the fix implemented involved adding an authentication check using `$this->api_service->_login(TRUE)` before allowing access to the vulnerable API functionalities.
