Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-3449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `openvswitch-pki` package creates two directories, `/var/lib/openvswitch/pki/controllerca/incoming` and `/var/lib/openvswitch/pki/switchca/incoming`, with world-writable permissions (drwx-wx-wx) during installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Permissions:** The world-writable permissions on the "incoming" directories allow any local user to write to these directories.
- **File Manipulation:** Although a regular user cannot list the contents, they can still overwrite or delete files within these directories if they can guess or derive the filenames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Deletion/Overwrite:** Local users could delete or overwrite arbitrary files within the vulnerable directories.
- **Potential for Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially crash the program or cause a DoS by manipulating the files, such as forcing it to append or process huge files.
- **Stashing Files:** Attackers could use the directories to store files, which are typically not expected by the admin.
- **Covering up Attacks:** The ability to modify files could also be used to cover up attack activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users who have access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a regular user account on the affected system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Ability to Guess/Derive Filenames:** The attacker would need to be able to guess or derive the filenames of files within the "incoming" directories to delete or overwrite them.
