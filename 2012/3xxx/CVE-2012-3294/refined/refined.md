Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-3294

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

**Affected Product:** IBM WebSphere MQ File Transfer Edition Web Gateway and WebSphere MQ - Managed File Transfer. Specifically versions 7.0.4 and all previous versions.

**Root Cause:** The web interface of the Web Gateway component lacks sufficient protection against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in user's browser into sending malicious requests to the server.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms in the Web Gateway component.
*   The application does not validate the origin of requests, allowing requests originating from a malicious website to be processed as if they came from an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious user can add userspace and define quota.
*   A malicious user can change permissions on existing userspaces.
*   A malicious user can add MQ Message Descriptor (MQMD) user IDs.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing form submissions that target the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker induces a logged-in user to visit the malicious page, which automatically submits the crafted requests to the vulnerable web application. This can be done via social engineering or by hosting the malicious page on a website the user visits.
*  The attack is performed via an HTML form using POST method

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable application's API endpoints and request parameters to be able to craft malicious HTML.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to induce a logged-in user to visit their malicious HTML page.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit examples provided show HTML forms using the POST method to submit forged requests. These forms target the following endpoints of the vulnerable application:
*   `/wmqfteconsole/Filespaces` to add a new userspace and define quota.
*   `/wmqfteconsole/FileSpacePermisssions` to change permissions on a filespace.
*   `/wmqfteconsole/UploadUsers` to add MQMD user IDs.

The exploit examples use hidden input fields to specify the required parameters to perform the actions, such as `name`, `quota`, `user`, `write`, `userID`, `mqmdUserID`. The `nirvcsrf` parameter, which appears to be a placeholder, shows a lack of a proper CSRF token validation mechanism.
