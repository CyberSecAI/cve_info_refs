# Security Bulletin: Tivoli Federated Identity Manager - Passwords exposed in trace files (CVE-2012-3310)

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

SUMMARY

## Content

**VULNERABILITY DETAILS**

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-3310

**DESCRIPTION:**

The four logging configurations described below result in the TFIM trace files containing passwords that are either in clear text or obfuscated in a manner that the password can be derived. In all cases, accessing the configuration of the system in order to enable the logging, as well as accessing the resulting trace files, requires elevated privileges.

1) ALIAS SERVICE SETTINGS

Enabling the "all" TFIM log trace setting results in the Alias Service Settings LDAP "Bind Password" to appear in clear text in the resulting log files upon execution of SAML 2.0 Single Sign On flow.

2) VIEWING KEYSTORES

Enabling the "all" TFIM log trace setting results in obfuscated keystore passwords being logged upon "View Keys" execution in TFIM configuration.

3) ARTIFACT FEDERATION SINGLE SIGN ON WITH BASIC AUTHENTICATION

Enabling the "all" TFIM log trace setting results in the client Basic Authentication password being logged in clear text upon execution of SAML 2.0 Federation SSO flow using HTTP-Artifact.

4) STS MODULE USERNAMETOKEN

Enabling the "all" TFIM log trace setting results in the end-user supplied password being logged in clear text when issuing the UsernameToken.

An attack does not require local network access, but it does it require authentication and specialized knowledge and techniques. An exploit will not impact accessibility of system resources or the integrity of information, but the confidentiality of some of the data managed by TFIM could be compromised.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: **3.5**
