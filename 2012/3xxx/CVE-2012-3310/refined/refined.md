- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper logging configurations in Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) cause passwords to be written to trace files, either in clear text or in an easily-derived obfuscated form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Clear text logging of passwords in multiple scenarios:
        - LDAP "Bind Password" when "all" TFIM log trace is enabled.
        - Client Basic Authentication password when using HTTP-Artifact SAML 2.0 Federation SSO.
        - End-user supplied password when issuing UsernameToken.
    - Obfuscated logging of keystore passwords that can be derived when "all" TFIM log trace is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Compromise of password confidentiality, specifically the passwords used by TFIM, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate users, access resources, or gain further access to the system
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through logging trace files of TFIM. The attack does not require network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs elevated privileges to enable logging.
    - The attacker needs elevated privileges to access the trace files.
    - The attacker needs specialized knowledge and techniques to exploit the vulnerability.
