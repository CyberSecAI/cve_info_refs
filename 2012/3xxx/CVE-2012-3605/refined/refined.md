The provided content includes security updates for iTunes 10.7, Safari 6, and iOS 6. All three mention CVE-2012-3605, which is related to WebKit.

**iTunes 10.7:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Multiple memory corruption issues in WebKit.
*  **Impact:** Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Root cause:** Memory corruption issues existed in WebKit.
*  **Attack vector:** Visiting a maliciously crafted website.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to host or control a website that can be visited by a user of iTunes 10.7.

**Safari 6:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Multiple memory corruption issues in WebKit.
*   **Impact:** Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Root cause:** Memory corruption issues existed in WebKit.
*  **Attack vector:** Visiting a maliciously crafted website.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to host or control a website that can be visited by a user of Safari 6.

**iOS 6:**
*   **Vulnerability:** Multiple memory corruption issues in WebKit.
*  **Impact:** Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
*  **Root cause:** Memory corruption issues existed in WebKit.
*   **Attack vector:** Visiting a maliciously crafted website.
*  **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to host or control a website that can be visited by a user of an iOS 6 device.

**Summary:**
Across all platforms, the root cause is memory corruption issues within WebKit. The impact is consistent: a maliciously crafted website can cause unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. The attack vector is always a website, meaning the attacker needs to control web content that a user of the vulnerable software would visit. The vulnerability is patched by improved memory handling in WebKit.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by detailing the vulnerable component (WebKit), the specific type of vulnerability (memory corruption), and the impact (unexpected termination or arbitrary code execution).
