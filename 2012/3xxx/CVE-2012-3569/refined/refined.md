Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-3569:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a format string vulnerability present in the VMware OVF Tool. This occurs when the tool parses specially crafted OVF files, specifically how it interprets format specifiers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The OVF Tool fails to properly sanitize format specifiers within an OVF file, which could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable OVF Tool.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the user running the OVF tool. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control over the system, install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious OVF File:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a malicious OVF file using a vulnerable version of the VMware OVF Tool.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers often use social engineering techniques to deliver malicious OVF files, such as via email attachments, instant messaging links, or compromised websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a malicious OVF file:** The attacker must be able to craft an OVF file with malicious format string specifiers.
*   **User interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to open the malicious OVF file with a vulnerable version of the OVF Tool.
*   **Social Engineering or Compromised Website:**  The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious file to the victim through methods like email, IM, or hosting it on a website.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability was discovered by Jeremy Brown of Microsoft and reported to VMware through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
*   The vulnerability affects VMware OVF Tool version 2.1 and earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in OVF Tool 3.0.1, as well as in updates to VMware Workstation (8.0.5) and VMware Player (4.0.5) which bundle the OVF tool.
*   This vulnerability is also present in other VMware products that use the vulnerable version of OVF tool, including Workstation and Player.
