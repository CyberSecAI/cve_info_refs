b. VMware Virtual Machine Remote Device Denial of Service
A device (e.g. CD-ROM, keyboard) that is available to a virtual machine while physically connected to a system that does not run the virtual machine is referred to as a remote device.
Traffic coming from remote virtual devices is incorrectly handled. This may allow an attacker who is capable of manipulating the traffic from a remote virtual device to crash the virtual machine.
Workaround - None identified
Mitigation - Users need administrative privileges on the virtual machine in order to attach remote devices. - Do not attach untrusted remote devices to a virtual machine.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ( [cve.mitre.org](http://www.cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the name CVE-2012-3289 to this issue.
