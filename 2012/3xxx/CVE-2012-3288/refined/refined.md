- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of input data when loading Checkpoint files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with the ability to load a specially crafted Checkpoint file can execute arbitrary code on the host.
- **Attack vectors:** Loading a malicious Checkpoint file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to load a specially crafted Checkpoint file. Mitigation suggests not importing virtual machines from untrusted sources.
