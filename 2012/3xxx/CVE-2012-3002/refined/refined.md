Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an authentication bypass in the web interface firmware of certain IP cameras. This occurs due to insufficient access control checks on specific URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the web interface authentication mechanism by accessing specific URLs without proper authorization.
*   **Password Leakage:** The administrator's password is exposed through client-side JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Administrative Access:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain complete control of the IP camera via the web interface. This includes the ability to execute any command available through the interface, which means the attacker can manipulate the camera's configuration and functions without credentials.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker with administrative access may be able to view camera feeds.
*  **Complete System Takeover:** An attacker can perform any function a normal user can, effectively taking over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited through network access to the camera's web interface.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers do not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the IP camera's web interface over a network.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Vendors/Products (From CERT):**
* Foscam (Affected)
* Wansview (Affected)
* EasySe (Unknown)
* Easyn (Unknown)
* Hiwire (Unknown)
* apexis (Unknown)
It is stated that other vendors that share the same base firmware image are also vulnerable.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Don Kennedy.
*  Foscam released firmware updates to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability is described as being easily exploitable.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   **Base Score:** 9.7 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:P)
*   **Temporal Score:** 7.9 (E:POC/RL:U/RC:UC)

This indicates a high severity vulnerability that is remotely exploitable, requiring no authentication, and can lead to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and partial availability.

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply firmware updates provided by the vendor.
*   Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the web interface, allowing only trusted users.
