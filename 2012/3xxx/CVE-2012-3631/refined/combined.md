* **Safari Downloads**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Opening maliciously crafted files on certain websites may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

This header is used by many websites to serve files that were uploaded to the site by a third-party, such as attachments in web-based e-mail applications. Any script in files served with this header value would run as if the file had been served inline, with full access to other resources on the origin server. This issue is addressed by downloading resources served with this header, rather than displaying them inline.
