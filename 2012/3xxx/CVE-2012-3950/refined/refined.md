Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-3950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) feature of Cisco IOS Software. Specifically, a flaw is present in how the IPS handles certain DNS packets when specific IPS configurations are present.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) issue that can be triggered remotely.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending legitimate DNS packets through a device with a specific vulnerable IPS configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a complete reload (crash/reboot) of the affected Cisco IOS device. This results in a denial of service, making the device unavailable until it reboots.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based; the attacker sends malicious packets over the network to a vulnerable device.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability (unauthenticated).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic (specifically crafted DNS packets) to the targeted device. This implies the attacker would need to have network connectivity to the device.
- The attacker does not require any privileged access or specific credentials.

**Vulnerable Configurations:**
- The device is vulnerable if:
    1. Any of the following IPS categories are enabled: `diag2`, `general_os`, `general_attack`, `general_service`, `tcp`, `udp`, `dns`, `advanced`, `basic`, or `past_releases`.
    2. The four IPS signatures `6054:0`, `6054:1`, `6062:0`, and `6062:1` are all *not compiled*.

**Mitigation:**
- Enabling any of the vulnerable signatures `6054:0`, `6054:1`, `6062:0`, or `6062:1` will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
- Alternatively, disabling DNS inspection for the affected Cisco IOS IPS can also mitigate the vulnerability by preventing inspection of DNS traffic.
- Upgrading to a fixed version of Cisco IOS software will remediate the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8 and a temporal score of 6.4
- The advisory includes specific instructions and CLI commands to identify vulnerable configurations and how to apply the workarounds.
- The document provides a detailed list of affected Cisco IOS Software releases and fixed releases, including links to the Cisco Software Checker tool.
- The advisory confirms that Cisco IOS XE and IOS XR Software are not vulnerable to this issue.
