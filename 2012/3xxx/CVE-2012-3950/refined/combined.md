Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsDevices configured with Cisco IOS IPS are affected by this vulnerability under certain Cisco IOS IPS configurations when running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS Software.      A device will have an affected configuration if both of the following two conditions are true:   1. Any of the following categories are enabled in the Cisco IOS IPS configuration:      + diag2 (in configurations)      + general\_os (in os)      + general\_attack (in attack)      + general\_service (in other\_services)      + tcp (in l2/l3/l4\_protocol/ip)      + udp (in l2/l3/l4\_protocol/ip)      + dns (network\_services)      + advanced (in ios\_ips)      + basic (in ios\_ips)      + past\_releases (in releases) To determine if any of the preceding categories are enabled, log in to the device and enter the command line interface (CLI) command **show ip ips configuration | begin IPS Category CLI Configuration**. If any of the above categories are in the output and have the **Enable** field value **True**, then the category is enabled. The following example shows a device with the category basic enabled on the device:  ```      Router#show ip ips configuration | begin IPS Category CLI ConfigurationIPS Category CLI Configuration:    Category all:        Retire: True        Enable: False    Category ios_ips basic:        Retire: False        Enable: True    Category other_services:        Retire: True        Enable: False      ```   2. If the four IPS signatures 6054:0, 6054:1, 6062:0, 6062:1 are all not compiled.      To determine if the four signatures are all not compiled log into the device and enter the CLI command **show ip ips signatures | include 6054|6062**. If the compiled status column (third column in the example, all of which have the **Nr** value), shows any value other than **Y** then the signature is not compiled. The following example shows a device with all four signatures not compiled on the device: ```   Router#show ip ips signatures | include 6054|6062  6062:1     N*  Nr    A      LOW     0     1    0    200   30  FA  N 100 S3  6062:0     N*  Nr    A      LOW     0     1    0    200   30  FA  N 100 S3  6054:1     N*  Nr    A      LOW     0     1    0    200   30  FA  N 100 S2  6054:0     N*  Nr    A      LOW     0     1    0    200   30  FA  N 100 S2   ``` To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are not affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco IPS 4200 Series Sensors   + Cisco IPS 4300 Series Sensors   + Cisco ASA Advanced Inspection and Prevention Security Services Module   + Cisco ASA IP Audit for Basic IPS Support   + Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Intrusion Detection System   + Cisco IOS Software Firewall Intrusion Detection SystemNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco IOS Software contains a denial of service vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.      An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending legitimate DNS packets through a device with an affected Cisco IOS IPS configuration. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.       This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCtw55976](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtw55976) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-3950.  Workarounds  * Either of the following two mitigations will prevent exploitation of the vulnerability against the device:       **Enable DNS Version Request (6054/0 and 6054/1) and DNS Authors Request (6062/0 and 6062/1) signatures on the device**   Enabling any of the 6054 or 6062 signatures will prevent exploitation. The following example shows all four signatures enabled: ```   Router#configure terminalEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.Router(config)#ip ips signature-definitionRouter(config-sigdef)#signature 6054 0Router(config-sigdef-sig)#statusRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#enabled trueRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#retired falseRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#signature 6054 1Router(config-sigdef-sig)#statusRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#enabled trueRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#retired falseRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#signature 6062 0Router(config-sigdef-sig)#statusRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#enabled trueRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#retired falseRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#signature 6062 1Router(config-sigdef-sig)#statusRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#enabled trueRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#retired falseRouter(config-sigdef-sig-status)#endDo you want to accept these changes? [confirm]   ``` **Disable DNS inspection for Cisco IOS IPS**   To configure a Cisco IOS IPS device not to inspect DNS traffic, attach an access list to the IPS name which denies DNS traffic. The following example shows an ACL attached to the IPS name, which instructs Cisco IOS IPS not to examine DNS packets: ```   Router#show running-config      !   ip ips name iosips list dont_inspect_dns   !   ip access-list extended dont_inspect_dns deny   udp any any eq domain deny   tcp any any eq domain    remark  permit ip any any   ``` Additional information about Tuning, Deploying and Updating Cisco IOS IPS Signature Sets For Multiple-Device Deployments is available at the following link <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6634/white_paper_c11_549300.html>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2012 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release, where possible.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
