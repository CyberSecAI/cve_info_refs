# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-78

## Reader Mode pages have chrome privileges

Announced
October 9, 2012
Reporter
Warren He
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 16

### Description

Security researcher **Warren He** reported that when a page is
transitioned into Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly sanitized. A successful
attack requires user enabling of reader mode for a malicious page, which could
then perform an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This has been fixed by
changing the Reader Mode page into an unprivileged page.

This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Confirmed locally. Clicking a link of <a href="javascript:alert(Components.stack);">link</a> shows we have chrome privileges in that page, and event handlers (for example, I tested onclick) don't get stripped from at least links.
This feature does not appear to have requested or gotten a security review. Adding a chrome-privileged page with web/user-derived content is about the most dangerous thing we do and should not have skipped that step.
about: urls should only be privileged as a last resort -- see the no end of troubles we've had with the feed page. It's not always the fault of the about: page either, it's just a convenient place to exploit any xpconnect wrapper problems we happen to have.
innerHTML is a screaming red flag of danger.
We should be using the common sanitizer we already have and not writing a new one. They're trouble and hard to get right (see again the feed page).Assignee: nobody → lucasr.at.mozillaBlocks: [750712](/show_bug.cgi?id=750712 "VERIFIED FIXED - Reader Mode: Implement about:reader")Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueKeywords: [sec-critical](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-critical&resolution=---)

[mid-aired with myself in the middle of a comment. Interesting]
...The only safe way is to use the same parser used by the browser itself. Look into nsIParserUtils, or ask the content folks what to do if that's not suitable (particularly hsivonen). Parsing by regexp is another red flag. There are zillions of ways to encode HTML to evade parsers, see all the XSS even on sites that are trying to be careful. The right sanitizer would have stripped out the event handlers.
I shouldn't have been able to add a javascript: link. Whitelist http/https and strip links that use any other scheme.
As long as the page is privileged there must be absolutely no embeds. Even if we trust youtube and vimeo to re-encode all videos and remove scripts, unless it's an https: URL we can't trust that the content is actually from those sites. Even if it is https: the content may not be safe in the presence of a MITM proxy that many people have to use to get access to the internet. It's one thing to trust your employer MITM not to mess with your sites (you can avoid the sensitive ones), it's another to have to trust it not to compromise your browser/machine.
Consider creating a document (sub frame?) with an explicit nsNullPricipal and then adding the content DOM to that.

Attached patch

[Move reader document to unprivileged iframe](attachment.cgi?id=648221&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=648221&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=778582&attachment=648221)

Here's one approach - this uses a chrome page with a null principal inside of an iframe as suggested in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=778582#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - reader mode chrome xss"). I don't know how to make an unprivileged chrome URL other than by specifying it in AboutRedirector.js, so I did that by creating an about:readercontent entry.
There are a couple of problems with this patch as-is:
1) Scrolling is a bit broken for some reason. When scrolling from the top or bottom of the page, scrolling abruptly stops after a small distance, requiring a second scroll.
2) The correct font isn't used. Since aboutReaderContent.html cannot refer to any chrome:// URLs, I haven't figured out a way to fix this yet.Assignee: lucasr.at.mozilla → bnicholson

Also, I just realized that we'll have to resize the iframe whenever the font size or margins change.

Weird that unprivileged about URIs can't access chrome:// URLs. Bunch of about URIs on Desktop seem to use it <https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/certerror/content/aboutCertError.xhtml>
Is there anything on Mobile that would cause this not to work?
also, an easier trick \*might\* be to make the main (parent) frame unprivileged, and create a 0px iframe that is privileged to do the coding part for you by postmessaging each other.
Alternatively, CSS tricks should make the unprivileged iframe completely 'seamless' <http://stackoverflow.com/a/5632609>

I noticed that too. I'm not sure what the difference is, but trying to include the same stylesheet in aboutReaderContent.html gives this error: "Content at about:readercontent may not load or link to chrome://browser/skin/aboutCertError.css".

One problem with this approach might be the reader toolbar, which is a div in the page containing buttons to perform certain actions (share, change font size, etc.). With the reader content being in its own frame, the reader toolbar can stay in the privileged parent page without any issues. If the unprivileged page is the parent frame, I think we'd have to put the toolbar in that same page, which means the content could access it.
> Alternatively, CSS tricks should make the unprivileged iframe completely
> 'seamless' <http://stackoverflow.com/a/5632609>
Yeah, I think that's essentially what I did (no border or padding on the frame). The problem is having to resize the frame when its contents change, but I don't think that part can be fixed with CSS.
Originally, I just made the iframe style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%" so that the frame took up the entire viewport. This made the frame scroll rather than its parent. But this had several undesirable side effects on mobile: scrolling was noticeably choppier, there was no "bounce" overscroll effect, and the scrollbar doesn't appear (since on mobile, the top-level document is the only frame with a scrollbar).

Are the buttons the only place where the privileges are needed? The about pages on Desktop have all the click handlers for about:certerror / about:blocked etc. in browser.js, so that those pages could run unprivileged.

Yeah, the buttons and the readability parsing itself are the only things that need chrome privileges. I did want to inject these things from browser.js, but the lack of chrome:// URL support was a problem since there was no obvious way to include the many chrome:// images we have in aboutReader.css.

Attached patch

[Move reader document to unprivileged iframe, v1.2](attachment.cgi?id=648247&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=648247&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=778582&attachment=648247)

According to <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.scrollHeight>, scrollHeight does not include margins. We had margins at the top and bottom of aboutReaderContent.html, so iframe height was being set to a value slightly smaller than its full height. This explains why I was seeing broken scrolling behavior: the first scroll just scrolled the iframe the remaining overflow amount, and the second scroll was what actually scrolled the page.
Here's a build with these changes: <http://dl.dropbox.com/u/35559547/fennec-readability-iframe.apk>
Now I think the only thing left is fixing the font.

Move reader document to unprivileged iframe, v1.2
This looks good to me from a high level. We should get Dan to look at the iframe, loading a non-privileged about: page.
Lucas can review for the reader functionality side too.

Automatically resizes the iframe whenever we receive a MozScrollAreaChanged or DOMSubtreeModified event. Apparently, MozScrollAreaChanged wasn't enough since it only fired when increasing the font size; decreasing the font size kept the page the same height (and the event didn't fire).

Makes it so about:reader doesn't show up in about:about. In general, we don't show about: sites on that page if they require a query string to work correctly.

We still need the frame itself to resize it in patch 3. If you prefer, we could have both \_frame and \_frameDocument.

I didn't ask, but I think we need this. Otherwise, links will open inside of the readability content frame, which we definitely don't want. If the link points to a standard web page, that would mean they'd be browsing inside of about:reader, which would be weird.

Ok, then do a "let frameDocument = this.\_frame.contentDocument" here and use it everywhere in the init() method.

Does this work? According to comments in the manifest parser, contentaccessible is only used on "content". This is bolstered by the fact that ManifestLocale() and ManifestSkin() in nsChromeRegistryChrome.cpp don't do anything with the contentaccessible param. Maybe you're inheriting the content setting from /browser/base/jar.mn, or does Fennec have it's own copy in /mobile ?
But then you're unlikely to have added it if it wasn't broken without it. Is something mysterious and broken in the chrome registry/parser?

Thanks - that shouldn't have made it into the patch. I think that was left over from when I tried various things to make the font import work.

I'm still uneasy about this direct manipulation of unprivileged content from a chrome context. I'd prefer something more indirect, like running scripts using EvalInSandbox or sending the data to the child frame using postMessage(). Our wrappers are supposed to save us, but if they fail this could be wide open.
On the other hand, at this point in reader there is no web content in the unprivileged frame, and if the readability scripts end before any content gets to run then we are probably OK. Need to talk to the wrapper gurus (mrbkap, bholley, jst).

Can you clarify the approach, the concern, and the potential alternatives?
In general, it's pretty safe to rely on Xray wrappers to do their job when accessing native properties (as long as you don't turn them off with .wrappedJSObject / XPCNativeWrapper.unwrap). You get a clean view of the DOM, though content is free to manipulate the DOM in confusing ways.
And as a general principle, defense-in-depth is a good thing. :-)

On mobile, we have a feature called Reader Mode that performs sanitization on the document to remove any content not relevant to the article being viewed; see [1] for a screenshot. The sanitization is performed using a custom JS script [2] that's run inside of a web worker. Currently, we simply take the innerHTML of the parsed result, and set the innerHTML to a div in about:reader to that result. about:reader is a privileged chrome page, so this introduces a gaping security hole by allowing JS from the web page to run in a privileged context.
The approach here creates an unprivileged iframe on about:reader to contain the parsed document. This is done by creating another about: page - about:readercontent - which is unprivileged (I don't know of another way to include an unprivileged chrome document inside of a privileged one). The iframe's document is manipulated directly from the parent document, e.g.:
+ this.\_frame = document.getElementById("frame");
+ this.\_contentElement = this.\_frame.contentDocument.getElementById("reader-content");
+ let bodyStyle = this.\_frame.contentDocument.body.style;
+ this.\_frame.contentDocument.addEventListener("click", this, false);
From [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=778582#c29 "RESOLVED FIXED - reader mode chrome xss"), I think Dan's concern is that accessing these properties/methods is potentially dangerous if the wrappers somehow fail since we are directly accessing and calling them from a privileged context.
As for alternatives, we could do something like postMessage() to the frame to avoid these direct manipulations, as Dan mentioned.

This is totally fine. Our story here is really good. Even if you turn off Xray vision (with .wrappedJSObject), the content code still runs with its own privileges. The principal of a function is computed from the compartment in which it is defined, so chrome can freely call into content JS.

Do you mean to say that you're loading untrusted content into a type=chrome iframe? Because that's...not good.

It's an HTML iframe (both the parent and child frames are HTML documents), so there's no type attribute set. Since the subdocument is from a chrome URL, it (and the untrusted content) would typically have chrome privileges, but by adding the page to aboutRedirector.js [1] with "privileged: false", these privileges are lost.

On a related note, I tried using a XUL iframe like this:
<iframe
xmlns="<http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul>"
type="content"
src="chrome://...">
</iframe>
But the subdocument still had chrome privileges. Any idea why?

Ah, interesting. I hadn't seen this hack before. I hope we have tests to make sure the pages really are unprivileged? That seems like just the sort of thing I'd break while cleaning up CAPS. ;-)

Because the principal of a page is determined by the document URI, and modulo hacks like the above, a chrome:// URI is converted into nsSystemPrincipal. The docshell type is used for different things.

AFAIK, we do not - I filed [bug 783566](/show_bug.cgi?id=783566 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Add test cases to verify about: privileges") to take care of this.

Here is a test case for the chrome xss using Dan's comment
STR
1. Visit
about:reader?url=<path to test case>
2. Scroll down and click on the link that says
"Click"
3. You should get an alert popup
Sorry for how hacky the testcase is. I'm unfamiliar with the exact format of reader mode articles.

I discussed with mfinkle and mgoodwin just now (and Gavin yesterday as well).
I think the right thing to do here is :
1. land this fix asap - it's sec-critical and was apparently found via code inspection and isn't a hard issue to find. there's a manual test case which is blocked by the fix in the bug according to bnicholson.
2. uplift the fix to Aurora - same rationale as #1
3. schedule a proper sec review for this feature - mgoodwin is going to file a bug for this - and we should make sure dveditz is involved.
4. try to harden the feature more fully in the near future, this could involve using iframe sandbox or perhaps other approaches, but discussing and having a considered approach
5. we should really do the testing in [bug 783566](/show_bug.cgi?id=783566 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Add test cases to verify about: privileges") to make sure things are the way we think they are with the approach we're using overall (adding privileged:false in aboutRedirector.js)
This is assuming that Dan's constraints in [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=778582#c29 "RESOLVED FIXED - reader mode chrome xss") : "On the other hand, at this point in reader there is no web content in the unprivileged frame, and if the readability scripts end before any content gets to run then we are probably OK." are true. I believe the first part is at least (links open outside the frame), can someone confirm the second part is also ?
FWIW, I'm not so worried about holes in our wrapper implementation since we rely on those all over and that would be a bigger issue than this bug.

I confirm that we don't inject any content until the readability script has completely finished.
But I think it is possible for web content to be run in the unprivileged frame. We set 'base target="\_parent"' in the content frame HTML, so any scripts that run on the content page could override this. Won't the wrappers save us here, though?

Apparently, the R3 failures are caused by patch 2: <https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=292a4aa6537b>
The only parts of the patch not specific to about:reader are the font declarations. It's not obvious why they would be causing any failures, but one possibility suggested by mbrubeck is that they are affecting the load timings of the page.
I pushed these patches to try with the font declarations removed from content.css to verify that they are, in fact, the cause of the failure: <https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=11806d2e2211>.

Attached patch

[Turn about:reader into an unprivileged page](attachment.cgi?id=655239&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=655239&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=778582&attachment=655239)

The patches that landed in m-c to fix this issue caused unintended side-effects: scrolling inside an iframe is not as smooth as before and the new code caused a few regressions (image positioning, unwanted margins, scrolling bugs, etc).
I'd like to propose a different approach to fix this bug which is both simpler and less intrusive. It involves simply turning about:reader into an unprivileged page and handling interaction with the page in browser.js. For instance, this is the same approach used for about:certerror page.
The only major issue I found is a bug that prevents us from using history.pushState() on the page directly from chrome. The patch has a workaround. Let me know if you know of a better way to do it.

Is it considered "fixed" even if aurora (currently shipping reader mode) doesn't have this fix yet?

The patch seems to be doing the "right stuff" to protect chrome code from bad interactions with content code. I see event.isTrusted checks for example.
I would like to know if the workaround used from [bug 682296](/show_bug.cgi?id=682296 "NEW - history API throws NS_UNEXPECTED-ERROR when used from addons, scratchpad and Web console") is considered safe though.

Turn about:reader into an unprivileged page
As discussed on IRC, one issue with this patch is the page's ability to manipulate the reader toolbar, so we may want to use Gecko's sanitization utilities before adding the content to the page. But this at least fixes the main issue - the page getting chrome privileges - while also avoiding the regressions from the iframe-based patch.

that looks ok to me, it's sticking a static string that can't be influenced by content in the history.

right, i read through this and the crucial bit looks like :
reader: {
uri: "chrome://browser/content/aboutReader.html",
- privileged: true
+ privileged: false,
+ hide: true
which means no parts of Reader mode have chrome privs at all. This sounds like a solid approach. However, even if about:reader doesn't have chrome privs, can it still call into other chrome: things via URL injection etc ? i would hope not, but this is something we should look at as [bug 783566](/show_bug.cgi?id=783566 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Add test cases to verify about: privileges") says.
as i said in the comments for 785922 you might want to look into iframe sandbox
if you want to block running scripts, plugins, etc. I did see that one reason you wanted to avoid using an iframe is due to regressions though, so those might need addressing first :/
I noticed the issue described by [comment 64](/show_bug.cgi?id=778582#c64 "RESOLVED FIXED - reader mode chrome xss") while reviewing the patch, I suppose that a page could XSS itself (or hosted content could get your cookie on the hosting site)? but also see the concerns above about calling into other chrome: URL's. This is less than ideal but sanitization is difficult to get right as has been discussed.
Also I will state again that this feature really needs a proper secreview and most likely, some security testing. mgoodwin has filed [bug 785077](/show_bug.cgi?id=785077 "RESOLVED FIXED - SecReview: Reader Mode") for this.

Are the original patches still desired for Beta 16, given the regressions we've found? Or can we wait for the final solution?

From my perspective, we should fix the chrome XSS on beta. I'm OK with either patch although I think Lucas' no chrome privilege patch is a nice way of reducing attack surface.
Then the Security Assurance team can get a secreview scheduled, we can discuss approaches towards the overall solution, and maybe they can do some security testing as well of this.

Agreed. Tuesday, Lucas can backout the previous iframe-based patch from nightly and aurora, and land the new approach. Once things look OK, we can also uplift to beta.
Sound OK?

This sounds like a good approach.

Yep, but let's just get the final solution into beta 2 and skip resolving this for beta 1. That'll give us plenty of time to converge.

Attached patch

[Add contentaccessible=yes flag](attachment.cgi?id=656411&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=656411&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=778582&attachment=656411)

Merge conflict confused me (feedback page landed) and I unintentionally removed the contentaccessible=yes flag from chrome's jar.nm. Reader is currently broken in nightly because of that. This patch fixes it.

Turn about:reader into an unprivileged page
[Approval Request Comment]
User impact if declined: We're posting untrusted content on a privileged chrome page. We can't do that.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Landed in m-c, no regressions found.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Relatively low as this patch is just moving calling points to allow about:reader to become an unprivileged page.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None

Add contentaccessible=yes flag
[Approval Request Comment]
User impact if declined: This patch fixes reader mode in Nightly. This should be folded with the main patch.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Landed in m-c, no regressions found.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Low, just an obvious fix on the main patch.

An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

dropdown menu can be used for URL spoofing, other evil
Firefox 10.0.1 : Navigation away from a page with
multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*

\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*

\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.
