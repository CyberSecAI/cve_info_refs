Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2012-3987:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that when a page is transitioned into Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page had chrome privileges. This allowed the content of the page, which might have come from an untrusted source, to operate with elevated permissions. Furthermore, the content was not properly sanitized, increasing the risk of malicious code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper privilege assignment: Reader Mode pages were incorrectly granted chrome privileges.
- Lack of input sanitization: Content loaded in Reader Mode was not sufficiently sanitized, allowing for potential XSS attacks.
- Use of `innerHTML`: Using `innerHTML` to insert content without proper sanitization was a major source of risk.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS): An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the Reader Mode page, gaining access to the privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This could include access to sensitive information or the ability to perform actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious web page: An attacker would host a web page designed to trigger the vulnerability when the user enables Reader Mode.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a web page that is able to be parsed by reader mode and include malicious javascript that exploits the lack of sanitization and the chrome privileges.
- The user must use Firefox for Android.
- The user must enable reader mode for the malicious page.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was reported by security researcher Warren He.
- The vulnerability was fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an unprivileged page.
- The fix was included in Firefox 16.
