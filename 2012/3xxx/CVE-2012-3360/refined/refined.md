Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3360:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content directly references CVE-2012-3360 and describes it as a directory traversal vulnerability in OpenStack Nova.
   - The descriptions and references align with the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in `virt/disk/api.py` within OpenStack Nova. Specifically, the code does not adequately sanitize or validate file paths provided by users when injecting files into disk images.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to use `..` (dot dot) sequences in file paths to escape the intended directory and write to arbitrary locations.
   - **Insecure File Injection:** The vulnerability exists in how Nova handles file injection into disk images, allowing users to specify paths outside the intended image mount directory.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary File Write:** A remote authenticated user can write files to arbitrary locations on the host's file system. This can lead to:
   - **Full Compromise:** The ability to write to arbitrary locations can allow an attacker to overwrite crucial system files or inject malicious code, leading to full control of the compute node.
   - **Denial of Service:** By corrupting system files, an attacker can cause system instability or denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Remote Access:** The attack can be launched remotely.
   - **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the OpenStack API.
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to request file injection while creating or modifying instances.
    - No specific position in the network is mentioned besides being able to reach the OpenStack API.

**Additional Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerability is present in OpenStack Nova versions Folsom (2012.2) and Essex (2012.1), when used over libvirt-based hypervisors.
   - The `path` attribute of a file element is used to specify the location of file injection.
    -The fix involves adding a function  `_join_and_check_path_within_fs` that checks if the final path is still within the mounted filesystem.
    - The vulnerable code is located in  `nova/virt/disk/api.py`, in functions `inject_files()` and `_inject_file_into_fs()`.
    - This vulnerability is part of a set of vulnerabilities, which were fixed in a single patch.

**Summary of Information:**

The provided content describes CVE-2012-3360 as a critical directory traversal vulnerability in OpenStack Nova. By exploiting this flaw, a remote authenticated user can inject files into arbitrary locations on the compute node's file system, potentially gaining full control of the system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the file injection process when using libvirt hypervisors and affects Essex and later setups.
