{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Puppet master server incorrectly handles DELETE requests, allowing authenticated clients to delete arbitrary files if the 'Delete' method is enabled in the auth.conf file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of DELETE requests",
      "Insufficient input validation of node names in the report store processor, leading to directory traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file deletion on the Puppet master server, potentially causing a denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted DELETE requests from authenticated Puppet clients",
        "Directory traversal via manipulated node names"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "A valid client certificate to authenticate with the Puppet master.",
        "The 'Delete' method must be enabled in the Puppet master's auth.conf file (non-default configuration)"
    ],
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability does not exist by default as the 'Delete' method is disabled in auth.conf by default. The fix includes input validation for node names to prevent directory traversal when storing reports, and is implemented by rejecting node names that contain directory traversal characters."
