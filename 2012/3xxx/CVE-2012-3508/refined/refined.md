Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-3508:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities in Roundcube webmail.

**Root Cause:**

*   **Issue 2a:** Stored XSS in the email body. The `washtml.php` file was not properly sanitizing `href` attributes that contained "javascript:" URLs in HTML emails.
*   **Issue 2b:** Self-XSS in the email body (specifically in the signature). This was due to an issue with how the rcube\_webmail() function in `program/js/app.js` handled user input, likely related to signature processing.

**Weaknesses:**

*   Insufficient sanitization of user-controlled data within the `href` attributes of HTML tags, specifically the failure to strip out "javascript:" URLs.
*   Inadequate input validation and output encoding in the rcube\_webmail() function, leading to the ability to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Issue 2a (Stored XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into an email body. This script would be executed when a user views the email, potentially leading to:
    *   Account hijacking through session stealing.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.
*   **Issue 2b (Self-XSS):** Although labeled as "Self-XSS," this can still be exploited via social engineering. An attacker can trick a user into pasting malicious code into their signature (or any other field processed by `rcube_webmail()`), leading to the same consequences as above, but typically within the user's own context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Issue 2a (Stored XSS):** Sending a specially crafted email to the target that contains malicious JavaScript in the HTML body.
*   **Issue 2b (Self-XSS):** Tricking a user into pasting or inputting malicious JavaScript into the email body, signature or related field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Issue 2a (Stored XSS):** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a target user using the vulnerable Roundcube instance. This could be an attacker with an email account on the same server or an external attacker able to send emails.
*   **Issue 2b (Self-XSS):** The attacker requires some level of interaction with the victim, social engineering or a way to get the target user to copy and paste malicious code into a vulnerable field.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for Issue 2a involved modifying the `washtml.php` file to explicitly block `href` attributes starting with "javascript:". The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that `href` attributes containing javascript are removed.
*   The fix for Issue 2b likely involved changes to the `rcube_webmail()` function in `program/js/app.js` to properly handle or sanitize user-provided input.
*   The vulnerabilities were fixed in Roundcube version 0.8.1.
