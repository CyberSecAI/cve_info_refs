{
  "cveId": "CVE-2012-3403",
  "vulnerability": {
    "summary": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the KiSS CEL file format plugin of the GIMP image manipulation program.",
    "details": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw, leading to an invalid free, was found in the way the KiSS CEL file format plug-in of GIMP performed loading of certain palette files. This could allow a remote attacker to provide a specially crafted KiSS palette file that, when opened in GIMP, could cause the CEL plugin to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP executable.",
    "affectedComponents": [
      "GIMP KiSS CEL file format plug-in"
    ],
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation when loading KiSS palette files, specifically when handling the file header and data, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow due to an integer overflow during size calculation.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Integer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the GIMP executable.",
    "attackVector": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by providing a specially-crafted KiSS palette file to a user of GIMP.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious KiSS palette file and convince a GIMP user to open the file.",
    "affectedVersions": [
      "All GIMP versions prior to the patch"
    ],
    "remediation": "Apply the patch provided by the vendor to correct the input validation flaws."
