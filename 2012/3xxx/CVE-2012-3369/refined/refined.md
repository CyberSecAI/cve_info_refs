{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `CallerIdentityLoginModule` in JBoss retains the password from the previous call if a null password is provided, and then uses that password for the next authentication attempt with the given username.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of null passwords leading to credential reuse"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could hijack the credentials of a previously authenticated user if they can force a null password to be used in subsequent authentication attempts, and know the username",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack",
      "Exploiting an application which uses the vulnerable `CallerIdentityLoginModule` and permits authentication with null passwords"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to trigger authentication attempts with a null password. Also, the attacker must know the username of a previously authenticated user."
