This error was interpreted wrongly because the negative return value was assigned to a variable of unsigned type and being checked for <= 0.

```
Package: dtach
Version: 0.8-2
Severity: important

If the terminal window is closed without detaching the session, a string of random characters seems to be sent to the application in the session.  This can cause some problems - for example the text can be a message in irssi, or can affect settings in rtorrent.

Hi Stefan

It's not reported upsteam AFAIK. I'm just fixing RC and security bugs
for the upcoming release of wheezy.

Cheers

Luk

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.7) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].
