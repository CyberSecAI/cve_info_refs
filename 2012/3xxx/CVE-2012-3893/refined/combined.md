Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

### Resolved Caveats—Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S6

* CSCtg57599

Symptom: Lots of SNMP CPUHOG messages are seen and there is a crash due to a watchdog timeout:

%SYS-3-CPUHOG: Task is running for (126004)msecs, more than (2000)msecs (252/37),process =SNMP ENGINE

%SYS-2-WATCHDOG: Process aborted on watchdog timeout, process = SNMP ENGINE

Conditions: Device is configured with SNMP and is polled for Dot3Stats.

Workaround 1: Use the following command: no snmp-server sparse-tables.

Workaround 2: Block the objects in dot3 mib that contains this table from being polled:

snmp-server view cutdown iso included

snmp-server view cutdown 1.3.6.1.2.1.10.7 excluded

Then to apply the view, use:

no snmp-server community your\_string\_here RO

no snmp-server community your\_string\_here RW

and then put it back so it looks like:

snmp-server community your\_string\_here view cutdown RO

snmp-server community your\_string\_here view cutdown RW

Further Problem Description: Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to trigger a high CPU on the device via walking specific SNMP objects.

The vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable in the code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing SNMP walks against objects on the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU on the affected devices.

This vulnerability is not consistently exploitable.

PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 6.3/5.2:  <https://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvssCalculator.do?dispatch=1&version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C>

CVE ID CVE-2012-5030 has been assigned to document this issue.

Additional information on Cisco’s security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL:  <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html>

* CSCtq23960

Symptoms: A Cisco ISRG2 3900 series platform using PPC architecture crashes and generates empty crashinfo files:

show flash: all

-#- --length-- -----date/time------ path <<snip>> 2 0 Mar 13 2011 09:40:36 crashinfo\_<date> 3 0 Mar 13 2011 12:35:56 crashinfo\_<date> 4 0 Mar 17 2011 16:14:04 crashinfo\_<date> 5 0 Mar 21 2011 05:50:58 crashinfo\_<date>

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a Cisco ISRG2 3900 series platform using PPC architecture.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtu42387

Symptoms: Gigabit and 10 Gigabit Fiber link reporting threshold violation alarm in Cisco ME3600, Cisco ME3800, and Cisco 7600 devices. The “%SFF8472-3-THRESHOLD\_VIOLATION: Gi0/11: Rx power high alarm” error message is seen on ports.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on Cisco ME3600, Cisco ME3800, and Cisco 7600 devices. The messages are seen with the interface shut or no shut.

SFF8472-3-THRESHOLD\_VIOLATION Gi5/1: Rx power low alarm; Operating value: -28.5 dBm, Threshold value: -24.0 dBm

Workaround: Fixing the fiber signal issue or disconnecting the fiber from the transceiver has been known to stop the messages.

* CSCtv21900

Symptoms: Intermittent one-way audio occurs from an MGCP gateway to a Cisco IP phone.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Encrypted call with SRTP - MGCP Controlled Gateway

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M or later releases

Phone logs show the following message:

6622: DBG 23:29:50.256330 DSP: RTP RX: srtp\_unprotect() again 6623: DBG 23:29:50.257139 DSP: RTP RX: srtp\_unprotect() failed with error code 7 6624: DBG 23:29:50.276390 DSP: RTP RX: srtp\_unprotect() failed with auth func 3

The “Rcvr Lost Packet” counter on the Cisco IP phone begins to increment as soon as the call connects.

Workaround 1: Downgrade the software to Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)T or earlier releases.

Workaround 2: Perform a hold/resume on the one-way audio call. This mitigates the problem.

* CSCty16106

Symptom: IKE/GDOI bypass policy entries (four entries) are downloaded to PAL dataplane SADB as part of the initial policy download. But, as IKE/GDOI traffic is never routed to tunnel interfaces, the entries are not required for tunnel protection cases.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with IKE/GDOI bypass policy entries.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz97771

Symptom: During regular operations, a Cisco router running Cisco IOS release 12.4(24)T and possibly other releases experiences a crash. The crash info will report the following:

%SYS-2-FREEFREE: Attempted to free unassigned memory at 4A001C2C, alloc 4180794C, dealloc 417616B0,

%SYS-6-BLKINFO: Attempt to free a block that is in use blk 4A001BFC, words 134, alloc 4180794C, Free, dealloc 417616B0, rfcnt 0,

Conditions: This symptom is not observed under any specific conditions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc60868

Symptom: A router randomly crashes either due to memory corruption at bgp\_timer\_wheel or memory chunks near bgp\_timer\_wheel (For example, BFD event chunks if BFD is configured or AtoM Manager chunks if LDP is configured). A crash occurs right after an LDP neighbor is up in the L2VPN setup.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when vpls bgp signaling is unconfigured and then reconfigured. Both L2VPN and BGP are unconfigured and reconfigured after all L2VPN and BGP data structures are fully deleted (about 3 minutes for 5 BGP VPLS prefixes). For the repro on file, OSPF (for IGP) is also unconfigured and reconfigured. Both LDP and BGP signaling are affected by this caveat.

Workaround: Avoid unconfiguring and reconfiguring BGP L2VPN.

* CSCud25043

Symptoms: A WebVPN-enabled gateway crashes on Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M5 due to SSLVPN\_PROCESS.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M5

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) SSL VPN (WebVPN enabled)

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud55435

Symptom: Optimization of AAA and RADIUS function calls.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when AAA APIs are optimized based on X-ray reports.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud62864

Symptom: When the Mid-call Re-INVITE consumption feature is active, CUBE consumes Re-INVITE which should change the media state from “sendonly” to “sendrcv”. This results in a one way or no way audio on the call.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the CUBE Mid-call Re-INVITE consumption feature is enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud86991

Symptom: On ASR1K, the IOSd process may crash with “crypto dynamic-map” configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed When “crypto dynamic-map...” configuration is entered from CLI.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue06450

Symptom: If NTP is not configured on a Cisco ASR 1000 Series router, then PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) services such as auto enrollment and certificate rollover may not function correctly due to an invalid clock.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if NTP is not configured, or if NTP is not synchronized to the NTP server.

Workaround: Enable NTP on the router.

* CSCue23898

Symptom: A Cisco router running Cisco IOS Release 15.3(1)T may crash with a bus error immediately after issuing the  **write memory** command.

Example: 14:44:33 CST Thu Feb 14 2013: TLB (load or instruction fetch) exception, CPU signal 10, PC = 0x228B2C70

Conditions: This symptom occurs while updating the router’s running configuration with the  **write memory** command.

It is caused by this CLI command “ccm-manager redundant-host A.B.C.D A.B.C.D”. For example, “ccm-manager redundant-host 172.21.200.15 172.21.200.13”.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug37304

Symptom: The problem was experienced the first time on a UC560 that was upgraded to Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M5.

At the end of the investigation, it was determined that this is neither specific to the platform nor does it apply to Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M5.

This problem is platform independent and all releases leading to the most current release on Cisco.com in Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M (most recent release on Cisco.com at the time writing this explanation is Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M7) are affected by this issue.

Conditions: Crash is seen specifically when FXS ports are in STCAPP controlled mode.

Workaround: Use the standalone FXS Port, rather than STCAPP controlled. Configure the FXS port as a standalone FXS port, if possible.

* CSCug47401

Symptom: An RP crash is seen with 128K PWLAN sessions.

Conditions: This symptom is observed after trying to authenticate simple IP sessions with CoA

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh05259

Symptom: Prompt is provided for configure replace command when file prompt quiet is configured.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when “file prompt quiet” has been configured.

Workaround: Use “force” along with the configure replace command.

* CSCuh36124

Symptom: Service Routing/SAF in Cisco IOS Release 15.2.X.X is experiencing HIGH CPU during a failover condition where the active SAF forwarder looses connection to the network causing the clients to switch to the secondary forwarder. This issue occurs if the forwarder, that becomes active, still has an active neighbor that it needs to send updated registration data to (so more than two forwarders are required to observe this defect). Due to the high CPU condition during this failover, clients can experience longer registration times increasing the outage window.

Conditions: It has been validated in the lab, that the condition only occurs when more than two forwarders are involved and all the forwarders are peered to each other via direct configured peers or network based EIGRP peers. The HIGH CPU is caused directly by the connection that exists between SAF forwarders to exchange data across the network, and not due to the client towards SAF forwarder data exchange.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh56385

Symptom: Very slow propagation of data across a network of SAF forwarders after a fail over condition is observed. More than two SAF forwarders are required to observe this defect.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when there are more than two SAF forwarders in the network. After a fail over condition and the clients initiate advertising patterns into the standby forwarder, the propagation of these advertisements via update messages to the SAF peers can experience a 5 second inter-service advertisement delay.

Workaround: There is no workaround. Once the forwarder that suffered the fail over condition returns and establishes its neighbor relationships with its peers, the forwarders will update quickly.

* CSCuh68961

Symptom: In a DO-DO scenario, the CUBE is not able to send re-invite on other leg if the CUBE receives re-invite immediately followed by ACK.

Conditions: SIP (PSTN) -- CUBE -- SIP -- CUCM -- IP phone transfers to another IP phone Message Sequence in CUBE CUCM --> reINVITE --> CUBE --> reINVITE --> Provider <-- 200OK 200OK <-- ACK --> reINVITE --> --> ACK

reINVITE from CUCM is not forwarded to the provider

Workaround: There is no specific workaround. This issue is only seen from the Cisco IOS release 15.1(4)M and newer.

* CSCuh72000

Symptom: The TOS of one kind of PIM signaling packet is set to 6. When the packet is encapsulated into MPLS, the TOS value is copied to the EXP value. The packet will then be encapsulated into GRE/IP again, but the EXP value is not copied. PI just leaves the TOS in the IP/GRE header 0.

Conditions: This symptom does not occur under specific conditions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh87195

Symptom: A crash is seen on a Cisco router.

Conditions: The device crashes with gw-accounting and call-history configured. The exact conditions are still being investigated.

Workaround: Perform the following workaround:

 1. Completely remove gw-accounting

 2. Disable call-history using the following commands:

gw-accounting file

no acct-template callhistory-detail

* CSCui04860

Symptom: HA sync is not happening from active to standby.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when HA Sync-up is not happening for PKI Server on Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2.25)M0.1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCui29745

Symptom: Member links under MLPPP go down as the LCP negotiation of those PPP links fails.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after the router reloads and the traffic is flowing through the multilink.

Workaround: Reload SPA/LC on the other end of the link.

* CSCui51363

Symptom: The multilink does not pass traffic even though it is in an up/up state.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the auto DNR status is set and the sip400 ucode crashes.

Workaround: Perform a shut/no shut in the multilink.

* CSCui54359

Symptom: Switchover to T.38 fax-relay does not occur when configured for SG3 fax calls. Calls switchover to fax passthrough.

Conditions: This is observed when fax machines support the SuperG3 standard on both end and the voice gateways are configured to use H323 and T38 v3 fax relay.

example: dial-peer voice 1 voip

destination-pattern <did>

session target ipv4:<ip\_address>

fax protocol t38 version 3

or

voice service voip

fax protocol t38 version 3

Workaround: Use SIP as the VoIP protocol.

Add “session protocol sipv2” to the voip dial-peer.

If CUCM is involved, configure a SIP trunk for call handling from/to the voice gateway.

* CSCui59004

Symptom: IOSd crashes while removing NTP server from the configuration.

Conditions: This may occur rarely, when removing “ntp server <hosname>” from configuration. ntp servers configured with ip addresses will not cause the same.

Workaround: Timing the “no ntp” configuration such that it does not overlap with the 60 second DNS resolution timer.

* CSCui59927

Symptom: A memory leak is observed on a Cisco device due to IPSec which causes free memory to deplete to an extent where the device becomes unreachable.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when IPSec scaling is high.

Workaround: Reduce scaling of IPSec sessions.

* CSCui64807

Symptom: An active RP crashes during FIB sync because of memory overrun when the standby sup becomes unavailable.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when redundant RPs are configured in SSO mode and the standby RP becomes unavailable (for instance because of crash or physical removal). The issue occurs only on Cisco 7600 RSP 720, Cisco 7600 Series Supervisor Engine 720, and Cisco 7600 platforms where the tableid “ISSU FOF LC” support is enabled. As of 03/17/2014, the tableid “ISSI FOF LC” feature is only supported on SY releases. This issue does not impact Cisco ASR 1000 Series platforms.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCui85371

Symptom: Ikev2 session is NOT coming UP.

Conditions: This defect can be seen on an IKEv2 initiator only. The IKEv2 authentication mechanism is certificate based and a certificate map is configured under IKEv2 profile.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj14595

Symptom: A Cisco 3945 voice gateway running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M3 or Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M4 may have a processor pool memory leak in the CCSIP\_TCP\_SOCKET process.

Conditions: This symptom is seen on slow TCP connections, where the response is slow and frequent transmission errors are observed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj17818

Symptom: PPPoE is configured on radio interfaces. When a shut and no shut are issued on remote interface Router2, nine packets get stuck in the Router1 input queue.

Conditions: This problem is seen in Router1 when shut is issued on the Router2 interface to disconnect the PPPoE session between Router1 and Router2. In this case the Radio Emulator sends the PADQ packets to Router1 which gets stuck in input queue.

Workaround: Reloading the box to clear the input queue.

* CSCuj19201

Symptom: Re-registration time is recalculated on GM nodes upon receiving a TBAR rekey, based on the remaining TEK lifetime at the time of the TBAR rekey.

This effectively causes a much-shorter re-registration window compared to the one obtained at the GM registration, even if the original TEK lifetime was configured with a long value.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when TBAR is configured and long TEK lifetime used (more than 7200 seconds).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj30572

Symptom: With EIGRP and PFR configured, a Cisco router crashes after giving following EIGRP messages:

000111: Sep 17 09:08:33.331: %DUAL-5-NBRCHANGE: EIGRP-IPv4 1: Neighbor 10.50.2.1 (Tunnel502) is down: Peer Termination received 000112: Sep 17 09:08:33.347: %DUAL-3-INTERNAL: EIGRP-IPv4 1: Internal Error -Traceback= 319D4CB4z 319EC5E4z 319EC7C8z 319E4950z 319EA760z 31A25008z 32C23084z 32C23068z

Conditions: This symptom occurs when PFR, OER, and EIGRP are configured.

Say RouterUnderTest has two EIGRP Peers HUB1 and HUB2. (Given metrics are only for illustration)

When EIGRP has a Prefix with 3 different Paths installed in following order

DRDB1 NH - HUB1, Metric 36571392 / 0 (Installed by PFR)

DRDB2 NH - HUB2, Metric 58322432 / 409600 ( x Hops away learnt from RouterX)

DRDB3 NH - HUB1, Metric 538004992/500409600 (y Hops away learnt from Router Y)

With these initial conditions, if Neighbor ship with Router Y goes down, Both PFR and EIGRP try to delete DRDB3 Which results in inconsistent data structures with Memory corruption. Any further access to Memory will result in Crash.

Workaround: No possible work arounds seen. Using other Load sharing methods instead of PFR looks only possible work around.

More Info: Usually, the crash is seen during execution of EIGRP Route lookup function similar to below.

0x33841E10:eigrp\_pfr\_get\_drdb(0x33841ddc)+0x34 0x33842014:eigrp\_pfr\_route\_lookup(0x33841e88)+0x18c

* CSCuj62593

Symptom: Gateway crashes with MALLOCFAIL during ASR/TTS load.

Conditions: During longevity load for five days, crash is seen almost 61 hours into the load with Cisco IOS Release 15.3(3)M1 and almost 12 hours into load with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M5, due to the non-optimal usage of memory.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj72215

Symptom:

A vulnerability in handling of RTCP traffic of Cisco CUBE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause traffic destined to an affected device as well as traffic that needs to be processed-switched to fail.

The vulnerability is due to exhaustion of interface input queue by the RTCP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending RTCP packet in a specific sequence. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic destined to an affected device as well as traffic that needs to be processed- switched to fail.

Conditions:

RTCP packets have been found to be associated with SIP but any voice protocol may be involved.

The default input queue size is 75 on ISR routers. When the input queue fills up, the size (76) will exceed the max. This may look like an input queue wedge on the surface but for this bug, the packets should be drained once the call is torn down and the socket is removed. The RTCP packets should only be punted to the CPU for processing (and thus hit the input queue) when the RTP session isn’t yet established and we don’t have a socket. Once this establishment is done, RTCP traffic should be processed in the fast-path.

Workaround: To alleviate the problems caused by filling up the input queue, the size can be increased with the following command at the interface level, hold-queue <size> in.

To stop the issue altogether, RTCP would be need to be disabled by the voice endpoints.

PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 5/4.1:  <https://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvssCalculator.do?dispatch=1&version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C>

CVE ID CVE-2014-3268 has been assigned to document this issue.

Additional details about the vulnerability described here can be found at: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2014-3268

Additional information on Cisco’s security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL:  <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html>

* CSCuj82897

Symptom: The “control-word” length is not set properly for small HDLC packets running over HDLC AToM VC with SIP-200. For example: SPA-8XCHT1/E1.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when HDLC AToM VC with SIP-200 is deployed, for example, SPA-8XCHT1/E1, will result in a packet length mismatch issue or dropping by the remote PE router when HDLCoverMPLS runs over the Ethernet link adding an additional padding which cannot be classified at all.

Workaround: Use SIP-400.

* CSCuj85382

Symptom: ME3400 reload.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

 1. “ethernet cfm traceroute cache” configured.

 2. A Local only ethernet traceroute performed.

Workaround: Disable CFM traceroute cache by removing “ethernet cfm traceroute cache” configuration.

* CSCuj87667

Symptom: When value “xxx” of MPLS exp bits was copied to outer IP/GRE header TOS, the new TOS value should be “xxx00000” but now it is “00000xxx”, so that the QoS information was broken.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in MPLS over GRE case.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj94571

Symptom: To run the BERT test, remove “keepalive” from the interface. After completing the BERT test, adding “keepalive” causes the standby RSP to reset.

Conditions: This symptom is consistent and affects Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)S1.

Workaround: After the completion of the BERT test, remove the BERT test with “no bert pattern qrss interval <interval>” and then add “keepalive”. This will avoid standby RSP reset.

* CSCul27924

Symptom: Customer experienced crash on ASR-1001 during normal operation.

Conditions: This symptom is not observed under any specific condition.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCul49375

Symptom: The Cisco ASR 1000 router displays the following messages in the logs: %IDMGR-3-INVALID\_ID: bad id in id\_get (Out of IDs!) (id: 0x0) -Traceback= 1#cb40dca901558e45a65b881a8695af4f :400000+8653B3 :400000+893696 :400000+DF330C :400000+DED89B :400000+DF8643 :400000+1F57F36 :400000+1F4BBFB :400000+1F33BA7 :400000+1F336C1 :400000+1F34FF9 :400000+1F27763 :400000+1F29B16 :400000+2546FF3 :400000+2546EDD :400000+1F2930B

No new PPPoE sessions can be established anymore.

Conditions: The conditions to this symptom are unknown.

Workaround: Reload the device.

* CSCul54254

Symptom: Invalid LSAs are not flushed by the router which has their Advertising Router ID. Specifically, Router LSAs which do not have LSID of 0 will not be flushed if the router does not re-originate them, and any LSA with a type that the router does not recognize.

Lingering LSAs could lead to incorrect routing in some very obscure instances. For example, stale Router LSA fragments from two neighboring routers would need to remain in the network. There would not be a routing problem if only one router’s stale Router LSA fragment was allowed to linger.

Conditions: There are several possible scenarios that could lead to this symptom. One example is that a router is configured with many interfaces attached to an OSPFv3 instance such that it originates more than one Router LSA fragment. Then the router is reloaded before the configuration is saved, and after the reload it does not reoriginate some of the Router LSA fragments.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCul75876

Symptom: A router may crash in an OSPF process during reconfiguration.

Conditions: This symptom occurs under the following conditions:

 1. Configure the router with “ipfrr” in area 0.

 2. Connect router to area 0 through two links. For some route one interface is the primary path, and the second is the repair path.

 3. Configure router as ABR, that is, have a non-zero area with a neighbor. Do not configure “ipfrr” in the non-zero area. Quickly remove the IP address from both the interfaces in area 0 and router the may crash.

Workaround: Changes to the reconfiguration procedure will avoid the crash.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Shutdown the interface before removing the IP

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Remove the IP from one interface in area 0, wait for a few seconds and remove the IP address from the second interface in area 0.

* CSCul94087

Symptom: Output Packet drops is observed on the ATM IMA interface even when there is no live traffic and only signaling exchange between non-Cisco devices. Although output drops in most cases means low bandwidth issues but in this case, an entire site was down due to these drops.

Conditions: This symptom occurs under the following conditions:

 1. Layer 2 cross connect is configured on Cisco device and Non-Cisco device at other end.

 2. Only signalling traffic flows through the devices.

 3. IMA group is created for the ATM connectivity.

 4. SPA-24CHT1-CE-ATM card is to be used for the ATM connection.

Workaround: Reload the SPA.

* CSCul96778

Symptom: A router may crash and reload with BGP related traceback in an extremely rare timing condition while running “show ip bgp vpnv4 vrf XXXX nei A.A.A.A”.

Conditions: While making BGP related changes such as moving the same neighbor with quick operation of “no neighbor x.x.x.x “ and then “neighbor x.x.x.x” across VRFs. Immediately after this if we type a “show ip bgp vpnv4 vrf XXXX nei A.A.A.A” on a Cisco router running IOS and BGP, then in extremely rare timing condition the router may crash. The possibility of this to happen increases if their configuration and unconfiguration is done from one console and the show operation done from other console.

Workaround: When doing configuration and un-configuration and then show, its better to serialize the operation rather than aggressively use multiple consoles to do all actions at the same time.

* CSCum00056

Symptom: ASR IOSd crash occurs with the following error:

UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = ISG CMD HANDLER

Conditions: This symptom occurs when changes are made through RADIUS.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCum02221

Symptom: A vulnerability in BGP processing code of Cisco IOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device..

The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of malformed BGP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed BGP packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the device configured for BGP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCum14830

Symptom: Leaking IPv6 routes is observed from a VRF table into the global table using BGP. These routes consist of the following: 1. BGP routes learned from the VRF IPv6 BGP peer. 2. Redistributed static and connected routes.

The BGP routes leak fine, but the redistributed static and connected routes have an issue. After the redistributed routes leak, the exit interface shows “null0”. Sometimes instead of showing the exit interface as “null0”, it shows a random interface which is a part of VRF and has IPv6 enabled on it.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with IPv6 redistributed connected and static routes into BGP VRF (could also be redistributed from other protocols as well but have not been tested).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCum16315

Symptom: Upon reload of a Cisco 7600 router configured with a CoPP policy containing IPv6 ACLs and DSCP matching, the CoPP is only applied to the active RSP as shown below.

After reload:

* CSCum17958

Symptom: An IOSd crash is observed during a configuration replace.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on configuration with a port-channel interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCum24565

Symptom:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) MPLS is being processed by the CPU instead of HW switching.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) rem com sw show mls vlan-ram shows “0” value under vpn-num and netdr shows that mpls is being processed by the CPU:

Example: 7600# rem comm sw sh mls vlan-ram 1906 1906

TYCHO Vlan RAM Key: \* => Set, - => Clear

There is a possibility of a high CPU due to interrupts.

Conditions: The symptom may occur on the Cisco 7600 Series Routers after an SSO is performed on PE with L2VPN in PFC VLAN mode.

Workaround:

 1. Remove xconnect configuration from the subinterface and reconfigure it.

 2. Shut/no shut the xconnect source interface.

* CSCum61595

Symptom: Alignment errors are observed after upgrading to Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M5.

Jan 9 19:42:59.623 GMT: %ALIGN-3-CORRECT: Alignment correction made at 0x6477F81Cz reading 0x6BE87495 Jan 9 19:42:59.623 GMT: %ALIGN-3-TRACE: -Traceback= 0x6477F81Cz 0x647805D0z 0x6478FE70z 0x64751088z 0x64B99F4Cz 0x64B99FD4z 0x64752 284z 0x647525ACz

Conditions: This symptom does not occur under specific conditions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCum65604

Symptom: A Cisco router gets crashed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when shut/no shut is performed on the access interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCum85813

Symptom: Shut primary static router and secondary static is not installed automatically.

Conditions: This symptom is seen on the sites where the BFD state of the backup static route is marked as “U” in the output of “show ip static route bfd”.

Workaround: Reinstall the default backup static route.

* CSCum95330

Symptom: Removing an Ethernet service instance which is a member of a bridge domain may cause the router to reload.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the last service instance is removed from the bridge domain and there are still members of the bridge domain which are not service instances (such as VFIs).

Workaround: Completely unconfigure the bridge domain and reconfigure it.

* CSCun10381

Symptom: A traffic drop was observed because labels do not get programmed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when scalable EoMPLS with L3VPN is configured. When notifications on atom-imps arrive, they have to get programmed.

Workaround: Clear ip route.

More Info: Traffic was seen to be dropped as the atom-imps could not be programmed because label entry could not be found for the atom-imps.

* CSCun11782

Symptom: Rtfilter prefixes are sent with incorrect next-hop equal to next-hop of the default static route in GRT instead of BGP router-id.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with a default static route present in GRT pointing, for example, to the next-hop known behind the connected interface.

Workaround: Replace the default static route with a more specific static route or remove static and clear BGP.

* CSCun13688

Symptom: The Cisco Catalyst 6500 Supervisor Engine 2T with CLNS routing configured crashes after show clnbs route.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when CLNS routing is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCun20187

Symptom: HSRP communication fails between two PEs (Cisco 7600 Series router) right after removing a neighbor from VFI.

Conditions: Assume that a VPLS circuit is running between more than two PEs say A,B, and C and HSRP is running between A and B. Removing VPLS peer C on either A or B would cause HSRP communication failure between A and B. This failure is not expected as data path is still available between A and B.

Workaround: Perform shut/no shut on the SVI.

* CSCun24813

Symptom: In an HA setup, on standby reload, an active crash occurs.

Conditions: There are a few states maintained on active for the tunnel reserved and tunnel global VLANs depending on the status of their usage (the one trying to free the VLAN).

When the standby frees the VLAN, the state of VLAN is set to 2 on active. But in this case when the state of VLAN is set to 2, and the standby is reloaded, the active crashes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

More Info: In an HA setup there are states maintained for the VLAN on active, depending on the active or standby that has freed it. There are 4 states : State 1: When the active wants to free the VLAN and is waiting for a message from the standby to free the VLAN. In this case, VLAN is put in delay list for 4 minutes.

State 0: When VLAN is freed by the active, the state is set to 1.

State 2 : When VLAN is freed by the standby, the state is set to 2.

State 3 : Same as State 1 for global rsvd VLAN.

Cases :

Case 1: The active wants to free the VLAN, waits for a message from the standby, set the state to 1, before 4 minutes standby frees the VLAN and sends the message to active, the state is set to 0.

Case 2 : The active wants to free the VLAN first, set the state to 1, within 4 minutes if a message from the standby does not arrive, the state is set to 0. After 4 minutes the standby frees the VLAN and sends the message to active, and the state is set to 2.

Case 3: The standby wants to free the VLAN first, sends a message to the active, the state is set to 2, the active also frees it, and sets the state to 0 finally.

Now when a peer reload is done, all the VLANs which are in delay list waiting for the standby message are to be freed. Here we check if the state of the VLAN is not 0, it is set to 0 and freed. In case 2, the state of the VLAN after it is deleted from the active and the standby is 2, so on reload an attempt to again free these VLANs is made, hence the crash.

* CSCun31021

Symptom: A vulnerability in IKE module of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect already established Security Associations (SA)..

* CSCup23792

Symptom: A loss of service-group configuration under a subinterface is observed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs only when the router is reloaded. It is not seen with a particular LC reload where the interface exists.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCup53658

Symptom: q-in-q subinterfaces on a Cisco ASR 1000 Series router do not show correct traffic statistics via SNMP ifTable/ifXTable or CLI (show vlans dot1q).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the subinterface is configured under a port channel. The issue is not seen when the subinterface is a part of the physical interface.

Workaround: Traffic statistics via CLI can be obtained directly from the SPA by using the following command for each member interface of the port channel:

Using Gi1/3/0 as an example:

request platform software console attach 1/3

(Note: On Cisco ASR 1000 releases prior to XE 3.2 this command may fail. If so, use the hidden command: ipc-con <slot> <bay>)

show hw-module subslot 0 tcam all\_entries vlan brief

Note the VLANs (denoted by V1 and V2) for which statistics are required.

Example: Slot-0-0>show hw-module subslot 0 tcam all\_entries vlan brief ADDR PO V1 V2 C1 C2 ETYPE QVASN IPF IT IACL IRID EPF ET EACL ERID VVID PV PS DA SCTH FE RGN 2076 00 2005 1507 00 00 0000 18 2212 00 0004 0000 0002 00 0004 0000 0000 C0 00 00 0000 00 6

Use the following command to get VLAN TCAM statistics for the TCAM with address 2076 (that handles q-in-q for VLAN 2005 and 1507 as per V1 and V2 columns)

Output will be like the following:

show hw-module subslot 0 tcam counters vlan 2076 VLAN Rx Hit : Pkt: 1066 VLAN Rx Unicast Send : Pkt: 1065 Byte: 126102 VLAN Rx Mcast Send : Pkt: 0 Byte: 0 VLAN Rx Bcast Send : Pkt: 1 Byte: 64 VLAN Rx Osub Drop : Pkt: 0 Byte: 0 VLAN Tx Hit : Pkt: 1066 VLAN Tx Ucast Send : Pkt: 1064 Byte: 126038 VLAN Tx Mcast Send : Pkt: 0 Byte: 0 VLAN Tx Bcast Send : Pkt: 2 Byte: 128

Alternatively to avoid the need to look up the TCAM address beforehand, you can use the following syntax:

show hw-module subslot 0 tcam entry vlan 0 first-vlan-tag second-vlan-tag 0 8 8 | i Pkt

The Hit counters represent overall TX/RX packet counters. The RX/TX send represent packet and byte counts for Unicast, Multicast and Broadcast Respectively

Note: The only way to clear the counters is to remove and readd the member interface from the port channel.

* CSCup66424

Symptom: A Cisco router fails to send out any packet. The link status is up/up, but no packet is sent out the interface.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when one interface is connected and the link status is up.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when using a local connect between an EFP with encap dot1q and an EFP with encap untagged.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc41531

Symptoms: Forwarding loop is observed for some PfR-controlled traffic.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Traffic Classes (TCs) are controlled via PBR.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The parent route is withdrawn on selected BR/exit.

Workaround: This issue does not affect configured or statically defined applications, but only affects learned applications so this can be used as one workaround. Another option is to issue shut/no shut on PfR master or clear the related TCs with the clear pfr master traffic-class... command (this fixes the issue until the next occurrence).

* CSCuc99750

Symptom: EIGRP routes, that are not Feasible Successor are getting into the routing table.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you increase variance and maximum paths.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud63146

Symptoms: In a GETVPN scenario, the GM fails to install policies on reload. A crypto map is applied on ethernet 0/0 while the local address of the crypto map is configured with ethernet 0/1.1

Conditions: This symptom occurs after a reload. The GM fails to install policies from the key server.

Workaround: Remove the crypto map configuration on the interface and reapply.

* CSCue68714

Symptom: Newer released IOS-XE BGP, post Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S/XE3.7 not forming BFD session with the older implementations. This happens when using eBGP multi-hop to peer between two loopback interfaces on directly connected routers.

Conditions: This ddts adds a couple of options “[single-hop | multi-hop]” to the existing BGP-BFD knob “neighbor x.x.x.x fall-over [bfd] [check-control-plane-failure]”.

So, after the change the knob would be: “neighbor x.x.x.x fall-over [bfd] [single-hop | multi-hop] [check-control-plane-failure]”

\*\*Note: Existing: “neighbor x.x.x.x fall-over [bfd]” --- This behavior would not be disturbed; so that we do not change the behavior that has been released as part of all the releases for more than three years now.

Add-on in this ddts:

1) “neighbor x.x.x.x fall-over [bfd] [single-hop] -- NEW-option “single-hop”; would force BGP to open a single-hop bfd session. Even in case of back-to-back ebgp update-source loopback with 2 hop BGP peering.

2) “neighbor x.x.x.x fall-over [bfd] [multi-hop] -- NEW-option “multi-hop”"; would force BGP to open a multi-hop bfd session.

Workaround: There is no work around. ISR G2 should support BFD multi-hop feature.

More Info: ISR-G2 does not support multi-hop BFD, while ISR4400 supports multi-hop BFD. BFD multi-hop support for ISR-G2 needs to be provided, so that they can interop with ISR4400 and ASRs.

* CSCue95644

Symptom: This is the Cisco response to research performed by Mr. Philipp Schmidt and Mr. Jens Steube from the Hashcat Project on the weakness of Type 4 passwords on Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE devices. Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Steube reported this issue to the Cisco PSIRT on March 12, 2013.

Cisco would like to thank Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Steube for sharing their research with Cisco and working toward a coordinated disclosure of this issue.

A limited number of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE releases based on the Cisco IOS 15 code base include support for a new algorithm to hash user-provided plaintext passwords. This algorithm is called Type 4, and a password hashed using this algorithm is referred to as a Type 4 password. The Type 4 algorithm was designed to be a stronger alternative to the existing Type 5 and Type 7 algorithms to increase the resiliency of passwords used for the enable secret password and username username secret password commands against brute-force attacks.

* CSCug97383

Symptom: Switch crashes with EOAM and IP SLA Ethernet-monitor configurations.

Conditions: This issue occurs infrequently when EOAM configuration include VLANs. Does not occur if all EOAM configurations are configured with only Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVC).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug99771

Symptom: The OSPF N2 default route is missing from the spoke upon reloading the hub. The hub has a static default route configured and sends that route over the DMVPN tunnel running OSPF to spoke. When the hub is reloaded, the default route is missing on the spoke. NSSA-External LSA is present on the spoke after reload, but the routing bit is not set. Hence, it is not installed in RIB on the spoke.

Conditions: Default originated using the area X nssa default-information-originate command.

Workaround: Removing & readding area X nssa default-information-originate on the hub resolves the issue.

* CSCuh09324

Symptom: UDP-based entries are not deleted from the flowmgr table resulting in a crash or poor system response with CPU hog messages being shown.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in ct5760-ipservicesk9.bin cat3k\_caa-universalk9.bin and cat4500e-universalk9.bin images

The device is configured with UDP services that originate from the device. This includes but not limited to the following features:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) TFTP

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Energy Wise

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) DNS

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco TrustSec

Workaround: Enter the following commands:

Router#config terminal

service internal

end

Router#show flowmgr

The output of this command will show many lines entries holding with the same port numbers. Disabling the feature that is being held in the flows until an upgrade can be performed, is a workaround.

A reload is required to clear the held flows.

It has exceeded normal operating temperature range.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on ES+ series linecards of Cisco 7600 Series Routers.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCui67919

Symptom: QoS policy applied on AToM SVI does not get any matches until the user removes and reapplies the policy. Once the policy is reapplied, the policy works as expected. However, the QoS counters do not get updated and the policy statistics cannot be verified with “show policy-map interface x/x”.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the xconnect is applied under SVI and the core facing line card is ES20 running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S3a.

Workaround: Reapply the policy. Please note that QoS counters in “show policy-map interface xx” will not work but the policy comes in effect after re-applying it.

* CSCui74609

Symptom: After a RSP switchover the backup pseudowire state is down and never recovers to standby state.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on CEM circuits in an SAToP environment after an SSO switchover.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCui76564

Symptom: A roaming mobile customer (example: iPASS, Boingo etc.) logs on via a Web-Portal-Page and the ISG doesn’t send in the radius accounting-request packet from the V-Cookie to the Radius Server.

Conditions: This symptom occurs depending on the ISG setup. In this case L & V Cookie must be sent in accounting-request from the ISG to the AAA Server.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCui82757

Symptom: Session query responses in lite sessions have inconsistent calling-station-ID behavior.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when:

 1. Walkby feature is enabled with L4R & PBHK features applied to lite session.

 2. Session query is sent to ISG.

Workaround: Do not use calling-station-ID.

* CSCui82817

Symptom: A tunnel with lower absolute metric is not advertised properly.

Conditions: This symptom occurs under the following conditions:

 1. When there are multiple tunnels to a destination.

 2. The tunnel with a better metric comes up.

 3. When ISIS is used as IGP and both L1 and L2 are present and configured for TE.

Workaround: Clear the ISIS sessions.

* CSCui83823

Symptom: When CU executes show tech or any show commands which gives a long output using putty the SSH2 putty closes prematurely.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when “term length 0” is enabled, the putty session closes prematurely while executing show tech show memory.

Workaround: Redirect the output to a file.

* CSCui85019

Symptom: When the command show xconnect is entered, it may result in a memory leak. This can be observed by entering the command show memory debug leaks chunks and seeing entries like this:

router#show memory debug leaks chunks

Adding blocks for GD...

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCui89069

Symptom: An ISIS flap is observed on performing SSO.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when nsf ietf is configured and one or more loopbacks are configured as passive interfaces.

Workaround 1. Use nsf cisco.

Workaround 2. Continue to use nsf ietf but configure ip router isis <process\_name> on the loopback interfaces.

* CSCui90811

Symptom: While running the Cisco IOS 15.3S release and Cisco IOS 15.4S release software for the L2VPN pseudowire redundancy feature on a Cisco router, the traffic is dropped when the primary pseudowire becomes active.

Conditions: Initially the primary pseudowire is down due to either a local or a remote core-facing interface being shutdown. The backup pseudowire is active and traffic flows through the backup pseudowire. Later, when the backup pseudowire is down, the primary pseudowire is brought up and becomes active and traffic is not able to flow through primary pseudowire and is dropped.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCui99031

Symptom: In a pair of Cisco 7609-S routers running c7600rsp72043-advipservicesk9-mz.151-3.S5.bin IOS, phase 1 fails to establish due to a “signature invalid!” error when rsa-sig is used for phase 1 authentication.

Conditions: This symptom occurs under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) rsa-sig is used for phase 1 authentication

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) site to site tunnel

Workaround: Use PSK instead of PKI.

* CSCuj00746

Symptom: On performing an upgrade from 9.512 to 9.523, there is a label allocation failure in VPWS circuits as they are trying to utilize the labels that are already used by the VPLS circuits that are present in the database.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when both VPWS and VPLS circuits are configured on the same node before upgrading.

Workaround: Removing the VPLS circuit brings up the VPWS circuits. Reconfiguring the VPLS circuit is also successful with a different local label assigned.

* CSCuj11232

Symptom: Changing the local label on an existing static (no signaling) Any Transport over MPLS (AToM) pseudowire, or changing the static pseudowire to a dynamic one (with LDP signaling) may cause traffic to fail to traverse the pseudowire.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when either the configured value of the static local label is changed, or if the pseudowire is changed to a dynamic one.

Workaround: Completely unconfigure the existing xconnect or pseudowire before entering the new configuration.

* CSCuj11576

Symptom: A router experiences a crash when BFD is configured.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when BFD is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj16742

Symptom: In a pseudowire redundancy configuration, packets may fail to flow even though the xconnect virtual circuit appears to be up.

Conditions: This symptom has been observed when the xconnect is re-provisioned while the primary pseudowire is down and the backup pseudowire is up. The issue has only been observed on Circuit Emulation (CEM) attachment circuits, but it is possible other attachment circuit types may be affected as well.

Workaround: Completely unconfigure the xconnect and then reconfigure it.

* CSCuj17482

Symptom: On a device running low on memory, an EFP is attempted to be deleted, but fails due to lack of memory. The second attempt at removing that same EFP causes the router to restart.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the a lot of configuration has been applied to the device, causing high memory usage.

Workaround: Do not overconfigure the device.

* CSCuj22189

Symptom: On a Cisco ASR series router, a crash occurs when mpls ip is added under the interface.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the hidden command snmp-server hc poll is already configured.

Workaround: Ensure that the hidden command snmp-server hc poll has not been configured.

* CSCuj26593

Symptom: Simple IP Dual stack and IPv6 sessions failed to survive an RP switchover.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the dual stack session exists.

Workaround: Do not use the dual stack session.

* CSCuj30702

Symptom: This bug is specific to port channel sub interface configuration in ES+ card. This bug is not relevant to any other port channel configuration in ES+, that is, EVC/Bridge-Domain over PoCH sub-int etc, and other card types, such as ES20/ LAN cards are free from this bug. Any type of IP communication on port channel sub interfaces in ES+ cards fail. Such an issue is seen only with port channel sub interfaces on ES+ and not seen with port channel main interfaces.

Conditions: This symptom will only be seen with images where the fix of CSCuh40617 is integrated.

Workaround: The connections will work fine if it is moved to the main interface or by using EVC BD configurations.

* CSCuj31090

Symptom: When L2TPv3-based pseudowire is configured between two PE routers and different VLAN ids are used on the ACs on both sides, ES+ on egress PE does not rewrite a dot1q VLAN tag when sending a frame toward CE.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when:

 1. Both ACs are Ethernet VLAN type.

 2. Different dot1q tag is used on both ACs.

Workaround: Configure the same dot1q tag for the ACs on both PEs.

* CSCuj39400

Symptom: A Cisco 3945 series router running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)T2 may crash with a bus error. This relates to VOIP\_RTCP.

Conditions: This symprom has been observed to occur often while running SIP debugs. However, at least one identical crash happened after SIP debugs were disabled three days before.

Workaround: There is no known workaround.

* CSCuj47554

Symptom: PBHK bundles are not released even after the session is cleared.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after the session is cleared and the port-bundle status is not shown correctly with show ip portbundle status command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj52396

Symptom: In a VPLS Inter-Autonomous System Option B configuration, the virtual circuits between the Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) and the PE may fail to come up.

Conditions: This symptom is observed while initially establishing VCs after the ASBR has reloaded.

Workaround: The clear xconnect exec command can be used to clear the VCs that are down.

* CSCuj57367

Symptom: A 10 gig line card crashes on a Cisco 7600 platform with the following or similar errors:

%SYS-DFC3-3-MGDTIMER: Uninitialized timer, timer stop, timer = 30CCCFB0. -Process= "RO Notify Timers", ipl= 0, pid= 7 -Traceback= 2060E1BCz 2060E8E4z %SYS-DFC3-3-MGDTIMER: Uninitialized timer, timer stop, timer = 30CCD154. -Process= "RO Notify Timers", ipl= 0, pid= 7 -Traceback= 2060E1BCz 2060E8E4z %SYS-DFC3-3-MGDTIMER: Uninitialized timer, timer stop, timer = 30CCCFB0. -Process= "RO Notify Timers", ipl= 0, pid= 7 -Traceback= 2060E1BCz 2060E8E4z

08:54:43 Central Tue Oct 1 2013: Address Error (load or instruction fetch) exception, CPU signal 10, PC = 0x20642A08

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a large number of IPC messages are used.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

More Info: On mac-scaling, the L2-DRV application sends more ICC messages(though not always). But periodically( approximately 2-3 minutes), some burst of around 150 ICC messages are sent by the SP towards the RP. This means that mac-scaling has a direct correlation with the number of IPC messages being sent.

* CSCuj58299

Symptom: Interface input queue starts to become congested. The input queue can reach the input queue maximum which will cause problems for all control-plane and punted traffic (management, routing protocols, call control, etc).

Example from the  **show interface** output:

Input queue: 76/75/0/5549 (size/max/drops/flushes); Total output drops: 0

It may seem like the router becomes “unresponsive” and may require a reboot to restore service. Access from the console will still be possible. After some time, the input queue can clear on its own.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

 1. Router serves as a SIP-SIP CUBE

 2. Packets that are congesting input queue are RTCP packets. Check "show buffers input-interface [interface] packet". (RTCP packets are most commonly odd source/destination UDP ports in the range 16384 - 32768)

 3. CUBE receives a 180 without SDP followed by a 180 with SDP on one of the call legs (collect ’debug ccsip message’ for a period of time leading up to and including when you see the input queue begin to fill)

Workaround: Perform the following workaround:

 1. Increase input hold-queue to a very large value.

 2. Create an ACL to block RTCP traffic on interfaces (not possible if RTCP is used for inactivity detection).

 3. Influence downstream call flows such that CUBE does not receive 180 without SDP followed by a 180 with SDP.

* CSCuj60533

Symptom: Repeated CPUHOG messages may be seen along with a crash when “reload” is issued just after a bootup.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the line cards are still booting up and are in other states.

Workaround: Issue “reload” after the line cards have booted.

* CSCuj65057

Symptom: The ip vrf forwarding command under “aaa” is deleted after reloading the stack master.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after reloading the stack master switch.

aaa new-model

!

aaa group server tacacs+ TACACS+

ip vrf forwarding VRF01

!

ip vrf VRF01

rd x.x.x.x ---------

Workaround: Use the vrf definition command instead of the ip vrf command to define vrf. (This command is supported on Cisco IOS Release 12.2(58)SE or later releases.)

* CSCuj66352

Symptom: A system crash is observed in the SNMP engine.

Conditions: This symptom occurs under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ?show subscriber session?

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) polling the ISG-MIB

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) clearing the subscriber

Workaround: Do not use SNMP polling.

* CSCuj68932

Symptom: L2TPv3 tunnel with digest fails to establish. Cisco IOS device gives the following messages when “debug l2tp all” and “debug l2tp packet detail” are enabled:

L2TP \_\_\_\_\_:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_: ERROR: SCCRQ AVP 59, vendor 0: unknown L2TP \_\_\_\_\_:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_: Unknown IETF AVP 59 in CM SCCRQ

Conditions: This issue is observed when IOS device peers with non-IOS device that sends IETF L2TPv3 digest AVP (IETF AVP 59) in L2TP control message. This issue is present in S images starting from Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)XNC and in T train from Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2)T.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj75952

Symptom: The Cisco ASR 1000 route processor reloads.

Conditions: This symptom occurs during PPPoA session establishment if CAC determines that resources are low and HW-assisted CAC needs to be enabled. The router is used to terminate PPPoA sessions and Call Admission Control (CAC) is enabled.

Workaround: Disable Call Admission Control.

* CSCuj78636

Symptom: A memory leak is observed in the IP Switching segment.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if a subscriber roams with the same MAC address but a different IP address. This happens only for L2 roaming and not for L3 roaming.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj88523

Symptom: In a pseudowire redundancy configuration, traffic may fail to flow after a switchover to a backup pseudowire.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on the Cisco 7600 series routers.

Workaround: Execute the following commands on the attachment circuit interface:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) shutdown

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) no shutdown

* CSCuj96893

Symptom: Cisco router hangs and it stopped passing the traffic. Customer needs to reload the router to make it work until it hangs next time. It hangs sometimes once in month.

Conditions: This issue is seen with more than one router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuj99537

Symptom: Not all LI streams that are properly configured via SNMPv3 and appropriate ACLs and are programmed in TCAM, are intercepted and forwarded towards MD.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in an SIP-400 based LI.

Workaround: Remove and reapply the problematic tap but it doesn’t prevent the problem from reoccurring if new LI taps are applied via SNMPv3

* CSCuj99819

Symptom: MVPN GRE tunnels are not established.

Conditions: BGP has a VPN peer configured using an update-source that does not have PIM enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCul11995

Symptom: An L2TPv3 session fails to establish and Cisco IOS receives a StopCCN message from the peer with the following message in response to its ICRP message:

“No handler for attr 68 (68)”

Conditions: This symptom occurs when IOS device peers with non-IOS devices send IETF L2TPv3 Pseudowire Type AVP (IETF AVP 68) in an ICRP message.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCul14571

Symptom: A Cisco router can crash after OSPFv3 is unconfigured from an interface.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when NSR is enabled.

Workaround: Unconfigure NSR before unconfiguring OSPFv3 from an interface.

More Info: This is extremely rare issue; the OSPFv3 should be in a process of checkpointing LSA from primary RP to standby while an interface from which the LSA was received is unconfigured.

* CSCul24682

Symptom: L2TP LNS puts a non-negotiated magic number to LCP packets. The PPPoE client may terminate the session prematurely due to the unknown magic number.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when L2TP LAC does not negotiate the magic number with the PPPoE client and L2TP LNS does not renegotiate options with the PPPoE client.

Workaround: Configure “lcp renegotiation always” on L2TP LNS.

* CSCul27327

Symptom: On the Cisco c7600 router, if PIM is configured on the port-channel and on the port members, any failure on one of the port members will disable the FE CAM.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when PIM is configured on the port members.

Workaround:

 1. Do not configure PIM sparse-mode on the port members even though the CLI is accepted.

 2. In case the PIM sparse-mode is configured on the port members, remove it from the port members and the port-channel and then reapply the PIM configuration on the port-channel only.

Further Problem Description: A similar issue (CSCtf75608) is seen on the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches, but the workaround is to configure PIM on the port-channel and the port members to avert the FE CAM to be disabled in the event of one of the port members failing.

* CSCul40898

Symptom: After reloading the router or fresh service-instance configuration, traffic received from the access is sent to the core without a dummy VLAN header. This traffic is received by a remote PE2 and sent to switch with a missing VLAN header. Therefore CE2 drops received packets. When the issue is removed, captured traffic in the core contains a dummy VLAN header.

Conditions: This symptom is occasionally observed when the router is reloaded and is consistently observed when a new service instance is configured as an xconnect member.

Workaround: Perform shutdown followed by no shutdown on the service instance.

* CSCul47135

Symptom: On Cisco ASR 1000 routers, services are not removed or applied from the active subscriber sessions when CoA is sent from the radius server. The router sends wrong values in response to the CoA request packet.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when 15.2(20130918:081157) is run.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCul54254

Symptom: Invalid LSAs are not flushed by the router which has their Advertising Router ID. Specifically, Router LSAs which do not have LSID of 0 will not be flushed if the router does not re-originate them, and any LSA with a type that the router does not recognize.

Lingering LSAs could lead to incorrect routing in some very obscure instances. For example, stale Router LSA fragments from two neighboring routers would need to remain in the network. There would not be a routing problem if only one router’s stale Router LSA fragment was allowed to linger.

Conditions: There are several possible scenarios that could lead to this symptom. One example is that a router is configured with many interfaces attached to an OSPFv3 instance such that it originates more than one Router LSA fragment. Then the router is reloaded before the configuration is saved, and after the reload it does not reoriginate some of the Router LSA fragments.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCul65614

Symptom: The FAN-MOD-6SHS module consumes more power than expected(should be around 180W).

#sh power

<SNIP>

Fan Type Watts A @42V State

---- ------------------ ------- ------ -----

1 FAN-MOD-6SHS 427.14 10.17 OK

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the ES+ Combo card is placed in slot-1 of 7600 chassis.

Workaround: Place ES+ Combo cards in any other slot other than slot-1 of 7600 chassis.

* CSCul86211

Symptom: When LNS switches off while the sessions keep on establishing at LAC, LAC finds the l2tp db memory exhausted after sometime. Due to this, it fails to update the session in the database and during this period a crash is observed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when LAC tries to add l2tp session in the database and fails to do so. In order to handle this error condition, LAC frees the l2tp and l2x session twice. This double free is the reason for crash.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCul87037

Symptom: An “sg subrte conte” chunk leak occurs while roaming.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after an account-logoff and if service permit is configured in control policy. In case of a service permit, the subscriber remains unauth and is redirected to the portal once again. Post successful second account logon and the subscriber session is cleared by timeout or cli, the leak is seen and the same client will not be able to create the session once again. The leak is seen after simulating for the second time account-logon. And if service permit is configured.

In case of service disconnect configured under account-logoff, account-logon is not a practical scenario as the portal is not reachable for the client.

Workaround: Use service disconnect for event account-logoff.

class type control always event account-logoff

1 service disconnect delay 10

!

* CSCul92497

Symptom: The Cisco 7600 router providing layer2 EoMPLS services may stop forwarding ingress and egress traffic for an xconnect for which a backup peer config has been applied.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in Cisco 7600 routers running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S4a with ES+ cards (access/core facing) and xconnect configured under a service instance.

Workaround: Clear the xconnect on the Cisco 7600 router side. Clearing on the remote size does not have an effect.

* CSCum65501

Symptom: IPv6 CoPP ACL in PI matches traffic incorrectly for sw-switched paks. Packets are not hit against IPv6 ACE matching on L4 protocol. This causes traffic to be classified incorrectly.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with recent Cisco IOS images. Results are as expected on Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE9a. However, it is broken in Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S4a onwards.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

### Resolved Caveats—Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S4a

Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S4a is a rebuild release that addresses a critical issue impacting 7600 platform for Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S.

* CSCuj30702

Symptom: This bug is specific to port channel sub interface configuration in ES+ card. This bug is not relevant to any other port channel configuration in ES+, that is, EVC/Bridge-Domain over PoCH sub-int etc, and other card types, such as ES20/ LAN cards are free from this bug. Any type of IP communication on port channel sub interfaces in ES+ cards fail. Such an issue is seen only with port channel sub interfaces on ES+ and not seen with port channel main interfaces.

Conditions: This symptom will only be seen with images where the fix of CSCuh40617 is integrated.

Workaround: The connections will work fine if it is moved to the main interface or by using EVC BD configurations.

### Resolved Caveats—Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S4

Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S4 is a rebuild release for Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S. The caveats in this section are resolved in Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S4 but may be open in previous Cisco IOS releases.

* CSCsv74508

Symptom: If a linecard is reset (either due to an error or a command such as hw-module slot reload) at the precise time an SNMP query is trying to communicate with that linecard, the RP could reset due to a CPU vector 400 error.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the linecard is reset(either due to error or a command such as hw-module slot reload) at the precise time an SNMP query is received.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtd45679

Symptom: The standby supervisor reloads after removing an IPSLA probe via CLI:

R7600(config)#no ip sla 1 R7600(config)# 06:53:31: Config Sync: Line-by-Line sync verifying failure on command: no ip sla 1 due to parser return error

06:53:31: rf\_reload\_peer\_stub: RP sending reload request to Standby. User: Config-Sync, Reason: Configuration mismatch R7600(config)# 06:53:31: %RF-SP-5-RF\_RELOAD: Peer reload.

Conditions: This issue only occurs if the probe is configured via SNMP.

Workaround: Remove the probe via SNMP.

More Info: This issue is applicable to a Cisco Catalyst 6500 platform running Cisco IOS 12.2SX releases. It may also affect other high availability (HA) platforms running Cisco IOS 12.2 or 15.X releases.

* CSCtj61284

Symptoms: NAT overload does not work for non-directly connected destinations in MPLS-VPN configurations.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with NAT overload configured to NAT traffic coming over an MPLS VPN to internet (via a VRF-enabled interface).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtr88785

Symptoms: Following an upgrade from Cisco IOS Release 12.4(24)T2 to Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M1, crashes were experienced in PKI functions.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco 3845 running the c3845-advipservicesk9-mz.151-4.M1 image with a PKI certificate server configuration.

Workaround: Disable Auto-enroll on the CA/RA. Manually enroll when needed.

* CSCts63581

Symptoms: The standby PRE4 resets after write memory command at “Failed to sync private-config to standby RP”.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a scaled configuration that is more than NVRAM can store.

This may occur when the standby NVRAM is locked by some other process and when config sync tries to access the standby NVRAM it fails. It then restarts the standby.

Workaround: Significantly decrease configuration size, if possible.

* CSCtx99353

Symptom: %SYS-3-INVMEMINT: Invalid memory action (malloc) at interrupt level.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when music on hold (MOH) is enabled.

Workaround:

 1. Remove the route list from the multicast MOH CLI, so that you can still have music on hold and can continue the feature.

 2. Disable the MOH (but no music comes on hold).

* CSCty26035

Symptom:

 1. There is a discrepancy in the inbound and the outbound SA lifetime in the standby router.

 2. The KB lifetime in a standby router is greater than that of the active router, when a KB lifetime rekey occurs.

 3. The ping will not go through after applying a dynamic crypto map.

Conditions: The issues are seen after establishing the session between the HA routers and various test conditions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty59423

Symptoms: Memory leak seen with following messages:

Alternate Pool: None Free: 0 Cause: No Alternate pool -Process= "VOIP\_RTCP", ipl= 0, pid= 299 -Traceback= 0x25B1F0Cz 0x25AB6CBz 0x25B1029z 0x46C02Ez 0x46C89Bz 0x46BCC2z 0x471D12z 0x43EF59Ez 0x43DD559z 0x43DCF90z %SYS-2-MALLOCFAIL: Memory allocation of 780 bytes failed from 0x46C02E, alignment 32

Conditions: The conditions are unknown.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty77441

Symptom: Memory leaks are observed after unconfiguring BFD sessions.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after BFD sessions are unconfigured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz90697

Symptoms: EIGRP authentication is not working.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when authentication is configured with key-id 0.

Workaround: Use any other key-id for authentication.

* CSCua21049

Symptom: User configures a recursive multicast-only IPv6 static route. Although the static route next-hop apparently resolves in the context of the ipv6 multicast-unicast routing table, the route is not inserted in the routing table.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a user has configured IPv6 multicast. User has configured a recursive multicast-only ipv6 static route.

For example:

A user has configured recursive multicast-only static:

ipv6 route 2001:DB8:11::1/128 2001:DB8:16::1 multicast

Next-hop apparently resolves in context of the multicast-unicast routing table:

rtr> show ipv6 routing multicast IPv6 Multicast Routing Table - default - 8 entries Codes: C - Connected, L - Local, S - Static, U - Per-user Static route B - BGP, R - RIP, H - NHRP, I1 - ISIS L1 I2 - ISIS L2, IA - ISIS interarea, IS - ISIS summary, D - EIGRP EX - EIGRP external, ND - ND Default, NDp - ND Prefix, DCE - Destination NDr - Redirect, O - OSPF Intra, OI - OSPF Inter, OE1 - OSPF ext 1 OE2 - OSPF ext 2, ON1 - OSPF NSSA ext 1, ON2 - OSPF NSSA ext 2 ls - LISP site, ld - LISP dyn-EID C 2001:DB8:16::/112 [0/0] via Ethernet0/1, directly connected

However, the static route is not present in routing table and “show ipv6 static multicast detail” shows the route resolves outside the table:

rtr> show ipv6 static multicast detail IPv6 Static routes Table - default Codes: \* - installed in RIB, u/m - Unicast/Multicast only U - Per-user Static route N - ND Static route M - MIP Static route P - DHCP-PD Static route R - RHI Static route m 2001:DB8:11::1/128 via 16::1, multicast distance 1 Route resolves outside the table

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua35161

Symptom: On the DMVPN HUB, some crypto maps still exist after removing Tunnel protection from the Tunnel interface.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with scaling test.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua55797

Symptoms: The privilege exec level 0 show glbp brief command causes the memory to be depleted when the show running or copy running-config startup-config commands are used. The configurations will then show this:

privilege exec level 0 show glbp GigabitEthernet0/0 brief brief brief brief brief brief brief privilege exec level 0 show glbp GigabitEthernet0/0 brief brief brief brief brief brief privilege exec level 0 show glbp GigabitEthernet0/0 brief brief brief brief brief privilege exec level 0 show glbp GigabitEthernet0/0 brief brief brief brief privilege exec level 0 show glbp GigabitEthernet0/0 brief brief brief privilege exec level 0 show glbp GigabitEthernet0/0 brief brief privilege exec level 0 show glbp GigabitEthernet0/0 brief privilege exec level 0 show glbp privilege exec level 0 show

Removing the configurations causes this to happen over and over until the telnet session is terminated:

priv\_push : no memory available priv\_push : no memory available priv\_push : no memory available priv\_push : no memory available priv\_push : no memory available

If the configurations are saved and device is reloaded, the device will not fully boot until the configurations are bypassed.

Conditions: This issue happens after the privilege exec level 0 show glbp brief command is entered and saved.

Workaround: Reload the router before saving the configurations.

* CSCua75781

Symptoms: CME reloads for E911 call ELIN translation for incoming FXS/FXO trunk.

Conditions: The symptom is observed from Cisco IOS interim Release 15.3(0.2)T.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub04965

Symptom: Multiple symptoms may occur including:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Multiple sessions established to TACACS+ server which never clear are seen in the output of show tcp brief.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Pings to the loopback address from directly connected equipment suffers packet loss.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Traffic and pings through the switch suffers packet loss.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) CPU utilization remained stable and below 10% when the issue was occurring, the interface counters were not reporting any errors or drops.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) TACACS+ authentication errors, authorization errors, or accounting errors.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) SSH/TELNET via VTY not accessible.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If condition exists for a period of time the switch may stop passing traffic.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the device is configured with TACACS+. It is seen mostly on Cisco 3750/3760 switches, but has been observed on Cisco 6500 switches.

Workaround:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Remove the AAA and TACACS+ server configuration.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Clear the existing TCP connections with clear tcp tcb.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Reconfigure the TACACS+ server configuration to use “single-connection” mode.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Reconfigure the AAA configuration.

Mitigation using EEM: A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect a hung, extended, or indefinite TCP connection that causes the symptoms to be observed. The policy allows administrators to monitor TCP connections on a Cisco IOS device. When Cisco IOS EEM detects hung or stale TCP connections, the policy can trigger a response by sending a syslog message or a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap to clear the TCP connection. The example policy provided in this document is based on a Tcl script that monitors and parses the output from two commands at defined intervals, produces a syslog message when the monitor threshold reaches its configured value, and can reset the TCP connection. The EEM script is available at:

* CSCub18622

Symptom: Dynamic ACL does not get applied to the interface ACL, but the user shows up in the show ip auth-proxy cache command output.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when auth proxy is configured on a tunnel interface.

Workaround: Move the auth-proxy rules onto a physical interface.

* CSCub34534

Symptom: A basic call between 2 SIP phones over SIP trunk (KPML-enabled) fails.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco ISR G2 platforms.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub40547

Symptoms: ES+ module crashes with the followoing error message:

%NP\_DEV-DFC1-2-WATCHDOG: Watchdog detected on NP 0

Conditions: The issue is specific to the type of packet and its content which is unique when vidmon is configured.

Workaround: Remove vidmon configuration.

* CSCub46423

Symptoms: Connecting from Windows 7 L2TP/IPSec client to the VPN fails when using HSRP virtual IP as a gateway IP and Error 788 is displayed.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(3)T or later releases, and the Windows 7 L2TP/IPsec VPN client.

Workaround: Downgrade to Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)T.

* CSCub52278

Symptom: The DVTI Virtual Access interface may flap during rekey with a large number of IKEv2/IPSec tunnels.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when IKEv2 is used in large scale deployment.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub68199

Symptom: A Cisco Router configured for IPv6/IPv4 Native IP Routes or l2-connected ISG sessions may reload with following errors in crashinfo:

UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = IP Inband Session Initiator

Conditions: This symptom occurs due to high or extended duration of setup and tear-down rate of sessions. Time to potential reload can vary depending on call volume and duration of session cycling.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub93641

Symptom: The load balancing feature of the Flex-VPN solution of Cisco IOS does not provide authentication facilities to avoid a non authorized member to join the load balancing cluster. Thus, an attacker may impact the integrity of the Flex-VPN system by inserting a rogue cluster member and having the load balance master to forward a VPN session to it. A number of secondary effects, including black-holing of some of the VPN traffic may be triggered by this issue.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in Flex-VPN with the Load Balancing feature active.

Workaround: Using CoPP and interface access-list may be used to allow only trusted router to join the load balancer cluster

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc61302

Symptoms: The symptoms for XE38, XE37 and mcp\_dev are different for this DDTS. On mcp\_dev, VPLS PW is not coming up, but on XE37 and XE38, static mac commands are missing after a reload.

Conditions: This occurs only on reload. The configured static mac commands are missing after a reload.

Workaround: There is no workaround other than re-entering the static mac commands.

* CSCud02391

Symptoms: The EIGRP routes are not coming up after removing and reenabling the tunnel interface.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when EIGRP routes do not populate properly.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud11078

Symptoms: Removal of the service instance on the target device causes a crash.

Conditions: This symptom is not consistently reproducible on all configurations as the underlying cause is a race condition.

Workaround: De-schedule the probe before removing the service instance.

* CSCud13768

Symptom: RP crashes while trying to verify UDP-JITTER in IP SLAs VRF-lite.

Conditions: This symptom occurs while trying to verify IP SLAs UDP Jitter operation.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud24806

Symptom: Compared to V1 ATM SPA, V2 SPAs have more latency and bad bandwidth partition.

Conditions: The symptom is observed under the following conditions:

 1. V2 SPA configured in L3 QoS mode.

 2. Policy map contains “no priority queue”.

 3. Policy map has more than one QoS class.

 4. Each class has a WRED profile configured.

Workaround: While using a policy-map with a WRED profile, use the drop-probability value as 8. This improves the partition.

* CSCud45339

Symptom: The ping mpls tp tunnel-tp lsp act indicates that the LSP is unreachable even though it is functioning correctly.

Conditions: This symptom occurs during MPLS Transport Profile (TP) and OAM GAL handling.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

More Info: The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (GAL) may not be processed in the exception handling path, which impacts OAM ping mpls for tunnel-tp.

* CSCud55286

Symptoms: Traffic drops for sometime after doing a switchover.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when a switchover is performed on a Cisco ASR 903.

Workaround: Put a neighbor command where the neighbor has no meaning and will never be up. This will solve the timing issue.

* CSCud58457

Symptom: Standby interface stays UP/UP after a reload:

BGL.S.15-ASR1004-1#sh int des Interface Status Protocol Description Te0/0/0 down down Te0/1/0 up up Te0/2/0 down down Te0/3/0 up up Gi0 admin down down

It should be like this :

BGL.S.15-ASR1004-1#sh int des Interface Status Protocol Description Te0/0/0 down down Te0/1/0 up up Te0/2/0 down down Te0/3/0 standby mode down Gi0 admin down down

Conditions: The symptom is observed when “backup interface” and “carrier-delay” are configured under the interface:

interface TenGigabitEthernet0/1/0 backup interface TenGigabitEthernet0/3/0 ip address 10.163.137.29 255.255.255.224 logging event link-status carrier-delay up 1 carrier-delay down msec 0 cdp enable hold-queue 4096 in hold-queue 4096 out ! interface TenGigabitEthernet0/3/0 mac-address d867.d9dd.ff10 no ip address logging event link-status carrier-delay up 1 carrier-delay down msec 0 cdp enable hold-queue 4096 in hold-queue 4096 out !

Workaround: Flap the standby interface.

* CSCud83835

Symptoms: An IPsec VPN tunnel fails to be established. The debug crypto ipsec command shows no output when attempting to bring up the tunnel.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when all of the following conditions are met:

 1. The crypto map is configured on a Virtual-Template interface.

 2. This Virtual-Template interface is configured with “ip address negotiated”.

 3. The tunnel is initiated locally (in other words, if the tunnel is initiated by the peer, it comes up correctly).

Workaround: Downgrade to Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)T3 or earlier releases or always initiate the VPN tunnel from the peer.

* CSCud86954

Symptom: Some flows are not added to the Flexible Netflow cache, as indicated by the “Flows not added” counter increasing in the show flow monitor statistics command output. “Debug flow monitor packets” shows “FNF\_BUILD: Lost cache entry” messages, and after some time, all cache entries are lost. At that moment, debug starts showing “FLOW MON: ip input feature builder failed on interface couldn’t get free cache entry”, and no new entries are created and exported (“Current entries” counter remains at 0).

The following is sample output when all cache entries are lost:

Router#sh flow monitor FNF-MON stat Cache type: Normal Cache size: 4096 Current entries: 0 High Watermark: 882

Flows added: 15969 Flows not added: 32668 Flows aged: 15969 - Active timeout ( 1800 secs) 0 - Inactive timeout ( 15 secs) 15969 - Event aged 0 - Watermark aged 0 - Emergency aged 0

Conditions: This symptom occurs when all of the following are true:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Flexible Netflow is enabled on a DMVPN tunnel interface.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Local policy-based routing is also enabled on the router.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Local PBR references an ACL that does not exist or an ACL that matches IPsec packets.

Workaround:

 1. Make sure that the ACL used in the local PBR route-map exists and does not match IPsec packets sent over the DMVPN tunnel interface.

 2. Disabling encryption on the tunnel interface, or changing tunnel mode from mGRE to GRE also removes this bug.

 3. The issue will not be seen if FNF is not configured, or if FNF is configured but is not monitoring VPN traffic.

* CSCud88483

Symptom: In a GETVPN and IPsec redundant configuration combination, if you reload a secondary group member in the topology it will cause TEK registration of the group member to be lost once the router comes back up and the HSRP does a state transition to standby.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a GETVPN with IPsec redundancy configuration.

Workaround: Wait for the next rekey or issue clear crypto gdoi.

* CSCue01146

Symptom: SNMP GET fails for VPDN-related MIB.

Conditions: This symptom occurs while receiving an SNMP GET for the MIB before all VPDN configurations are applied.

Workaround: Reload the router.

Symptom: Active RP crash during sessions bring up after clearing PDP.

Conditions: The symptom is observed after clearing PDP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

More Info: This is a negative test where DHCP IP under APN on IWAG is the access interface IP. In real world, we do not configure access interface IP as a DHCP IP for an APN.

* CSCue25526

Symptom: Router crashes when configuring FNF interface bind.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when an interface bind is removed in a session before the first session bind is complete.

Workaround: Do not remove the bind in the second session until the first session bind is complete.

* CSCue28318

Symptoms: A Cisco router doing authentication proxy may unexpectedly reload when running the test aaa command command.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the router is using LDAP authentication and has a misconfigured LDAP authentication configuration.

Workaround: Correct the misconfiguration.

* CSCue32707

Symptom: crypto pki export <> causes crash.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in when a SUB CA trustpoint is configured and a trustpoint is configured and enrolled to that SUB CA.

Workaround: If possible, have the trustpoint on a separate box.

* CSCue39518

Symptom: A Cisco 7200 with VSA fails to encrypt traffic under specific conditions.

Conditions: The symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Issue not seen when IPsec SSO and HSRP are removed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue47586

Symptom: For an MGRE tunnel, internal VLANs are not allocated in the standby supervisor.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when an HA router boots up with MGRE tunnel configurations. Internal VLANs are not allocated in the standby supervisor due to a sync issue during bootup.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue57495

Symptom: Traceback is observed with the following error message:

standby cannot allocate VLAN for Tunnel Rsvd Vlan

Conditions: The issue seen while configuring L2VPN and L3VPN with scaled tunnel configurations.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue59592

Symptom: Multiple crashes observed with the following tracebacks after upgrading the Cisco IOS Release from 12.2(33)SRC1 to 12.2(33)SRE6:

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the Cisco 2911 running Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M3. When IP Multicast is used with NAT, in certain scenarios when NAT functionality returns error, multicast code does not free duplicate packet buffers eventually leading to exhaustion of packet buffer pool in the router.

Workaround: There is no real workaround except to disable NAT.

* CSCue74612

Symptom: FTP download fails in FTS client.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with FTS transfer over FTP via VRF.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue75986

Symptom: The active route processor crashes because of a segmentation fault in the PIM IPv6 process after de-configuring a VRF.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when BGP, multicast-routing, or a VRF is de-configured while VRF-forwarding for the affected VRF is still configured on some interfaces and IPv6 multicast state entries exist within the affected VRF.

Workaround: Before removing a VRF using no vrf definition xxx, de-configuring “router bgp...” or de-configuring multicast-routing for any VRF or for the global routing table, de-configure the IPv6 and the IPv4 MDT tunnels for affected VRFs as follows:

 1. Under the “vrf definition...”/ “address-family ipv6” configuration sub-mode, execute no mdt default....

 2. Under the “vrf definition...”/ “address-family ipv4” configuration sub-mode, execute no mdt default....

* CSCue76057

Symptom: On a SIP 400 with gigeV2 SPA, when EVC is configured with “encap default”, it is seen that sometimes the FUGU TCAM is not programmed with correct VVID for the EVC. This results in incoming traffic reaching the linecard with wrong VVID. This can impact traffic incoming on the EVC.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with an “encap default” configuration under EVC, or removal and re-application of “encap default” under EVC.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue76102

Symptoms: Redistributed internal IPv6 routes from v6 IGP into BGP are not learned by the BGP neighboring routers.

Conditions: This symptom occurs because of a software issue, due to which the internal IPv6 redistributed routes from IGPs into BGP are not advertised correctly to the neighboring routers, resulting in the neighbors dropping these IPv6 BGP updates in inbound update processing. The result is that the peering routers do not have any such IPv6 routes in BGP tables from their neighbors.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue81327

Symptoms: Standby RP crashes during bulk sync with:

Unexpected exception to CPU: vector 1400

Conditions: The crash occurs while syncing a shutdown TE tunnel interface configuration.

Workaround: Delete the shutdown TE tunnel configuration, if not required.

* CSCue89779

Symptom: A FlexVPN spoke configured with an inside VRF and front-door VRF may have problems with spoke-to-spoke tunnels if they are not the same. During tunnel negotiation, two Virtual-access interfaces are created (while only one is needed), the one in excess may fail to cleanup correctly. As a result, the routes created by NHRP process may lead to loss of traffic, or traffic may continue to flow through the Hub.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the VRF used on the overlay (IVRF) and the VRF used on the transport (FVRF) are not the same.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue94653

Symptom: When the port-security configured interface goes to blocking state (MST), the VLANs configured on the port go to not-forwarding state temporarily. The secure mac-addresses are not added back resulting in loss of traffic.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the port-security configured interface goes to blocking state.

Workaround: Shut and no shut the port-security interface to re-add the mac-addresses.

* CSCuf03079

Symptom: A Cisco IOS router running with ISIS remote-LFA configured can crash.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when shut/no shut is performed on an interface multiple times.

Workaround: Disable the ISIS remote-LFA configuration.

* CSCuf09006

Symptoms: Upon doing a clear ip bgp \* soft out or graceful shutdown on a PE, all VPNv4/v6 routes on an RR from this PE are purged at the expiry of enhanced refresh stale-path timer.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. 1. PE must have BGP peering with at least one CE (VRF neighbor) and at least one RR (VPN neighbor).

 2. PE must have a rtfilter unicast BGP peering with the RR.

 3. IOS version must have “Enhanced Refresh” feature enabled.

 4. A clear ip bgp \* soft out or graceful shutdown is executed on the PE.

Workaround: Instead of doing clear ip bgp \* soft out, do a route refresh individually towards all neighbors.

* CSCuf09198

Symptom: After deleting a VRF, you are unable to reconfigure the VRF.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when BGP SAFI 129 address-family is not configured, but unicast routes are installed into multicast RIB to serve as upstream multicast hop, as described in RFC 6513. This applies to VRFs configured before BGP is configured.

Workaround: Beyond unconfiguring BGP, there is no workaround once the issue occurs. Configuring a dummy VRF multicast address-family under BGP before the issue occurs can prevent the problem from occurring.

* CSCuf30798

Symptom: SIP 600 crashes.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with VPLS VC going over GRE tunnel and chassis having both ES+ and SIP 600 card.

Workaround: Remove VPLS over GRE. This configuration is not supported.

* CSCuf56776

Symptom: After a linecard is removed and reinserted (OIR), traffic may fail to pass through some virtual circuits which have been configured for pseudowire redundancy.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the first segment ID in the redundancy group is numerically greater than the second segment.

PE1#show ssm id | inc 1st 1stMem: 16394 2ndMem: 12301 ActMem: 12301 1stMem: 16394 2ndMem: 12301 ActMem: 12301

After the OIR is performed, it can be seen that the segments are reversed on the linecard.

ESM-20G-12#sh ssm id | inc 1st 1stMem: 12301 2ndMem: 16394 ActMem: 12301 1stMem: 12301 2ndMem: 16394 ActMem: 12301

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf60830

Symptom: Standby-RP occasionally crashes on process SSS Manager after an RP failover when the new Standby-RP attempts to sync.

Conditions: This symptom occurs during an RP Failover, at high scale, with a high churn of sessions and ISG services.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf61640

Symptom: Tracebacks as follows seen during router bootup:

%SYS-2-INTSCHED: ’suspend’ at level 2 -Process= "Init", ipl= 2, pid= 3

-Traceback= 4F6966C 6A708EC 890127C 6B4F924 6B4F7F8 6B4EAAC 6B4F43C 6B4F514 6DD6D4C 6DDB3A8 6A23E50 6A23F18 6A24100 57D3F94 57D42D8 4F701E4

Conditions: The symptom is observed during router bootup.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf62756

Symptom: If bandwidth qos-reference value is configured on an interface which bandwidth can change, then the actual interface bandwidth will be used for QoS service-policy validation when the interface bandwidth changes. This can result in a service-policy being removed if the interface bandwidth is insufficient to meet the requirements of the service-policy, such as bandwidth guarantees.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in variable-bandwidth interfaces such as EFM interfaces or PPP multilink bundles.

Workaround:

 1. Use proportional actions in the QoS service-policy, such as “police rate percent....”, “bandwidth remaining ratio...”, “bandwidth remaining percent...”, and “priority percent”

 2. You can configure bandwidth qos-reference with maximum bandwidth of the interface:

 **interface Ethernet0 bandwidth qos-reference**  *<max bandwidth of interface>*

This can prevent policy-map detached due to interface bandwidth change.

* CSCuf64313

Symptoms: Linecard crash is seen with machine-check exception.

Conditions: There is no trigger. The crash is random.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf65371

Symptom: On LAC, with “l2tp hidden” configured under VPDN template, L2TP sessions are failing to establish on existing L2TP tunnels after RP failover.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with “l2tp hidden” configured under VPDN template.

Workaround: Tear down L2TP tunnels after RP failover, or unconfigure “l2tp hidden”. Disabling L2TP redundancy with “no l2tp sso enable” will fix issue as well.

* CSCuf68995

Symptom: Ping failures. Traffic gets dropped.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you configure MPLSoMGRE tunnel on PE1 and PE2. Initiate ping from CE1 to CE2. Packets reach the CE2 and replay is coming back but these packets are getting dropped on PE2. After PE2 switchover, ping fails from CE1 to CE2. PE2 is configured with MPLSoMGRE on an HA system. Topology:

CE1---- PE1 ----PE2----CE2

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf81275

Symptom: Some ISG sessions do not pass traffic.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you have more than one Line Card for the ISG sessions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf82179

Symptom: BGP routes remain installed in multicast RIB even after “address-family” configuration has been removed from “vrf definition”.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in MVPN topology, where the stale routes are installed as an upstream multicast hop, as described in RFC:  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6513>

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf93376

Symptom: CUBE reloads while testing SDP passthrough with v6.

Conditions: The symptom is observed while testing SDP passthrough with v6.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf93606

Symptoms: A Cisco 3945E router crashes.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Extension mobility is configured for the phone. The logout profile should not be configured with any number.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) In the logged out state, user has to press the “NewCall” softkey followed by dialing any digit between 1-9 (excluding 0).

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Instead of pressing “dial” softkey, press “AbbrDial” softkey.

Workaround: Have a proper number configured under the logout profile.

* CSCug04187

Symptom: Build breakage.

Conditions: This symptom occurs due to CSCuf62756.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug08561

Symptom: After a web-logon, users do not get the web-logon response page sent by the portal. If the web-logon is successful, users are not redirected to the web address which they have entered initially but are redirected to the portal for authentication.

Conditions: This symptom occurs under the following conditions:

 1. Walkby feature is enabled with L4R & PBHK features applied to the lite session.

 2. User initiated the web-logon request.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

More Info: When a user does a web-logon, an account-logon coa request is triggered from the portal to ISG. In ISG, the account-logon request triggers a lite session conversion to a dedicated session. During the conversion, lite session and its associated resources (L4R and PBHK mappings) are removed from PD and a dedicated session gets provisioned. Once the conversion is done, ISG replies back with COA ACK/NACK to the portal. Based on the response from ISG, the portal generates a weblogon response (SUCCESS/FAILURE) page and sends it back to the client. But when it reaches ISG, the response packet does not get classified to session in the downstream direction and gets dropped in ISG because PBHK & L4R maping are deleted.

* CSCug10922

Symptom: A traceback is seen in the standby RP after a headend SSO.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when SSO tracebacks are seen.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug15952

Symptom: %QOS-3-INDEX\_EXISTS error message is shown and router crashes.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when sessions are bought up and the collision IDs with dynamic policy names are synced to standby from active. When the sessions time out and restart, the same dynamic policy names are synced to HA tree on standby again without cleaning up the tree earlier and the crash will happen.

Workaround: Avoid the same session reestablishment before rebooting the router.

* CSCug17724

Symptom: When using session protection and graceful restart for LDP, LDP neighbor goes down immediately after filtering LDP hello between routers. The LDP neighbor should go down after 10 minutes (default value of forwarding state holding time for GR).

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you enable session protection and graceful restart for LDP

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug17808

Symptom: Redistributed default route not advertised to EIGRP peer.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when Cisco ASR router is rebooted or the route is cleared via the clear ip route command, the route disappears form the spokes.

Workaround: Clearing the EIGRP Neighborship restores the route on the spokes.

* CSCug18797

Symptom: Router crashes when it checks whether the interface is configured as DHCP SIP session initiator.

Conditions: The symptom is observed DHCP and ISG are configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug20048

Symptom: MPLS traffic engineering BC MAM model does not take effect when configured.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you configure the BC MAM model.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug20705

Symptom: A 7600-SIP-400 LC crash is seen with an SPA reload.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after an SPA reload with FRF12 and service policy on the interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug23348

Symptom: The “mod” value in the SSRAM may be inconsistent to the number of ECMP paths.

Conditions: This occurs with ECMP TE tunnels with tunnel mpls traffic-eng load-share value commands configured.

Workaround: Remove the tunnel mpls traffic-eng load-share value commands from the TE tunnels.

* CSCug24114

Symptom: CTS environment-data download fails from ISE.

Conditions: The symptom is observed if there is less PAC and environment-data refresh timer is configured in ISE. After multiple refreshes of PAC and environment data and the switch is reloaded, sometimes a CTS environment-data download fails from ISE on the switch.

Workaround: Unconfigure pac key CLI and configure it again as below:

no pac key pac key <key-id>

* CSCug25258

Symptom: Router crashes while running the show interface rate-limit command. When entries down the list of the output disappear for reasons such as interfaces going down or PPPoE clients disconnecting, the router may crash when you hit the space bar to get to these invalid entries.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when rate limiting is configured.

Workaround: Configure  **term length 0** before running the show output.

* CSCug28904

Symptoms: Router drops ESP packets with CRYPTO-4-RECVD\_PKT\_MAC\_ERR.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the peer router sends nonce with length 256 bytes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug31561

A vulnerability in the DHCP implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of crafted DHCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DHCP packets to an affected device that has the DHCP server or DHCP relay feature enabled. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds to this vulnerability.

This advisory is available at the following link:

* CSCug33084

Symptom: SP/DFC crash is seen when churn on multicast is done, either through provisioning/unprovisioning or other network event.

Conditions: The issue occurs when a pointer to an already freed hal\_context is still present in a replicate queue. Later during churn the same pointer is accessed which leads to the crash.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug34404

Symptom: RP crash seen at be\_interface\_action\_remove\_old\_sadb.

Conditions: The symptom is observed while unconfiguring the 4K SVTI sessions after an HA test.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug34503

Symptom: LLDP packets with destination MAC: 01:80:C2:00:00:0E are dropped.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with the fix of CSCue41216.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

More Info: Regression because of CSCue41216 causes LLDP packets which have a MAC address of 01.80.c2.00.00.0e to get dropped according to MEF standard. But the packets should get dropped for SUNI and NNI port, while for CUNI they should get passed.

* CSCug34507

Symptom: Traffic decrypted on a Cisco ISR G2 series is process switched instead of staying in the CEF path.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the hub and/or the spoke are located behind NAT or PAT.

Workaround: Disable NAT/PAT.

* CSCug34877

Symptom: A switch crashes with following message:

%SYS-2-LINKED: Bad enqueue of 901E0D40 in queue 1AABE690 -Process= "SSH Process", ipl= 0, pid= 392

Conditions: This symptom occurs while making an SSH connection to a remote device from the switch while having multiple SSH connections to the same switch

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug37242

Symptoms: Router crash due to memory leak.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a CME shared line feature configuration.

Workaround: Disabling shared line feature will avoid memory leak.

* CSCug38011

Symptom: Device crashes with CPU hog messages.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the device is reloaded after configuring NTP peer:

ntp server pool.ntp.org source cell0

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug39278

Symptom: L3 QoS policy not working in EVC L3 VPN.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when CFM is enabled globally.

Workaround: Disable CFM.

* CSCug44667

Symptom: SG3 fax call failures observed for STCAPP audio calls.

Conditions: Fax CM tone detection is turned ON even when all fax and modem related configurations have been disabled on the STCAPP gateway.

Workaround: STCAPP modem pass-through feature can be enabled, but you may run into issues with some answering SG3 fax machines which have stringent requirements for fax CM signal.

* CSCug50208

Symptom: A crash is seen due to double free of memory.

Conditions: The symptom is seen when the accept interface VLAN goes down.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug50340

Symptom: PW traffic is not flowing after SSO/card reset the active PTF card.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. Create a unprotected tunnel between the active PTF card and create a PW.

 2. Apply the table map. Bi-directional traffic is flowing fine.

 3. SSO/reset the active PTF card in node 106 (4/1).

 4. Now tunnel core port is in standby card.

 5. Observed bi-directional traffic is not flowing once the card becomes up.

 6. Again reset the active PTF card (5/4).

 7. Observe uni-directional traffic only is flowing.

Workaround: Delete the PW and recreate it again. However, note that if you do an SSO/card reset, the issue reappears.

* CSCug52119

Symptom: A RIB route is present for a prefix, but the router continues to LISP encapsulate.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when a LISP map-cache existed for a prefix and then the RIB route was added later.

Workaround: Use the following command:

clear ip/ipv6 lisp map-cache <prefix>

* CSCug58617

Symptom: Usernames do not show up in CCP Express. Username shows up on a router with default configuration.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on routers with configurations that break show runn | format.

Workaround: Use default configuration.

* CSCug58977

Symptom: 2.6Gbp/s traffic is observed on both of the VPN SPA interfaces. Traffic direction: Rx on outside interface, Tx on inside interface.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when fragmented IPSec packet arrives on clear side. The issue is observed only in VRF mode.

Workaround: Reload the IPSec card.

* CSCug59746

Symptom: A crash is seen on the RP in the SS manager process:

Exception to IOS Thread: Frame pointer 0x7F58BB22FE80, PC = 0x7C505FB

UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = SSS Manager -Traceback= 1#980611ad3b9665cd80fe5178bcd6036a :400000+78505FB :400000+7C68774 :400000+7C6871A :400000+1C13522 :400000+7852194 :400000+78512C8 :400000+7C68774 :400000+7C6871A :400000+33A8AC1 :400000+77DD92F :400000+33C3E4C :400000+33AFE89 :400000+33B2564 :400000+7824301 :400000+7823F37 :400000+77FA27F

Conditions: The issue appears to be related to NAS port. It looks like a key is being set when the issue occurred. The exact conditions are still being investigated.

Workaround: Possibly remove radius or more specifically, NAS port configurations. This still needs to be verified.

* CSCug61485

Symptom: The Cisco ASR 1000 RP crashes in RSVP.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when “mpls traffic-eng tunnels” is configured on an interface and “ip rsvp bandwidth” is not configured and the bandwidth on the physical interface is changed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug62154

Symptom: CPU shoots to 100% with TACACS configuration. VTY to the device does not work due to this.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the router or switch is booted up with TACACS configurations and the CPU shoots up to 100%. Telnet to the router is not possible. Any command issued on the console would take lot of time.

Workaround: Remove the TACACS configurations and then reboot the router.

* CSCug63013

Symptom: A DMVPN spoke router running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M3 and configured with “if-state nhrp” might not re-form eigrp neighbourship if the line protocol on the interface goes down and comes back automatically.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in a DMVPN spoke router running 15.2(4)M3 with “if-state nhrp" configured and interface line protocol going down. It must also be using the new multicast code (15.1(4)M onwards).

Workaround:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Removing “ip nhrp map multicast x.x.x.x y.y.y.y” and readding it resolves the problem.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Shut/no shut on the tunnel interface

* CSCug63839

Symptom: The Cisco 7301 router running c7301-advipservicesk9-mz.152-4.M3 experiences a memory leak in the Crypto IKMP process particularly on the crypto\_ikmp\_config\_send\_ack\_addr function.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when running the Cisco 7301 router and connecting EasyVPN through it.

Workaround: Reload the router over a period of time.

* CSCug68193

Symptom: Multicast traffic across ES+ cards stop flowing across subinterfaces.

Conditions: The symptom is observed after a linecard OIR. After the linecard comes up, multicast traffic stops flowing across subinterfaces.

Workaround: Shut/no shut the subinterface.

* CSCug69253

Symptom: Users will see the following error message on unconfiguring a port-map of a protocol:

% NBAR Error: Specified port(s) are associated with <protocol-name>

Conditions: This symptom occurs when users have port-mapped a protocol on which other protocols are dependant, and this port-map configuration includes the well-known port as well. On unconfiguring this port-map configuration, the error message will be shown.

For example, a lot of protocols are dependant on http (share-point, youtube, skype, etc.) because they run over http. If the user port-maps http and includes its well-known port (80) in the configuration, then the following error message will be shown during unconfiguration:

Router(config)#no ip nbar port-map http tcp 80 94 8080 3128 8092

% NBAR Error: Specified port(s) are associated with share-point

Workaround: Users will not be able to remove this port-map configuration. To revert back, reconfigure http to its original configuration (tcp 80), save the configuration, and reload the router

The following is the CLI to reconfigure http to its well-known configuration:

Router(config)#ip nbar port-map http tcp 80

* CSCug72891

Symptom: EIGRP neighbor flaps due to EIGRP SIA. Troubleshooting shows that a race condition causes EIGRP successor loop first and it leads to EIGRP QUERY loop resulting in the neighbor flaps.

Conditions: The issue is observed when a worse metric update is received from the successor, once the route is already in active state, in a partially peered multiaccess network.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug78098

Symptom: Supervisor engine crashes and the Cisco IOS software is forced to reload due to PIM process.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when using the command, show ip pim rp-hash right after the BSR RP times out, causes the crash.

Workaround: Perform these steps in the following order:

 1. Wait for a minute after BSR RP times out before using this command.

 2. Configuring no ip domain lookup will make the time taken to execute show ip pim rp-hash to a few milliseconds. This will prevent the crash from being reproduced manually.

* CSCug78929

Symptom: Packets of a certain protocol are dropped due to v6 PACL applied on a switch port.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when v6 PACL contains explicit protocol entries such as “permit 89 any any”.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug85947

Symptom: OSPFv3 routes go missing after an NSR switchover.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after an SSO.

Workaround: Clear the IPv6 OSPF process.

* CSCug94275

Symptom: ES+ card crashes with an unexpected exception to CPU: vector 200, PC = 0x0.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on the ES+ series linecards on a Cisco 7600 series router. Symptom is reported on the ES+ console and in the crashinfo file on the ES+ flash disk. It is not reported in the syslog.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh07349

Symptom: A Cisco 7600 Sup may crash due to SP memory corruption.

Conditions: This issue is observed on an REP enabled router, which is part of an REP segment. The exact trigger for this issue is not clear.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh07657

Symptom: VRF Aggregate label is not re-originated after a directly connected CE facing interface (in VRF) is shut down.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in an MPLS VPN set-up with Cisco 7600(PE) Router running on Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE4 with per VRF aggregation.

For example:

mpls label mode vrf TEST protocol all-afs per-vrf

Workaround: Downgrade to Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE3 or earlier.

* CSCuh16115

Symptom: With VPLS configuration with IP-FRR, on doing multiple churns SP/LC may crash.

Conditions: The issue occurs when xconnect internal data structre is to be freed up and IP FRR is still pointing to it.

Workaround: Remove IP-FRR configuration before unprovisioning xconnect.

* CSCuh16927

Symptom: Mac entries learned on a trunk link are flushed after removing VLANs.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when some allowed VLANs are removed on a trunk link, all mac address entries learned on this link are flushed. This is issue is specific to extended VLAN IDs.

Workaround: Executing ping to destination IP after removing VLANs will recover this condition.

* CSCuh21740

Symptom: There is a deletion and addition of VRFs with MVPNV6 configurations.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when PIM VRF neighbors are not up.

Workaround: Reload the router.

* CSCuh24040

Symptom: BGP routes are not marked Stale and considered best routes even though the BGP session with the peer is torn down. A hard or soft reset of the BGP peering session does not help.

For BFD-related triggering, the following messages are normally produced with the BGP-5-ADJCHANGE message first, and the BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE message second. Under normal conditions, the two messages will have identical timestamps. When this problem is seen, the order of the messages will be reversed, with the BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE message appearing first, and with a slightly different timestamp from the BGP-5-ADJCHANGE message. In the problem case, the BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE message will also include the string “NSF peer closed the session”

For example when encountering this bug, you would see:

May 29 18:16:24.414: %BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor x.x.x.x IPv4 Unicast vpn vrf VRFNAME topology base removed from session NSF peer closed the session May 29 18:16:24.526: %BGP-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor x.x.x.x vpn vrf VRFNAME Down BFD adjacency down

Instead of:

May 29 18:16:24.354: %BGP-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor x.x.x.x vpn vrf VRFNAME Down BFD adjacency down May 29 18:16:24.354: %BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor x.x.x.x IPv4 Unicast vpn vrf VRFNAME topology base removed from session BFD adjacency down

Log messages associated for non-BFD triggers are not documented.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when BGP graceful restart is used in conjunction with BFD, but it is possible (but very low probability) for it to happen when BGP graceful restart processing happens when any other type of BGP reset (eg: clear command) is in progress.

Affected configurations all include: router bgp ASN... bgp graceful-restart...

The trigger is that BGP exceeds its CPU quantum during the processing of a reset, and gives up the CPU, and then BGP Graceful Restart processing runs before BGP can complete its reset processing. This is a very low probability event, and triggering it is going to be highly dependent on the configuration of the router, and on BGP’s CPU requirements.

It is not possible to trigger this bug unless BGP graceful-restart is configured.

Workaround: If you are engaged in active monitoring of router logs, and the bug is being triggered by a BFD-induced reset, you can detect this situation by watching for the reversal of log message order described in the Symptoms section, and then take manual steps to remedy this problem when it occurs.

On the problematic router, issue no neighbor <xxx> activate command under the proper address-family will clear the stale routes.

The other option is to manually shutdown the outgoing interface which marks the routes as “inaccessible” and hence not been used anymore. This prevents the traffic blackhole but the routes will stay in the BGP table.

More Info: This bug affects all releases where CSCsk79641 or CSCtn58128 is integrated. Releases where neither of those fixes is integrated are not affected.

* CSCuh27770

Symptom: On a dual-RP system which is configured for stateful switchover (SSO), some VPLS virtual circuits may fail to be provisioned on the standby route processor.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the VFI consists of VLAN interfaces that are also configured for IP.

Workaround: Reload the standby RP.

* CSCuh29716

Symptom: When a call is transferred from IVR to PSTN, the codec negotiation with Verizon fails only if the original invite received includes fax capabilities, dropping the call with reason code 47 and hanging the UDP port used.

Call flow:

Verizon -- CUBE -- CUSP -- Genesys/IVR, transferred with SIP Refer back to PSTN hair-pinning the call on CUBE.

All subsequent calls that try to re-use the same UDP port for RTP stream are dropped with reason code 47 and provisn RSP fail is logged on show voip fpi stats.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in hair-pinned calls that receive FAX capabilities on the original SIP invite from Verizon.

Workaround: There is no workaround. Reload the router to clear UDP ports.

* CSCuh32177

Symptom: The  **no passive-interface**   *<if-name>* command will be added automatically after configuring the  **ipv6 enable** command on the interface even though the  **passive-interface default**  command is configured for OSPFv3.

--- (config)#interface FastEthernet0/2/0 (config-if)#ipv6 enable (config-if)#end

#sh run | sec ipv6 router ospf ipv6 router ospf 100 router-id 10.1.1.1 passive-interface default no passive-interface FastEthernet0/2/0 <<< Added automatically. ---

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the  **passive-interface default** command is configured for OSPFv3.

Workaround: Adjust the configuration manually. In this example it would be “passive-interface FastEthernet0/2/0”.

* CSCuh40275

Symptom: SNMP occupies more than 90% of the CPU.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when polling the cefFESelectionTable MIB.

Workaround:Execute the following commands:

snmp-server view cutdown iso included

snmp-server view cutdown cefFESelectionEntry excluded

snmp-server community public view cutdown ro

snmp-server community private view cutdown rw

* CSCuh40329

Symptom: OSPFV3 runs as PE-CE, but used to learn IPv4 prefixes. Core facing interface is GRE tunnel where OSPF and LDP runs. OSPV3 based Shamlinks are created between PEs. When tunnel flaps, OSPF and LDP recovers, but in a few seconds tunnel locks up. In locked up condition, all traffic fails on the tunnel, even directly connected pings. The only way to recover is to reconfigure the tunnel from scratch. It happens fairly consistently after every re-convergence, not every time though.

Conditions: This symptom is seen only on ISRG2s that are configured as PEs. They are so far seen with 3925 running Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2)T and 2911 running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M3.

Workaround: Use OSPF V2 based shamlinks.

* CSCuh40617

Symptom: Ping fails when “encap dot1q” is configured on an FE SPA inserted in bay 1 of flexwan.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when FE SPA is inserted in bay 1 of flexwan.

Workaround: Move the SPA to bay 0 of flexwan.

* CSCuh43027

Symptom: Prefixes withdrawn from BGP are not removed from the RIB, although they are removed from the BGP table.

Conditions: A withdraw message contains more than one NLRI, one of which is for a route that is not chosen as best. If deterministic med is enabled, then the other NLRI in the withdraw message might not eventually be removed from the RIB.

Workaround: Forcibly clear the RIB.

* CSCuh43252

Symptom: After upgrading to Cisco IOS Release 15.0(2)SE3, you can no longer authenticate using TACACS. The TPLUS process on the switch will be pushing the CPU up to 99%.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you use TACACS for authentication.

Workaround: Downgrade the switch to a version prior to Cisco IOS Release 15.0(2)SE3.

* CSCuh43255

Symptom: The BGP task update-generation process may cause the router to reload, in a rare timing condition when there is prefix flap and there is high scale of prefixes going through update-generation, including the flapping prefix.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the Cisco ASR router is acting as a route server for BGP along with having various route-server contexts. The router does not do any forwarding. It merely processes control plane traffic.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

More Info: The setup is the same as mentioned in this doc:  [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/iproute\_bgp/configuration/guide/irg\_route\_server\_xe.html](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/iproute_bgp/configuration/guide/irg_route_server_xe.html.).

* CSCuh46031

Symptom: The Cisco ASR 1000 router sends a different Acct-Session-Id in the Access-Request and Accounting-Request for the same user.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when Flex VPN IPsec remote access is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh46849

Symptom: A Cisco ASR 1000 router may display the following log with a traceback:

SCHED-3-UNEXPECTEDEVENT Process received unknown event (maj 80, min 0).

Conditions: The conditions are unknown.

Workaround: Reload the router.

* CSCuh48840

Symptom: Cisco Router crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) sup-bootdisk formatted and copied with big size file, like copy 7600 image file around 180M size

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) reload box, and during bootup try to write file to sup-bootdisk (SEA write sea\_log.dat 32M bytes)

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) then the issue appear

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When the issue seen, check the sea\_log.dat always with 0 byte

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) No matter where (disk0 or bootdisk) to load image.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) No matter sea log disk to sup-bootdisk or disk0:. I reproduced the issue with “logg sys disk disk0:” config.

SEA is calling IFS API to create sea\_log.dat, looks like IFS creating file hungs SP.

sea\_log.c : sea\_log\_init\_file() -> ifs\_open() -> sea\_zero\_log() -> ifs\_lseek() -> ifs\_write()

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh53544

Symptom: OSPF ABR router does not flush type-4 ASBR summary LSA after NSR swithover if the connection to ASBR is lost during NSR switchover.

Conditions: This symptom is occurs when the VSS system acts as ABR and loses connection to an ASBR during NSR switchover. This configuration is not recommended and Layer 3 topology should not change during the switchover.

Workaround: Clear ip ospf proc.

* CSCuh56327

Symptom: IP SLA responder crash occurs on Cisco ASR 1002 router in Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S, Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1, and Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S2.

Conditions:This symptom occurs when ip sla udp jitter with precision microseconds, udp jitter with milliseconds and udp echo are configured on the sender device with the same destination port on Cisco ASR 1002 router.

Workaround:Use different destination ports for udp-echo and udp jitter with millisecond precision than udp jitter with microsecond and optimize timestamp.

* CSCuh62266

Symptom: During normal operation, the Cisco ASR 1000 router may crash after repeated SNMP related watchdog errors.

* CSCsr06399

Symptoms: A Cisco 5400XM may reload unexpectedly.

Conditions: This symptom is intermittent and is seen only when the DSPs available are insufficient to support the number of calls.

Workaround: Ensure that sufficient DSPs are available for transcoding.

* CSCtx50235

Symptoms: During a crash on the Cisco Catalyst 6500, the normal crash information from the crashinfo files may be missing due to the crashes showing the Routing processor (RP) being reset by the Switching Processor (SP) and the RP crashinfo also showing the RP being reset by the SP. This bug addresses this serviceability issue and it has nothing to do with the root cause of the crash itself.

In a majority of cases, the crash has been a single-event crash and has not repeated.

Conditions: Conditions of this symptom are not known currently. At this point, it is believed that the real fault of the crash belongs to the SP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty07538

Symptoms: TCP sessions get reset intermittently when NAT is configured with more than 1500 translations.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in the Cisco Catalyst 6500-Sup720/Sup32 when NAT is configured with more than 1500 translations.

Workaround 1: Remove NAT.

Workaround 2: Force packets coming to RP on the NAT interfaces to be process switched by configuring no ip route-cache on the NAT interfaces.

* CSCtz26779

Symptoms: A 7600 ES line card and/or SUP/RSP may crash displaying DATACORRUPTION-1-DATAINCONSISTENCY messages.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when a policy-map is configured where the name exceeds 80 characters. This will trigger DATACORRUPTION messages on ES line cards and might cause the SUP/RSP to crash as well.

Workaround: Configure policy-map names that are less then or equal to 80 characters.

* CSCtz53214

Symptoms: The “clear counter pseudowire <#>” commands do not clear the pseudowire specific counters.

Conditions: This symptom is reported to be present in all Cisco IOS Release 15.X(S) versions.

Workaround: Issuing global clear count (“clear counters”) will clear counters including pseudowire specific counters.

* CSCtz60398

Symptoms: Continuous “platform assert failure” trace backs with CFM over Xconnect on the box occurs.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with CFMoXconnect and MPLS TE in the core. Flap the core-facing link.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz97197

Symptoms: SIP SPAs go in the out of service state in a scaled subinterface configuration (more than 2000 subinterfaces on a single Gigabit Ethernet port).

Conditions: This symptom occurs while performing ISSU between the iso1-rp2 and iso2-rp2 Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6S throttle image. After ISSU runversion, the SIP SPAs go in the out of service state. This issue is seen in a heavily scaled configuration. The issue is observed when there are 2000 to 3000 subinterfaces on a single SPA and the following limits are exceeded:

Overall Dual stack VRFs per box: 2800 Dual stack limit on interface: 1000

Workaround: This issue is not seen in the following scenario:

 1. Before doing a load version from RP0(initial active), enter the following command:

asr1000# show ipv6 route table | inc IPv6

 2. Note down the number of IPv6 route tables in the system.

 3. Do a load version.

 4. Wait for standby to come up to Standby hot.

 5. Enable the standby console from RP0 (active).

asr1000#configure terminal

Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.

asr1000(config)#

asr1000(config)#redundancy

asr1000(config-red)#main-cpu

asr1000(config-r-mc)#standby console enable

 6. Log in to the standby console and enter the following command:

asr1000-stby# show ipv6 route table | inc IPv6

 7. Then, note down the number of IPv6 route tables in standby. If the number is lesser than the number noted in step 2, wait for some time and reverify till it reaches the number noted in step 2.

 8. Issue ISSU runversion from RPO(active).

* CSCua43781

Symptoms: WCCP redirection does not work. The mls netflow table does not get installed in the Cisco Catalyst 6500 switches for packets to get redirected to the WAAS hardware.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the current configuration, MASK/GRE/GRE, is changed to HASH/L2/L2.

Workaround: Perform shut/no shut once or twice on the interface connected to the WAE hardware.

* CSCub10950

* CSCub28997

Symptoms: Overlord crashes with 2000 crypto sessions (4000 IPSec SAs) upon repeatedly clearing and reestablishing the SAs.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the box is configured with 1K VRFs and 1K Virtual templates, and the crypto sessions are repeatedly cleared or reestablished.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub45763

Symptoms: The device crashes due to SYS-2-FREEFREE and SYS-6-MTRACE messages while a CDP frame is being processed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when CDP is in use.

Workaround: Disable CDP using the  **no cdp run** command.

Note: If the device in question relies on or supports a phone or voice network, this is not a valid workaround.

* CSCub56064

Symptoms: Ping fails after doing EZVPN client connect if CEF is enabled.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the Cisco IOS Release 15.3(0.8)T image. This issue is seen only for a specific topology, where the in/out interface is the same.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub56842

Symptoms: The router stops passing IPsec traffic after some time.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the show crypto eli command output shows that during every IPsec P2 rekey, the active IPsec-Session count increases, which does not correlate to the max IPsec counters displayed in SW.

Workaround: Reload the router before active sessions reach the max value.

To verify, do as follows:

router#sh cry eli

CryptoEngine Onboard VPN details: state = Active

Capability: IPPCP, DES, 3DES, AES, GCM, GMAC, IPv6, GDOI, FAILCLOSE, HA

IPSec-Session: 7855 active, 8000 max, 0 failed <<<

* CSCub58119

Symptoms: VRF-aware GRE tunnel traffic drops while performing SSO(VRF-GRE tunnel adjacency is wrong after performing SSO).

Conditions: This symptom occurs because of incorrect programming of the adjacency interface.The adjacency information on the standby is incorrect as it does not get synced from “active”. Configure VRF-aware GRE tunnels and send traffic to all the tunnels. Perform SSO and traffic drops on all the tunnels.

Workaround: Reload the router or perform shut/no shut on the tunnels.

* CSCub60422

Symptoms: The ME-3600X-24CX-M box crashes on executing the  **diagnostic start test all**  command.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on executing the  **diagnostic start test all** command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub72198

Symptoms: Executed CLI fails to sync to standby and results in standby reload.

Conditions: This occurs when the following conditions are met:

 1. Active and standby are running different version of IOS image.

 2. The CLI being applied is not PRC compliant, meaning that this CLI does not return a valid parser return code.

Workaround: Avoid applying CLIs that are not PRC compliant during image upgrade or downgrade.

* CSCub85416

Symptoms: The router crashes after the ISSU RUN VERSION in the latest mcp\_dev image with G8302 configurations.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with 11k EoMPLS VC and G8302 configurations.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub93442

Symptoms: FlexVPN client does not get assigned with IPv6 address when IPv6 address is assigned using radius attribute “addrv6”.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on assigning IPv6 using the radius attribute “addrv6”.

Workaround: Assign IPv6 address statically or use radius IPv6 pool attribute “ipv6-addr-pool”.

Further Problem Description:

 1. Radius Server is used for assigning IPv6 address to the FlexVPN clients.

 2. Using radius attribute “ipv6-addr-pool” for assigning IPv6 address from a Ipv6 pool defined works fine.

 3. If Radius attribute “addrv6” is used to assign IPv6 address then the IPv6 address assignment fails and client sends notification with internal address failure.

* CSCuc05929

Symptoms: After a reload, sometimes the MPLS forwarding function on some interfaces is not enabled. Some interfaces that were configured with “mpls ip” and link-state-up do not show with the  **show mpls interface** command. This issue depends on a timing of the interface up.

Conditions: Sometimes the issue occurs after a router reload or SIP/SPA reload. It is not affected when you configure “mpls ip” on an interface, admin-shutdown/no shutdown, and link-flap.

Workaround: There is no workaround. When the issue occurs, do an admin-shutdown/no shutdown on the affected interface or disable/re-enble MPLS on the interface.

* CSCuc21610

Symptoms: The console displays a message indicating that offloading is not supported for the BFD echo mode.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a BFD session is configured in the echo mode.

Workaround: There is no workaround. The issue has no functionality impact.

* CSCuc23542

Symptoms: The PXE client network boot fails when an ME3600-running 152-4.S is the DHCP relay agent.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the ME3600 changes the option 54 “DHCP Server Identifier” address to its own IP address in the DHCP Offer received from the PXE DHCP server. This causes the client to send the PXE boot request (port 4011) to the ME3600 instead of the PXE server.

Workaround: Downgrade ME3600 to Cisco IOS Release 15.1(2)EY.

* CSCuc31761

Symptoms: The router crashes when GDOI groups are removed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the “crypto isakmp diagnose error <no>” CLI is enabled. This CLI is now enabled by default.

Workaround: Remove or disable the  **crypto isakmp diagnose error** command.

* CSCuc43719

Symptoms: The Cisco ASR 903 router with dual RSP may crash.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with configurations related to NBAR. There is no specific trigger for this symptom.

Workaround: Do not have any NBAR configurations on the box as these are not supported on the Cisco ASR 903 router.

* CSCuc54300

Symptoms: During an SSO or an initial bootup, standby fails and reboots again.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a reload or SSO is performed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc54604

Symptoms: CUBE SP does not respond to any SIP messages sent across using TCP. Call Flow:

Multiple CUCM’s ---> SIP --->CUBE SP--->Provider

Conditions: This symptom occurs in the Cisco IOS Release 15.2(01)S01 and is only active when there are calls running SIP TCP. During create/close transaction on TCP, the control buffer will be on hold. So if closing of the existing TCP connection is needed while the control buffers are all being held, the connection will be marked as dead and will not be able to notify the corresponding peer. Therefore, the peer might still send data through that connection which CUBE-SP would think as invalid and get dropped internally.

Workaround: Send the SIP call as UDP instead of TCP.

* CSCuc59386

Symptoms: Continuous IOMD crashes occur on OC-3 IM. Interfaces on OC-3 IM are not configurable and the following error message is seen:

stand-by does not support this command

Conditions: This symptom is seen on an HA Cisco ASR 903 router setup with OC-3 IM. It is observed when an IOMD crash happens on an active RSP and the standby IOMD session handle is not cleared.

Workaround: Reload the standby RSP.

* CSCuc78328

Symptoms: SP crashes followed by an RP reset.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when multicast-enabled (PIM) tunnels are protected with IPSec.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc85319

Symptoms: RP crashes during the TFTP ATM interface configuration.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after flapping the ATM subinterface configured with the ATM bundle 8192 times.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc93082

Symptoms: A Bulk Sync failure occurs.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the standby is brought up from ROMmon and the  **service-policy** command is configured on the CEM circuit as active.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc96345

Symptoms: ARP exchange between the Cisco 7600 and the client device fails. The Cisco 7600 has an incomplete ARP entry in its ARP table for the client. This issue is likely to be seen between the Cisco 7600 and other Cisco platforms with MAC address 6073.5Cxx.xxxx. The incoming ARP reply is parsed by the platform CEF as an IP packet and dropped.

The following OUIs (as of October 30, 2012) are affected: (first 3 bytes from MAC address/MAC starts with)

14-73-73 20-73-55 4C-73-67 4C-73-A5 54-73-98 60-73-5C (One of Cisco’s OUI ranges) 64-73-E2 70-73-CB 8C-73-6E 98-73-C4 A0-73-32 C4-73-1E D0-73-8E F0-73-AE F4-73-CA

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the EVC pseudowire and 802.1q subinterface on the same physical interface, and connectivity via the subinterface is affected.

Sample configuration:

interface TenGigabitEthernet3/1 service instance 2013 ethernet encapsulation dot1q 411 second-dot1q 200 rewrite ingress tag pop 2 symmetric xconnect 10.254.10.10 3350075 encapsulation mpls interface TenGigabitEthernet3/1.906 encapsulation dot1Q 906 ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0

Workaround: - There should be a static ARP entry on the Cisco 7600 for the client’s MAC and IP. - Change the MAC address of client to a nonaffected OUI.

NOTE: This DDTS is caused or exposed due to fix of CSCtc22745.

* CSCuc96631

Symptoms: Incoming calls through e1 r2 stop working in Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M1.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with incoming calls through e1 r2 in Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M1. Outgoing calls work fine.

Workaround: Use Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)T.

* CSCud01502

Symptoms: A crash occurs in CME while accessing a stream in sipSPIDtmfRelaySipNotifyConfigd.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in CME.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud03250

Symptoms: Large TCP data transfers take longer than expected (about a 40% increase in time). In particular, initial BGP convergence for a full internet routing table after reload is known to increase by several minutes. Performance degradation was seen starting the XE37 throttle build 09/18 (BLD\_V152\_4\_S\_XE37\_THROTTLE\_LATEST\_20120918\_070025).

A comparison of sniffer traces of affected and unaffected traffic will show that in impacted versions of Cisco IOS, TCP more frequently probes the path MTU, and that when the larger packets are dropped, it treats these drops as indicating the presence of network congestion, and slows down the rate of data transmission.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the user tries with the BLD\_V152\_4\_S\_XE37\_THROTTLE\_LATEST\_20120917\_070015 label and the performance number is still good, but the BLD\_V152\_4\_S\_XE37\_THROTTLE\_LATEST\_20120918\_070025 label image shows much higher performance numbers in the order of 400 seconds. This issue is seen when the user also tries with the BLD\_V152\_4\_S\_XE37\_THROTTLE\_LATEST\_20120917\_070015 label.

Workaround: The underlying problem is caused by changes in the TCP path MTU discovery algorithm. Disable TCP path MTU discovery for affected BGP neighbors. Depending on the release, this is done by configuring the following:

neighbor x.x.x.x transport path-mtu-discovery disable or no neighbor x.x.x.x transport path-mtu-discovery

Note that the use of this workaround may have other negative performance consequences caused by packet fragmentation, and there may be a need to tune interface MSS.

* CSCud05368

Symptoms: Traffic will be redirected to the WCCP client even when it is denied in the WCCP redirect ACL.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with WCCP on the Cisco ASR 1000 router, when there are port(s) defined in service definition, for example, 80 for web-cache, while different port(s) defined in permit entries of redirect-ACL.

For example: permit tcp any eq 81

Workaround 1: Move the deny entries before the permits when possible (especially for deny... host...). But it still may not work in some situations.

Workaround 2: Use different redirect ACLs for each service, and remove the unnecessary ones for specific services (that is, the permit entries with ports not matching service definition).

* CSCud07642

Symptoms: AAL0 encapsulation fails.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when “control” is disabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud09870

Symptoms: The device crashes when you enable ?debug cmd-cfm? over xconnect with PC.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you configure the CFM over xconnect with PC downmep. After enabling the  **debug** command, the device crashes.

debug ethernet cfm pm session db 0.

Workaround: Issue the undebug all command.

* CSCud11627

Symptoms: SUP720 supervisor module may hang in ROMMON after the module reset triggered by TM\_DATA\_PARITY\_ERROR.

Conditions: The issue is observed after a module reset triggered by TM\_DATA\_PARITY\_ERROR.

Workaround: Power off or power on the router.

* CSCud19149

Symptom: Traffic drops for a few VPLS VCs with ECMP links.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when one of the ECMP paths is shut and when more than 200 VPLS VCs are configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud22038

Symptoms: When a PC is moved between two VLAN ports (on one port, ISG is enabled and the other port is non-ISG) several times by its LAN cable connection on the L2SW that is connected to the Cisco ASR 1000 router, the PC is unable to receive DHCP OFFER due to the wrong VLAN ID from the DHCP server on the Cisco ASR 1000 router.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud24601

Symptoms: After performing an SSO on a Quad-SUP setup, the previous standby displays the following error message on the console:

\*Nov 16 15:50:28.455: SW1-7\_STBY: ics\_cs\_nego\_open\_active\_port: ERROR: (no such port): Failed to locate active port \*Nov 16 15:50:29.591: SW1-7\_STBY: Bring up standby supervisor as a DFC \*Nov 16 15:50:32.331: %PFREDUN-SW1-7\_STBY-6-STANDBY: Initializing for SSO mode in In-chassis Domain

Conditions: This symptom occurs occasionally after performing an SSO on a Quad- SUP setup. This error message is harmless. The system will still reach SSO successfully.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud28541

Symptoms: SP crashes on doing no mpls ip followed by shut on port-channel acting as core link for scaled VPLS and EoMPLS setup.

Conditions: In case of VPLS going over port-channel protected by IP-FRR, when the port-channel is shut the AToM VC is going down and getting created again. Also the PPO object is getting created afresh. The VC going down is not handled for VPLS case and AToM VC’s pointer are still stored in IP-FRR’s EoMPLS list which is getting access and hence crashing.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud30806

Symptoms: Policy with class map match-all with prec 1 and prec 2 is accepted for WRED.

Conditions: Conditions to this symptom are not known currently.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Further Problem Description: match-all should not accept two prec values.

class-map match-all prec1\_2 match precedence 1 match precedence 2

* CSCud41058

Symptoms: There is a route-map which matches tags and set a new value. This route-map is used in an EIGRP outbound distribute list. One in 10 times based on the received route tag, the correct route tag value is not set while advertising out.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you use a route map which matches tags and sets a new tag. Used in distribute-list route-map name out.

Workaround: Clear the EIGRP process or readvertise the route.

* CSCud46309

Symptoms: When an SSO is configured and a GR full mode is not configured, TE tunnels may stay down after a switchover.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When SSO is configured.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When GR full mode not configured.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When a switchover is performed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud51791

Symptoms: Memory leak is seen on the router related to CCSIP\_SPI\_CONTRO.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in CME SIP phones with Presence in running-configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround. You may try to remove Presence from running-configuration.

* CSCud56281

Symptoms: There is a memory corruption issue while loading an NBAR protocol pack.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when an NBAR protocol pack is loaded onto the router using the ip nbar protocol-pack command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud63381

Symptoms: Switching from periodic to on-demand DPDs may cause the DPDs to fail intermittently and thus IPSEC Failover may not work correctly.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

 1. If you are using Cisco 7200-VSA.

 2. For Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M2.

 3. When on-demand DPDs are configured for IPSEC Failover.

Workaround: Disable the SCTP session:

ipc zone default association 1 shutdown

* CSCud64870

Symptom: DMVPN hub ASR1004 may crash after fetching the CRL from MS CRL server.

Conditions: The crash occurs when there are 5 CDPs for the hub router to fetch the CRL. Since there are multiple CDPs, the hub router fetches the CRL in a parallel way, which leads to a crash under a timing issue.

Workaround: Setting up one CDP instead of multiple CDPs will avoid the timing condition that leads to the crash.

* CSCud66955

Symptoms: SPA-2CHT3-CE-ATM is flapping with Nortel Passport due to the fast bouncing of up or down 10s, after the interface is brought up.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in E3 and DS3 mode.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud67105

Symptoms: Virtual-Access is not removed when “clear ip nhrp” or “clear crypto session” are issued or when spoke-spoke FlexVPN session is gone. This is seen only in case of FlexVPN.

Conditions: This symptom is seen only when CSCuc45115 is already in image.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud68830

Symptoms: End to end L3 traffic is affected if the host queue (cpu queue 2) increments continuously at high rates (2000 packets and above).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the host queue (cpu queue 2) increments continuously at high rates (2000 packets and above).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud69421

Symptoms: The router crashes continuously after downgrade with mode 3.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you set the SDM preferred template to mode 3 and reload with the XE37 image.

Workaround: After the router crashes, boot with any XE38/mcp\_dev image and set the SDM preferred template to mode 4 (mode 2) and boot with the XE37 image.

* CSCud71606

Symptoms: The LSMPI Tracebacks errors are seen while clearing IP routes multiple times.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Configuring OSPF

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Has more than 1000 OSPF neighbor, which will make OSPF LSU packet get fragmented

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Clear IP OSPF process \* and OSPF will send LSU packet, which triggers this error message

>Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud78649

Symptoms: The following error message occurs when activating SBC:

SBC: SBC ^T^U^V not configured

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you run the activate command just after the media-address ipv4... command, as shown below:

ASR-1001-CCN-7(config)#sbc test ASR-1001-CCN-7(config-sbc)#sbe ASR-1001-CCN-7(config-sbc-sbe)#media-address ipv4 1.20.0.2 vrf vrfa ASR-1001-CCN-7(config-sbc-media-address)#activate SBC: SBC ^A^T not configured

Workaround: Exit SBC first, then enter SBC again and then run the activate command.

* CSCud84695

Symptoms: Serial interface with FRF.12 feature is not coming up.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the flags related to FRF.12 feature are not properly updated in Elocal UCODE table.

Workaround: There is no work around.

* CSCud86240

Symptoms: The Cisco ASR 1000 ESP crashes (ucode core file created) when compressed packets are sent on a Multilink PPP interface using the Cisco IOS XE 3.5 Release and earlier Cisco ASR 1000 software images. On Cisco IOS XE 3.6 Release and later on Cisco ASR 1000 software images a crash does not occur, but routed traffic on configured interfaces are not forwarded.

However, local traffic between the peer routers may still be forwarded. In all releases, routed traffic will be dropped on any other interfaces (for example, PPP, Multilink PPP, HDLC, and so on.) configured for this mode of compression.

Conditions: This symptom is observed if the legacy IOS compression feature compress [mppc | stac | predictor] is configured on any interface (for example, PPP, Multilink PPP, HDLC, and so on.).

If this feature is configured on a Multilink PPP interface then the ESP crash can be encountered if using an Cisco IOS XE 3.5 Release and an earlier Cisco ASR 1000 software image.

Workaround: Remove the compress [mppc | stac | predictor] feature configuration from all interfaces as this functionality is not supported on the Cisco ASR 1000 router. The software fix associated with this bug report will be removing this configuration option from the Cisco ASR 1000 router.

* CSCud90457

Symptoms: The serial interface of CE interfaces connected to the CEM interfaces on PE remain down on router reload with scaled configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you have CESoP and SAToP scaled circuits and perform a router reload.

Workaround: Perform IM OIR to resolve the issue.

* CSCud96075

Symptoms: A router running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M2 will reload with a bus error soon after the DSP reloads when there is a live transcoding session.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M2.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud99911

Symptoms: There may be a delay of 15 seconds or more before switching over to a backup pseudowire in a pseudowire redundancy configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on the Cisco ME 3600 platform when the attachment circuit is a VLAN.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue00726

Symptom: There is no functional impact to the system performance, warning messages will be seen only during initialization of the router and there are no security concerns on these units:

\*Dec 16 17:58:02.432: IOSXE\_PLATFORM-3-WDC\_INVALID\_LENGTH WDC length can not be determined: 65535

\*Dec 16 17:58:10.703: PLATFORM\_SCC-1-AUTHENTICATION\_FAIL Chassis authentication failed \*Dec 16 17:58:10.703: IOSXE\_AUTHENTICATE-2-AUTHENTICATE\_FAILED. The platform authentication failed

Conditions: Programming of Quack & WDC (Watch Dog Certificate) was accidentally disabled in manufacturing during the regression testing. This caused units to ship without Quack & WDC programming. These messages show up at boot up for those specific units that had the quack disabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Field Action: Strategy for Field Units:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Update Cisco IOS to remove authentication error messages for impacted serial numbers only. This action is In progress.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Target code releases with the update include Cisco XE 3.7.3 and Cisco XE3.8.1 and later.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) TAC teams have the effective serial number list. Customers will be given a choice to upgrade to new Cisco IOS image (availability to be confirmed) or RMA the unit.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Customer also have the option to take no action if they want to ignore this message.

* CSCue03316

Symptoms: The box crashed during scale testing.

Conditions: During scale testing, the box runs out of memory resulting in MALLOCFAIL. Memory malled is not checked for failure resulting in crash.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue03418

Symptoms: The OSPF protocol flaps may be noticed on executing the “redundancy force switchover” or on switchover. These are seen very intermittently and can cause about 20 to 30 seconds of traffic loss.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on SSO or executing the redundancy force-switchover command and on a HA system with 6 seconds as OSPF “dead-interval”.

Workaround: Increase the dead-interval value.

* CSCue05358

Symptoms: “Collect Identifier mac-address” -- for routed session is not working for the client who roams to a new interface.

Conditions: This symptom is observed if the subscriber already has a session available in Interface 1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Symptoms: The following error message is logged during churning of EoGRE GTP sessions.

Traceback %IDMGR-3-INVALID\_ID: bad id in id\_get (Out of IDs!)

Conditions: This traceback is logged while churning 18,000 EoGRE GTP sessions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue17123

Symptoms: The ATM/IMA ping fails from 2nd interface post SSO in Cisco IOS XE 3.9 Release.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when you have multiple ATM interfaces and issue switchover. Traffic does not flow from 2nd interface after switchover.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue18133

Symptoms: The Cisco 7600 Router crashes at show\_li\_users.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

 1. In li-view, create an username: lawful-intercept and li\_user password: lab1.

 2. Then, attempt its delete by “no username li\_user”.

 3. Later, show users of LI.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue25575

Symptoms: The crash is observed for SDP pass through or call forward or antitrombone cases.

Conditions: The crash is observed for a basic call involving SDP pass through or call forward or antitrombone cases.

Workaround: There no workaround.

* CSCue27652

Symptoms: The ATM interfaces are getting deleted on SSO.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the ATM Interfaces are deleted on standby after IM OIR.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue27698

Symptoms: Configuring long list of REP block port preferred VLAN will result in losing part of this configuration after the reload.

Example: Configuration like this

rep block port preferred vlan 76-86,94,98,200-201,400,592-593,606-607,611,633,635-636,638,640,643,901-902,1026, 1539,2007-2064

will result in two lines in running configuration:

rep block port preferred vlan 76-86,94,98,200-201,400,592-593,606-607,611,633

rep block port preferred vlan 635-636,638,640,643,901-902,1026,1539,2007-2064

after the reload second line will overwrite the first and only one line will remain:

rep block port preferred vlan 635-636,638,640,643,901-902,1026,1539,2007-2064

Conditions: This symptom is observed after the reload.

Workaround: Reconfigure the REP block list after the reload.

* CSCue30237

Symptoms: The CFM trace route fails.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in CFM with VPLS in the core. Configure the Up MEP on BD which has the VFI terminated.

Workaround: There is no workaround. The issue is specific to VPLS in the core and Up MEP on the same BD.

* CSCue30590

Symptoms: Packet loss are seen over pseudowire and high CPU.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when IPv6 site-local multicast MAC traffic is sent over SVI EoMPLS, the traffic is looped between the PE of the EoMPLS.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue31321

Symptoms: A Cisco router or switch may unexpectedly reload due to bus error or SegV when running the how ip cef... detail command.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the output becomes paginated (---More---) and the state of the CEF adjacency changes while the prompt is waiting on the more prompt.

Workaround: Set “term len 0” before running the how ip cef... detail command.

* CSCue38489

Symptoms: Multicast packets (both data and control) get duplicated when they egress out of the port channel with ten gigabit interface members.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when we create the below configurations. Duplicate packets with Service Instance/ EFPs for multicast packets arise when the below conditions are true:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The port channel has only ten gigabit interfaces as members.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Multicast, unlearnt unicast, or broadcast packets egress out on the port channel interface.

But after reloading the box with the given configurations, the problem is seen only when admin shut/no shut is performed at least once on the port channel interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue40354

Symptoms: CPUHOG error message is seen at nile\_mgr\_bdomain\_get\_efp\_count and then followed by a crash.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on booting the router with scaled mVPN configurations.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue43250

Symptoms: IMA configuration will not be parsed correctly after the router reload, when the A903-IM40S is inserted in Bay4/Bay5 of the ASR903 router.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the IMA and ATM interfaces are adjacent. This happens only for IM inserted on Bay 4 or above.

Workaround: Insert the IM in bay 0 bay 3 if you want the IMA and ATM parsing to work, or reconfigure the ATM and IMA interfaces, for it to work.

* CSCue43776

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf20537

Symptoms: The router crashes due to null pointer dereference.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with the C4 VSS system (2 sup vss) with dual-homed fex stack (This has not been seen on other platforms, but the fix is ported as a precautionary measure). During the first SSO, no crash is observed [Active and Standby (Hot-Standby)]. During the second SSO, a is crash observed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf25555

Symptoms: Policy-based routing stops working after the router reloads.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when multiple next-hops configured on the same route map are reachable through the same interface.

Workaround: Remove and reconfigure the route-map.

Further Problem Description: This is a specific scenario where multiple next-hops configured on the same route map are reachable through the same physical interface on different VLANs.

After reload, when the physical interface comes up, adjacency for all configured next-hops on different sequence numbers of the same route map were notified to the PD client simultaneously.

* CSCuf30554

Symptoms: A traffic drop is seen with scalable EoMPLS VCs going over TE tunnels. The issue is reproduced if a large or small number of tunnels are present and they undergo a lot of flap events.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the MPLS label for a TE internal label gets allocated with a value having more than 20 bit.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf43548

Symptoms: When the POS Rx fiber at the tail end of the MPLS TE FRR is pulled, the FRR takes longer than 200ms to cut over to the other tunnel.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with POS MPLS TE FRR when the head end receives a remote defect due to the Rx fiber pull at the tail end. Remote defects do not trigger FRR quickly.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf65255

Symptoms: CPU hog is caused by unnecessary calling of avl\_get\_next to calculate the dynamic MPLS label range for each of the service instances configured (especially for L3VPN services).

Conditions: This symptom occurs under the following conditions:

 1. When running configuration is accessed using the “show running-config” CLI.

 2. While copying running configuration to either the startup configuration or the local disk or the tftp server.

This results in the copy operation taking more than 300 seconds (for an average configuration size of 1000kB).

Workaround: Reducing the number of BGP routes injected for L3VPN sessions causes the CPU hog to last for a smaller duration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when multiple routers in the network are reloaded simultaneously.

Workaround: Using the clear ip mroute vrf vrf name command may resolve the issue.

* CSCtz34869

Symptoms: Aps-channel stops working.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with an open ring and is seen in the following scenario:

A1(po2)(RPL)<======>(po2)A3 (gig3/2)<=======>(gig3/3)A4

Shut down gig3/2 on A3 does not make A1 into protection.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Debugs show no SF packets are being transmitted to A1 which is connected to A3 via “Port-channel”.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A1 (po2) is RPL of the ring. It is not going to be unblocked even after the A3-A4 link goes down.

Workaround: Reload the line card.

* CSCtz50683

Symptoms: Upon removing 10 x MDLP sessions, one or more hardware adj remains. This happens due to incorrect removal of LSPs.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when more than eight sub-LSPs occur.

Workaround: Use no more than eight sub-LSPs.

* CSCtz55979

Symptoms: The router crashes.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you configure CFM, SCE over MPLS, VPLS, or G.8032 services while running SNMP polling.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz58391

Symptoms: Ingress QoS Tcams are not cleared after certain dynamic changes.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on removing the encapsulation from the service instance and then deleting the service instance. QoS Tcams are not cleared.

Workaround: Instead of deleting the encapsulation first, delete the service instance first.

* CSCtz88879

Symptoms: When testing for DMVPN in a HUB-SPOKE topology, where there are 170 tunnels protected with IPsec on Spoke and one mGRE tunnel on hub. B2B redundancy is configured. No QoS is applied on the scaled IPsec tunnels. Upon doing SSO with this configuration, the “%VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnelx: allocated idb has invalid vlan id” error message is seen repeatedly on the new active and the router becomes almost inaccessible. As can be seen from the show vlan int usage command output, there are more than 3K free VLANs on both the hub and spoke.

\*May 14 12:31:10.315: %VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnel87: allocated idb has invalid vlan id

\*May 14 12:31:10.511: %VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnel26: allocated idb has invalid vlan id

\*May 14 12:31:10.543: %VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnel28: allocated idb has invalid vlan id

\*May 14 12:31:10.575: %VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnel90: allocated idb has invalid vlan id

After a continuous flood of error messages, a Granikos crash is seen, and the show cry eli command shows only one SPA and this SPA is stuck in INIT state.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when doing a shut/no shut using the interface range command, and once all tunnels are up, doing an SSO.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua01641

Symptoms: The router’s NAS-IP address contained in the RADIUS accounting-on packet is 0.0.0.0:

RADIUS: Acct-Session-Id [44] 10 "00000001" RADIUS: Acct-Status-Type [40] 6 Accounting-On [7] RADIUS: NAS-IP-Address [4] 6 0.0.0.0

RADIUS: Acct-Delay-Time [41] 6 0

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you restart the router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua12396

Symptoms: IPv6 multicast routing is broken when there are master switchover scenarios with a large number of members in stack. This issue is seen on platforms such as Cisco 3750E and Cisco 3750X where IPV6 multicast routing is supported.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when IPV6 multicast routing is configured, mcast routes are populated, and traffic is being forwarded. In case of master switchover, synchronization between the master and members is disrupted. This issue is seen only for IPv6 multicast routing. This issue has been observed with a 9-member stack and either during the first or second master switchover. No issues are seen for IPv4 multicast routing.

Workaround: This scenario was tested with a 5-member stack, and no issues were seen. It is recommended to enable IPv6 multicast routing when there is deployment with low members in a stack.

* CSCua15003

Symptoms: When a call is canceled mid-call, the CUBE may not release the transcoder resource for the call. As a result, there is a DSP resource leak.

Conditions: This symptom can occur in the following situations:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) CUBE receives 180 ringing with an SDP session.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) “media transcoder high-density” is enabled.

Workaround: Disable “media transcoder high-density”.

* CSCua20373

Symptoms: After SSO, all the GRE tunnels get admin down and stay down until the security module SSC-600/WS-IPSEC-3 comes up. Complete traffic loss is seen during this time.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when Vanilla GRE tunnels are configured in the system where HA and the IPsec Module SSC-600/WS-IPSEC-3 card is present, “crypto engine mode vrf” is configured, and SSO is issued.

Workaround: Remove the “cryto engine mode vrf” configuration if IPsec is not enabled on the router.

* CSCua24689

Symptoms: Fragments are sent without label resulting in packet drops on the other side.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) MPLS enabled DMVPN tunnel on egress.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) VFR on ingress.

Workaround: Disable VFR, if possible.

* CSCua26064

Symptoms: IPv6 routes in the global routing table take up different adjacency entries.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when there are four core facing tunnels that load balance traffic to these prefixes. The show mls cef ipv6 prefix detail command shows the different adjacencies taken by different prefixes.

Workaround: Have a single tunnel on the core facing side, instead of a load balanced path.

* CSCua31934

Symptoms: A crash is seen at \_\_be\_address\_is\_unspecified.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. It occurs one out of three times and it is a timing issue.

 2. DMVPN tunnel setup between Cisco 2901 as the spoke and Cisco ASR 1000 as the hub.

 3. Pass IPv4 and IPv6 traffic between the hub and the spoke for 5-10 minutes.

 4. It can occur with v6 traffic alone.

 5. If you remove the tunnel interface on the Cisco ASR and add it again using  **conf replace nvram:startup-config** command, the crash will occur.

Workaround: Use CLI to change configuration instead of the rollback feature.

* CSCua39390

* CSCua41333

Symptoms: A crash occurs at \_\_be\_ipsub\_dp\_disconnect\_session with DHCP scale when routed/L2-connected sessions are brought up/down one after the other.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you bring up scale routed DHCP sessions, later bring them down, and then bring up scale L2-connected DHCP sessions on the same interface or vice versa.

Workaround: Reload the router after changing the configuration.

* CSCua42523

Symptoms: The router crashes and reloads when “options-keepalive” is enabled on a dial peer which has session target as sip-server.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when enabling “options-keepalive” which has a session target as sip-server. Also, “sip-server” is configured under “sip-ua” and has a DNS address which resolves to an IPv6 address.

Workaround: Do not enable “options-keepalive” for dial peer.

* CSCua45206

Symptoms: The hub router crashes while removing the Stale Cache entry.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when two spokes are translated to the same NAT address.

Workaround: Spokes behind the same NAT box must be translated to different post-NAT Addresses.

* CSCua49764

Symptoms: The WAAS-Express device goes offline on WCM.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a certificate is generated using HTTPS when using the Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)T image. Once upgraded to Cisco IOS Release 15.2(3)T, the WAAS-Express device goes offline on WCM.

Workaround: Configure an rsakeypair on the TP-self-signed trustpoint with the same name and execute the enroll command again or delete the self-signed trustpoint point and reenable the HTTP secure-server.

* CSCua55785

Symptoms: Build breakage occurs due to the fix of CSCtx34823.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with the CSCtx34823 fix.

Workaround: CSCtx34823 change may be unpatched from the code-base.

* CSCua56999

Symptoms: Abnormal line card reload occurs.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when an MVPNv6 scaled router acts as PE on which source traffic is ingressing and the line card is connected on the access side.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua61330

Symptoms: Traffic loss is observed during switchover if,

 1. BGP graceful restart is enabled.

 2. The next-hop is learned by BGP.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on a Cisco router running Cisco IOS XE Release 3.5S.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua81998

Symptoms: Doing ISSU RV in a Cisco 7600 box with the ES40 line card may sometimes cause a crash in the ES40 line card.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with ISSU RV with Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7S, or Cisco IOS XE Release 3.8S to Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.1S.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua82440

Symptoms: FNF records do not get exported when a user reloads the router.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if a user configures a nondefault export-protocol, that is, anything other than “netflow-v9”. If the user configures a nondefault export-protocol such as IPFIX or netflow-v5, after saving the configuration to the start-up configuration and reloading the router, the exporter will not export any records.

Workaround: Either one of the following methods will fix this issue:

 1. Remove and reconfigure the exporter configuration after reload.

 2. Change the export-protocol to the default value (netflow-v9).

Conditions: This symptom is observed between two BGP peers with matching MD5 passwords configured and can be triggered by the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If the midpoint path has the “mtu” or “ip mtu” setting that is smaller than the outgoing interface on BGP routers, it will be force the BGP router to fragment the BGP packet while sending packets through the outgoing interface.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Peering down and the MD5 error do not always occur. They occur only once or twice within 10 tests.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua85604

Symptoms: Ingress Qos on EVC stops working after reload or after interface flap.

Conditions: This symptom occurs only on EVC QOS.

* CSCua90061

Symptoms: The WS-IPSEC-3 Module crashes post configuration change.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you dynamically modify the GRE tunnel protected with IPsec to the sVTI tunnel and vice versa while traffic is traversing across the IPsec tunnel.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua91473

Symptoms: Memory leak occurs during rekey on the IPsec key engine process.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after rekey, when the IPsec key engine does not release KMI memory, causing the IPsec key engine holding memory to keep increasing.

Workaround: Clear crypto session for IPsec key engine to release memory.

* CSCua91698

Symptoms: ephone-type disappears from the running-configuration.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in SRST mode and after reload.

Workaround: Reconfigure the ephone-type commands and again save to the startup-configuration.

* CSCua99969

Symptoms: IPv6 PIM null-register is not sent in the VRF context.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in the VRF context.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub04112

Symptoms: The router may lose OSPF routes pointing to the reconfigured OSPF interface.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after quick removal and adding of the interface IP address by script or copy and paste.

For example, configure the following:

interface Ethernet0/0

 ip address 1.1.100.200 255.255.255.0

 ip ospf network point-to-point

 ip ospf 1 area 0

end

Then, quickly remove/add the IP address:

conf t

interface Ethernet0/0

 no ip address 1.1.100.200 255.255.255.0

 ip address 1.1.100.200 255.255.255.0

 ip ospf network point-to-point

 ip ospf 1 area 0

end

Workaround: Insert a short delay in between commands for removing/adding the IP address. The delay should be longer than the wait interval for LSA origination; by default, it is 500 ms. Or, refresh the routing table by “clear ip route \*”.

* CSCub04345

Symptoms: The Cisco ASR-1002-X freezes after four hours with a scaled “path-jitter” sla probe configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a scaled “path-jitter” sla probe configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub04982

Symptoms: In an IPFRR configuration, a traceback is seen about changing the FRR primary OCE where the new OCE has a different interface and next-hop, which blocks such a linkage.

Conditions: This symptom occurs while changing the FRR primary OCE interface to a new OCE with a different interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub06859

Symptoms: OSPFv2 NSR on quad-sup VSS does not work. The router stops sending hello packets after switchover.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with quad-sup VSS with OSPFv2 NSR.

Workaround: Clear the IP OSPF process after NSR switchover.

* CSCub07855

Symptoms: The VRF error message is displayed in the router.

Conditions: This symptom occurs upon router bootup.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub15105

Symptoms: Traffic drop of MVPNv6 data MDT packets is seen.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on doing a VRF delete and adding it on the encapsulated PE in a scaled MVPNv6 setup; the L3 DENY RESULT drop counters increment for the encapsulated VLAN v4. From a multicast point of view, the drop is at the point where the packet reaches the encapsulated VLAN v4 to proceed further with backbone forwarding.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub15402

Symptoms: A VRF cannot be deleted. The following error message is displayed:

error message "% Deletion of VRF VPNA in progress; wait for it to complete".

Conditions: This symptom occurs after having previously issued “sh ip cef vrf \* sum”.

Workaround: There is no workaround. Reboot is required to remove the VRF.

* CSCub22049

Symptoms: Native MCAST traffic is not forwarded over a nile1 after core interface shut/no shut.

Conditions: This symptom is observed after doing shut/no shut or interface flap a couple of times.

Workaround: “clear ip mroute <mcast\_group>” or “clear ip route \*”.

Further Problem Description: Not all the multicast groups will be affected. The behavior is inconsistent.

* CSCub23231

Symptoms: Very specific events/packet types cause the ES20 LC to stop passing traffic. Information on these events and packets that lead to the issue are not known currently.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the ES20 interface has an EVC or MPLS configuration.

Workaround: Reload LC.

* CSCub31477

Symptoms: A Cisco ISG router configured for Layer 2 Connected Subscriber Sessions does not respond to ARP replies once a subscriber ARP cache has expired.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the router is configured as ISG L2-Connect, the router has configured HSRP as the high-availability method, and the subscriber-facing interface is configured with “no ip proxy arp”. This issue is not seen if either HSRP is removed or if “ip proxy arp” is enabled.

Workaround: Clear the subscriber session. After the subscriber is reintroduced, the issue is resolved. You can also configure “ip proxy arp” on the HSRP-configured interface.

* CSCub33470

Symptoms: Default profiles showing up as custom.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a Cisco Catalyst 3000/Catalyst 4000 platform which supports the IP SLA video operation. This issue has no affect on the operation itself.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub34595

Symptoms: Enabling Dynamic ARP Resolution (DAI) on a VLAN may cause ARP resolution to fail for hosts in other VLANs.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when enabling DAI on a VLAN.

Workaround 1: Enable DAI for the failing VLAN using the ip arp inspection vlan x command.

For example:

ip arp inspection vlan 30

 int gi 0/10

 ip arp inspection trust

 int gi 0/11

 ip arp inspection trust

Workaround 2: Enable DAI for the failing VLAN using the ip arp inspection vlan x command. Configure an ARP ACL to permit traffic for a valid IP source + MAC source pair using the arp access- list acl\_name command. Configure the DAI filter and associate with the ARP ACL using the ip arp inspection filter acl\_name vlan x command. Configure the DAI trust on the egress port using the ip arp inspection trust.

For example:

ip arp inspection vlan 20

 arp access-list testacl

 permit ip 10.1.1.3 255.255.255.0 mac 01:00:00:0E:0E:0F

 ip arp inspection filter testacl vlan 20

 int gig0/10

 ip arp inspection trust

* CSCub34756

Symptoms: RP crash is observed at rrr\_lm\_resource\_link\_ready after performing SSO on the midpoint router on protect LSP.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when an RP card hosting the TP tunnel midpoint is undergoing the SSO operation. During SSO recovery, the TP fails to recover the TP tunnel midpoint interface (virtual) that is causing it to send a NULL interface to TE for checking its readiness. TE is not checking the NULL pointer condition and accessing the link elements that are causing the crash.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub36356

Symptoms: Scaling up routes result in huge memory allocations, eventually depleting the SP memory, leading to MALLOC FAIL and subsequent system crash.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in normal conditions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub38559

Symptoms: When static recursive routes are used in an MVPNv6 environment, multicast traffic loss can occur due to failure to determine the correct RPF interface for a multicast source or rendezvous point.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if a static route to an IPv6 address at a remote site (remote side of a VPN cloud) resolves via a BGP route, resulting in a failure to install the required MDT alternate next-hop in the recursively referenced BGP route.

Workaround: Executing “show ipv6 rpf vrf X <address>” for any address within the recursively referenced BGP prefix range will cause installation of the required alternate next-hop.

* CSCub39296

Symptoms: Unexpected exception to CPU: vector 200, PC = 0x0. Traceback decode is irrelevant.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on the ES+ series linecards on a Cisco 7600 series router. Symptom is reported on the ES+ console and in the crashinfo file on the ES+ flash disk. It is not reported in the syslog.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub45809

Symptoms: Cisco IOS configured for Voice over IP may experience stack corruption due to multiple media loops.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a special configuration of IP features, along with disabling the recommended  **media flow-around** command. This issue is seen with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)T.

Workaround: Apply the  **media flow-around** command.

Symptoms: MPLS pseudowire ping from the peer to the Cisco ASR 903 fails if the peer is using TTL-based ping.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the peer is using TTL-based ping.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub53398

Symptoms: The router crashes on bootup.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the router is booted up with a scaled MVPNv6 configuration. This issue is highly dependent on the “back walk” timing and sequence; hence, the probability to encounter the issue is low.

Workaround: Disable power to all DFC modules on reload and bring them up one by one post reload.

* CSCub54261

Symptoms: In an MLDP + MVPNv6 setup, abnormal RP reload occurs after the deletion and addition of few subinterfaces on the encapsulated PE.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after deletion and addition of few subinterfaces on the router acting as the encapsulated PE on the access side for a few VRFs running MLCP inband.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub58312

Symptoms: When IGMP query with source IP address 0.0.0.0 is received on an interface, it is marked as mrouter port for that VLAN.

Router#show ip igmp int vlan 1

Vlan1 is up, line protocol is up

 IGMP querying router is 0.0.0.0 <----

Router#sh ip igmp snooping mrouter

vlan ports

-----+----------------------------------------

 1 Po1,Po8,Router<-----

Conditions: This symptom is observed when IGMP query with source IP address 0.0.0.0 is received.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub68933

Symptoms: Incorrect MAC learning is observed over pseudowires that are part of HVPLS, causing traffic failure.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when VPLS autodiscovery is in use, with MPLS over SVI in the core. This issue is also seen with LDP-based VPLS, when split horizon-enabled pseudowires are configured after the non-split horizon-enabled pseudowires.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub70336

Symptoms: The router can crash when “clear ip bgp \*” is done in a large-scale scenario.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only in a large-scale scenario, with tens of thousands of peers and several VPNv4/v6 prefixes.

Workaround: “clear ip bgp \*” is not a very common operation. Hence, this issue has not been observed by customers. The crash can only happen when “clear ip bgp \*” is done. The workaround is not to execute “clear ip bgp \*”.

* CSCub73177

Symptoms: RP crash occurs.

Conditions: This symptom occurs upon router reload

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub73787

Symptoms: The RSP720 may crash if a high rate of traffic is punted to the RP.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on a Cisco 7600 with RSP720. It is specific to a driver used only by the RSP720. Other supervisor models are not affected. The issue is only seen in Cisco IOS Release 15.1(03)S and later releases, because of a code change made to the RSP720 driver.

Workaround: Isolate and stop the traffic being punted to the RP.

* CSCub79035

Symptoms: Multicast traffic will get route cached on the receiver/decap node resulting in traffic drop and slight increase in RP/SP CPU.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when multicast traffic flowing over GRE tunnel protected with IPsec and PIM is enabled on the GRE tunnel.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub79590

Symptoms: The match user-group commands do not appear in the running configuration after being configured.

Configure an inspection type class-map:

class-map type inspect TEST

 match protocol tcp

 match user-group cisco

Save the configuration. Try to view the configuration in the running configuration:

hostname# show run class-map

building configuration...

Current configuration : 66 bytes

!

class-map type inspect match-all TEST

 match protocol tcp

end

But, view the configuration directly in the class-map:

hostname# show class-map type inspect

 Class Map type inspect match-all TEST (id 1)

 Match protocol tcp

 Match user-group cisco

The configuration never shows up in the running configuration, but it is in the class-map configuration. As a note, the functionality exists on the ZBFW, but the configuration does not show up in the running configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is only observed with the match user-group commands.

Workaround: This issue only affects devices after a reload as the router will read the startup configuration, which will not have the match user-group command. As a result, the match user-group commands need to be reentered after ever reload.

* CSCub80386

Symptoms: The following interface configuration should be used:

interface Ethernet2/1

description lanethernet1

ipv6 enable

ospfv3 100 network manet

ospfv3 100 ipv6 area 0

Dead interval is calculated according to network type; in this case, it is 120s. Issue the no ospfv3 dead-intervalcommand on dead interval. Dead interval is set to the default of 40s instead of 120s, which is correct for manet or P2MP interface types.

Conditions: This symptom is an OSPFv3-specific issue (see the configuration example).

Workaround: Configure dead interval explicitly or reapply the network command.

* CSCub80710

Symptoms: SSL handshake between Cisco VCS and the Cisco ASR fails if the Cisco ASR is running Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7S.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in a working setup, if the Cisco ASR is upgraded to Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7S, then SSL handshake and subsequently SIP-TLS calls start to fail. If in the same setup, the Cisco ASR is downgraded back to Cisco IOS XE Release 3.5S or Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4.4S, then the calls work (without requiring any additional changes).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub82471

Symptoms: BFD session flapping occurs or fails to get established on flapping REP ring.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the software BFD session or echo mode.

Workaround: Disable echo mode.

* CSCub86706

Symptoms: After multiple RP switchover, the router crashes with the “UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = BGP HA SSO” error.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with MVPN with 500 VRFs, when performing multiple switchovers on PE1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub87579

Symptoms: Multicast traffic gets forwarded to the wrong tunnel protected with IPsec.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when Multicast (PIM) is enabled on the GRE tunnel protected with IPsec on the Cisco 7600.

Workaround: Shut/no shut on the tunnel protected with IPsec resolves the issue.

* CSCub88742

Symptoms: A crash occurs due to NULL pointer access in a BGP C-Route function.

Conditions: This symptom is very timing-sensitive and occurs only in a specific sequence of runtime events at a specific timing instance. In this case, it is triggered on a scaled setup when “mpls mldp” is toggled after two SSOs and when each SSO takes a very long time to complete due to HA Bulk Sync failure in IP Multicast that has addresses separately.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub89711

Symptoms: The  **atm** keyword for the **show**  command disappears.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you do a powered shutdown of the SPA card and bring it back up using the  **no** form the previous command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub91428

Symptoms: Internal VLAN is not deleted even after waiting for 20 minutes, and the VLAN cannot be reused.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with any internal VLAN allocated dynamically that is not freed up after 20 minutes in the pending queue.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub91429

Symptoms: CEF does not get programmed and traffic does not flow across IPv6 VTI tunnels post router reload.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when reloading the box that has scale IPv6 sVTI IPsec tunnels configured.

Workaround: Shutdown/no shutdown on the IPv6 tunnels resolves the issue.

* CSCub91546

Symptoms: Traffic is dropped silently on the VLAN.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when all the VLANs in the router are used (0 free VLAN). Any new internal VLAN creation will fail, and an appropriate error message is not shown.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub91815

Symptoms: Certificate validation fails with a valid certificate.

Conditions: This symptom is observed during DMVPN setup with an empty CRL cache. This issue is usually seen on the responder side, but the initiator can also show this behavior.

Workaround: There is no known workaround.

* CSCub94438

Symptoms: Traceback is observed with the following error message:

SP-STDBY: pm\_get\_standby\_vlan:Cannot allocate VLAN for IPv6 VPN 0x1E000050 Egress multicast VLAN 1019 is use by Tunnel2

Conditions: This symptom occurs when applying a scaled MLDP configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub95141

Symptoms: FP Pending Refs are observed when “crypto map <> local-address loopbackX” is removed from the configuration when the crypto map is applied on a subinterface.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following configuration:

crypto map cry local-address Loopback0

interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0.100 crypto map cry

interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0.200 crypto map cry

Workaround: Remove “crypto map” from the subinterface first and then remove “crypto map <> local-address loopbackX”.

* CSCub98385

Symptoms: CFMoXconnect remote MEPs are not learned.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with CfmoXconnect on the Cisco ME3600X and TE tunnels in the core. This issue is seen when the core link is mapped to NILE 1.

Workaround: Remove TE tunnels in the core or have the core link on NILE 0.

* CSCuc05570

Symptoms: The “PM-SP-STDBY-3-INTERNALERROR” error message is seen on Active for the Tunnel Reserved VLAN and the Tunnel Global Reserved VLAN.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with an HA router with a scale configuration of the MDT Tunnel.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc06024

Symptoms: Traffic flowing through EVCs that do not belong to any service group will see incorrect bandwidth values because of wrong bandwidth value programmed on the port-default node.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when a mixture of flat and HQoS SGs having bandwidth configurations on their policies are applied on PC EVCs. Two mem- links are part of this PC, and default load-balancing is used.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc10586

Symptoms: In the Cisco 7600, multicast traffic does not flow in some scenarios. In the case of PIM SM mode, many times, (\*,G) is present, but not (S,G) in mroute. In the case of PIM SSM mode, (S,G) is present but still traffic does not flow through.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only with Cisco IOS Release 15S-based releases.

Workaround:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Either use a different source IP or a different group IP.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Reload the module.

* CSCuc10706

Symptoms: When Cisco IOS XE is configured to use subscriber-service for authorization, it will ignore this configuration for the named list and fall back on the default for subscriber-profile or, if this is not present, on the default authorization method for the network. If none of these default authorization methods are configured, authorization will not take place.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a named authorization list is configured.

Workaround: Set the default authorization list (subscriber-service or network) to use the correct Radius server.

* CSCuc11853

Symptoms: T1 controller will stay DOWN after switchover.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when SATOP is configured on T1.

Workaround: Do a shut and no shut.

* CSCuc13992

Symptoms: The Cisco IOSd process crashes due to a segmentation fault in the PPP process:

UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = PPP Events

The root cause for the PPP process crash is wrong IPCP option processing inside PPP control packets.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the BRAS functionality is configured, which includes ISG and PPPoE session termination.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc14088

Symptoms: The default class is not being exported with the class option template.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when class-default is not exported when typing the option c3pl-class-table under the flow exporter.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. The platform supports hot standby (Cisco ASR 903/Cisco 7600/Cisco ASR 901).

 2. PW redundancy with primary down.

 3. Configuration removed + added or added afresh.

Workaround: Fix the primary PW and then remove/add the configuration.

* CSCuc34088

Symptoms: The router passes lower traffic levels when you add links to an IMA bundle and perform IM OIR/router reload.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you send traffic above the E1 line rate on one link within an IMA bundle and perform IM OIR.

Workaround: Removing and re-applying the IMA interface brings it back up

* CSCuc34574

Symptoms: A pending-issue-update is seen at SSL CPP CERT on the Cisco ASR 1002, ESP-1000 platform.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following configuration:

Workaround: There is no workaround. Most remote devices should ignore this behavior by design, but some devices may display unexpected behavior, such as for IPCP PROTREJ messages.

* CSCuc44555

Symptoms: Multicast traffic is not forwarded to downstream, even when the groups show up in the group list.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only when the traffic comes on RPF fail interface, and the downstream port is blocked due to STP or similar protocol.

Workaround: Disable IGMP snooping.

* CSCuc45115

Symptoms: EIGRP flapping is seen continuously on the hub. A crash is seen at nhrp\_add\_static\_map.

Conditions: This symptom is observed after shut/no shut on the tunnel interface, causing a crash at the hub. A related issue is also seen when there is no IPv6 connectivity between the hub and spoke, causing continuous EIGRP flapping on the hub.

Workaround: There is no known workaround.

* CSCuc45528

Symptoms: Incremental leaks are seen at :\_\_be\_nhrp\_recv\_error\_indication.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the NHRP error indication is received on the box. This issue is seen only if CSCub93048 is already present in the image. CSCub93048 is available from Cisco IOS Release 15.3M&T onwards.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc46356

Symptoms: The router hangs and crashes by WDOG.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when IPv6 ACL is applied to a port-ch sub-if. The sub-if is deleted followed by deletion of the ACL.

Workaround: Delete the ACL before deleting the port-ch sub-if.

* CSCuc47399

Symptoms: IKEv2 STOP Accounting records show wrong counters for packets/octets, when the sessions are locally cleared using “clear crypto sa” or “clear crypto session”.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the latest Cisco IOS XE Release 3.8S images when IKEV2-Accouting is enabled. This issue is easily reproducible with a single session, and may be service impacting as STOP Accounting records are usually used for billing purposes.

Workaround: The STOP records reflect the right counters when the disconnect is through the remote end.

* CSCuc48162

Symptoms: EVC Xconnect UP MEP is sending CCMs when the remote EFP is shut.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when EFP is admin down.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc48211

Symptoms: Traffic from the Label Edge Router (LER) is dropped at the Label Switch Router (LSR) peer. LER is using a invalid/outdated label, unknown to LSR. This issue can be seen with a regular MPLS connection over a physical interface or with a connection over an MPLS TE tunnel interface. The root cause is that LER is using CEF long-path extension, installed to the prefix by a different routing protocol in the past.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the prefix is learned by both BGP and IGP, while BGP has lower Administrative Distance, pointing via the MPLS TE tunnel carrying MPLS. This issue is seen once the prefix is installed to RIB by IGP and then by BGP (Reload, BGP flap, etc.); then, the CEF will keep using the IGP/LDPs label without updating it in case of LDP label change.

Workaround: Issue the clear ip route prefix mask command.

* CSCuc49967

Symptoms: Router crash points to the “IP SLAs XOS Event Processor” process and decodes point to “ecfm\_pal\_pd\_encap\_pak”.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when configuring IPSLA sessions with a Mac-Address that is not present in the CFM CCDB.

Workaround: This issue is not seen when Mac-Addresses are learned in CCDB.

* CSCuc51692

Symptoms: The router crashes while enabling L2TP debugs using the debug l2vpn l2tp error | event command.

Conditions: This symptom always occurs on enabling the debug l2vpn l2tp error | event command.

Workaround: The same debugs can be enabled using the alternate command debug xcl2 error | event.

* CSCuc52506

Symptoms: 6PE and 6VPE traffic drops on shutting the ECMP link.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after configuring the 6PE/6VPE between UPE-2 and UPE-1 with ECMP paths between both nodes and then shutting the ECMP link.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc53135

Symptoms: LDP sessions are not established.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a router with more than one LDP adjacency to a neighbor. This issue is seen when the TCP session establishment to that neighbor is delayed, and while it is delayed, the adjacency that is the active adjacency times out (no more UDP packets are received), resulting in the TCP listen socket being deleted and not created.

Workaround: Issue the clear mpls ldp neighbor \* command.

* CSCuc56259

Symptoms: A Cisco 3945 that is running 15.2(3)T2 and running as a voice gateway may crash. Just prior to the crash, these messages can be seen:

%VOIP\_RTP-6-MEDIA\_LOOP: The packet is seen traversing the system multiple times

and

Delivery Ack could not be sent due to lack of buffers.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a media loop is created (which is due to misconfiguration or some other call forward/transfer scenarios).

Workaround: Check the configurations for any misconfigurations, especially with calls involving CUBE and CUCM.

* CSCuc57130

Symptoms: Interface configurations do not work post HA switchover.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after HA switchover and is observed with OC3 IM.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc59049

Symptoms: The Cisco ME3800x crashinfo files may be incomplete.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a crashinfo file is created when a crash occurs.

Workaround: Gather console logs and syslogs to help troubleshoot crashes.

* CSCuc59105

Symptoms: The switch may crash when issuing “show platform qos policer cpu x x”.

Conditions: This symptom occurs only when issuing “show platform qos policer cpu x x” through an SSH session with AAA configured.

Workaround: Execute the command through Telnet or the console.

* CSCuc64719

Symptoms: A Cisco ME 3600X HSRP failover is seen in VPLS.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when HSRP state changes from active to standby. The MAC address on the active router is not flushed.

Workaround: Clear the MAC table on the HSRP active router.

* CSCuc66895

Symptoms: Layer 2 traffic loop seen in REP topology for a transient time, when the Cisco ASR 903 which is a part of the REP ring is reloaded.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the Cisco ASR 903 is part of an REP ring, and the box is reloaded with saved REP configurations.

Workaround: Traffic loop is transient, once REP convergence looping is stopped.

* CSCuc67687

Symptoms: With a rare combination, and VRF-related RG configurations, the router may crash following the configuration commands.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following configuration:

R1-13RU(config-if)#ip vrf forwarding b2b-vrf

% Interface GigabitEthernet0/1/0 IPv4 disabled and address(es) removed due to

enabling VRF b2b-vrf

% Interface GigabitEthernet0/1/0 virtual IP address <ip> removed due to VRF change

% Zone security Z1 is removed due to VRF config change on interface

GigabitEthernet0/1/0

R1-13RU(config-if)#ip address <ip> <mask>

R1-13RU(config-if)#zone-member security Z1

R1-13RU(config-if)#redundancy group 1 ip <ip> exc dec 50

Workaround: There is no known workaround.

* CSCuc68246

Symptoms: The standby IOMD crashes on booting up the standby RSP.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when booting up the standby RSP with a configuration that is already present.

Workaround: Boot up the standby without any configurations and start configuration once the standby has reached STANDBY\_HOT state.

* CSCuc71706

Symptoms: Execution of the show run command and other commands such as copy run start and show access-list cause the router to stop for a few minutes before completing.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco ISR G2 routers. This issue is seen only with IPV6 configured and used.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc72244

Symptoms: On the Cisco 7609, both sides running Cisco IOS Release SRE4 SIP-400 with SPA-2X1GE-V2 configured with “negotiation Auto” and changed to “no negotiation auto”. The GE interface of the router is operating in half-duplex mode after falling back. The interface is operating in half-duplex instead of the expected (nonconfigurable) full-duplex.

Conditions: This symptom does not occur under any specific conditions. This issue is observed due to a timing constraint upon updating the duplex state.

The steps to reproduce are as follows:

 1. The interface in Router A is configured to “negotiation auto” with no change in duplex state on both sides.

 2. The interface in Router B is configured to “negotiation auto” with no change in duplex state on both sides.

 3. The interface in Router A is configured to “no negotiation auto”. The duplex state for both interfaces is changed to half-duplex.

 4. The interface in Router B is configured to “no negotiation auto”. The interface duplex state for Router B is changed to full-duplex. But, the Router A interface remains in half-duplex.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

 <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar13.html>

* CSCuc76670

Symptoms: 2X1GE-SYNCE (metronome) SPA does not boot on a 2RU (Cisco ASR 1002).

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7S onwards, when metronome SPA (2X1GE-SYNCE) fails to boot on a 2RU. An error message indicating that the SPA is not supported is displayed on the RP console.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc77283

Symptoms: Upon reload or OIR, the CFM MEP configuration on an xconnect EFP is removed and cannot be reconfigured.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a CFM MEP on xconnect service instance. This issue is seen when reload or OIR is performed.

Workaround: Remove the domain configuration.

* CSCuc77704

Symptoms: The GETVPN/GDOI Secondary Cooperative Key Server (COOP-KS) does not download the policy (that is, when the show crypto gdoi ks policy command is issued on the Secondary COOP-KS and the command output shows that no policy is downloaded) and Group Members (GMs) registering to the Secondary COOP-KS fail to register without any warning/error message.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the GETVPN/GDOI group (with COOP configured) has an IPsec profile configured with one of the following transforms in its transform-set:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) esp-sha256-hmac

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) esp-sha384-hmac

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) esp-sha512-hmac

Workaround: Use esp-sha-hmac as the authentication transform instead.

* CSCuc79161

Symptoms: Memory leak is observed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after flapping the interface, keeping the setup idle, and executing “clear xconnect”.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Further Problem Description: The PI front-end pseudoport is not deleted when the xconnect is removed, which causes the memory leak. This issue occurs because PD returns BDOMAIN\_PP\_FAILED to PI when pp\_engine\_context is a NULL pointer.

* CSCuc79923

Symptoms: On a Cisco 7600 running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1, packets from FWSM are dropped when the servicemodule session is enabled. Ping fails for the VLAN interface on the FWSM module from the supervisor. The ARP entry is incomplete on the Cisco 7600.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) This issue is seen on the Cisco 7600 with FWSM and SUP-720-3B running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The FWSM is in Crossbar mode.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The system is in “distributed” egress SPAN replication mode.

This issue is not seen with Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE7.

Workaround:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Disable the servicemodule session.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Change the fabric switching mode to bus.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Change SPAN egress replication mode to “centralized”.

* CSCuc82551

Symptoms: A Cisco ASR 1001 running Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.2S or Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7.1S crashes with SNMP traffic.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with SNMP polling with an IP SLA configuration.

* CSCuc97711

Symptoms: After SSO, traffic on the P2P-GRE tunnel within an MVPN may be affected.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release SREx- and RLSx-based releases.

Workaround: Shut/no shut the P2P tunnel interface.

* CSCuc98226

Symptoms: When a PC is moved between two VLAN ports (on one port, ISG is enabled, and the other is non-ISG) several times by its LAN cable connection on the L2SW that is connected to the Cisco ASR 1000 router, the PC becomes unable to acquire an IP address from DHCP on the router. At that time, an incorrect interface is shown in “show ip dhcp binding”.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc98590

Symptoms: The router can crash on removal of the boundary clock (BC). configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed upon removal of the BC configuration. This issue is seen very rarely, and there is no other specific trigger.

Workaround: There is no workaround. The chances of encountering this issue have been found to be remote as it is seen rarely.

* CSCud03877

Symptoms: After volume rekey, the IPsec PD flow sets both the hard and soft limit of the traffic limit to 0.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the volume rekey is set to 0.

Workaround: Clear crypto session to recover the volume rekey value.

* CSCud07856

Symptoms: SP crashes at “cfib\_update\_ipfrr\_lbl\_ref\_count”.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a scaled IP-FRR configuration.

Workaround: Remove the IP-FRR configuration.

* CSCud16693

Symptoms: The Cisco ME3600X/ME3800X switch crashes as soon as you apply policy-map referencing table-map.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when applying a service policy which has an unsupported combination of police action with table-map and without table-map.

Workaround: Configure a service policy which does not have the combination of police action with table-map and without table-map.

* CSCud17934

Symptoms: PW redundancy on the Cisco 7600 does not work when the primary VC goes down and the backup VC takes over, and CE to CE communication is broken.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The MPLS facing LC is WS-X6704-10GE.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The CE facing LC is ES+.

Workaround: Use another HW on the MPLS core.

* CSCud19230

Symptoms: ES+ line card reload occurs with the following error messages:

%PM\_SCP-SP-1-LCP\_FW\_ERR: System resetting module 2 to recover from error:

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the ES+ line card.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud19257

Symptoms: NAT CLIs expose the vrf keyword on the Cisco 7600, which is not supported.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a NAT configuration.

Workaround: Do not use the vrf keyword for NATing on the Cisco 7600.

* CSCud22601

Symptoms: MPLS-TP tunnels stay down.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the standby boots up after the TP configuration is done and SSO is performed. This issue is seen once in 100 iterations.

Workaround: Shut/no shut the MPLS-TP tunnel. A nonintrusive workaround is to flap the protect LSP (by reconfiguring or by physical interface flap).

* CSCud24084

Symptoms: Performing a default MDT toggling on a VRF results in the encapsulation tunnel adjacency’s MTU being set to a lower MTU.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7S (Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S) and later releases when the mdt default <> is toggled on a VRF.

Workaround: Delete and add the affected VRF.

Further Problem Description: Software adjacency does not updated with the correct MTU.

* CSCud26339

Symptoms: Changing policy-map parameters triggers a Cisco IOSd crash.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the policy-map is attached to a service instance on the Cisco ASR 903.

Workaround: Remove the policy-map from the target and then make the changes.

* CSCud31012

Symptoms: MVPNv6 does not work in the Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7S image.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only with the IP services image.

Workaround: Use the enterprise image.

* CSCud33028

Symptoms: Segmentation crash occurs.

Conditions: This symptom occurs upon executing “config replace”.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud38004

Symptoms: RPF failure is not supported for EFP/EVC BD. As a result, multicast traffic is not forwarded.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in the following scenario:

Source------N1------N2

 \ /

 \ /

 Switch

* CSCtx31177

Symptoms: RP crash is observed on avl search.

Conditions: This crash is observed on configuration of rich system with high load. Sometimes the crash is happening when system is not being used.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

### Resolved Caveats—Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1

Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1 is a rebuild release for Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S. The caveats in this section are resolved in Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1 but may be open in previous Cisco IOS releases.

* CSCsq83006

Symptoms: When some port-channels go down at the same time on a router, it can cause EIGRP SIA errors.

Conditions: The symptom occurs with full mesh four routers which are connected via port-channels. Additionally, it occurs with over five routers which are connected via a partial mesh port-channel.

Workaround: Use the port-channel interface settings below:

 `(config)# interface port-channel <port-channel interface number>`

 `(config-if)# bandwidth <bandwidth value>`

 `(config-if)# delay <delay value>`

Further Problem Description: If a test is done with a physical interface, not a port-channel, this issue is not seen.

* CSCtg47129

The Cisco IOS Software implementation of the virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) aware network address translation (NAT) feature contains a vulnerability when translating IP packets that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.

* CSCti62247

Symptoms: If a packet is sent to a null interface, a Cisco ASR 1000 router will not respond with an ICMP packet.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when a prefix is routed to Null0 interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCto87436

Symptoms: A Cisco device that is running Cisco IOS may crash due to a watchdog timeout with the following error messages:

 `%SYS-3-CPUHOG: Task is running for (126004)msecs, more than (2000)msecs`

 `(30/1),process = SSH Process.`

 `-Traceback= 0x63D827CCz 0x6496A670z 0x649774CCz 0x649776A0z 0x6497777Cz`

 `0x6496BCFCz 0x6496BEA4z 0x6496BFF8z 0x61E122A0z 0x61DFC6CCz 0x61DFCF94z`

 `0x61DFF270z 0x61DFC5F8z 0x61E980E0z 0x61E984ACz 0x61E3DF6Cz`

 `%SYS-3-CPUHOG: Task is running for (128004)msecs, more than (2000)msecs`

 `(31/1),process = SSH Process.`

 `-Traceback= 0x63D7AA5Cz 0x62A47F68z 0x62A48500z 0x62A45F9Cz 0x649774E8z`

 `0x649776A0z 0x6497777Cz 0x6496BCFCz 0x6496BEA4z 0x6496BFF8z 0x61E122A0z`

 `0x61DFC6CCz 0x61DFCF94z 0x61DFF270z 0x61DFC5F8z 0x61E980E0z`

 `%SYS-2-WATCHDOG: Process aborted on watchdog timeout, process = SSH Process.`

Reason for the crash is that we are not handling the error condition properly in the call flow.

Conditions: This symptom occurs mainly due to slow response from the client. This can occur because of the below mentioned scenario. Condition that can leads to this:

Client is out of its window, and we expect window adjust message:

 1. Foreign reset happens to the connection.

 2. Idle timeout.

 3. Timer timeout.

 4. Other error to the connection.

We failed to handle this kind of error properly and we loop again and again expecting that message will come from the client even though we set the tcp->pid to No\_PROCESS.

Workaround: There is no workaround. Use a stable connection and use a noise free fast underlying physical connection between the two devices.

* CSCtq17444

Symptoms: A Cisco AS5400 crashes when performing a trunk call.

Conditions: The following conditions are observed:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Affected Cisco IOS Release: 15.1(3)T.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Affected platforms: routers acting as voice gateway for H.323.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtr45287

* CSCts54641

Symptoms: Various small, medium, or big VB chunk leaks are seen when polling EIGRP MIB or during SSO.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when MIBs are being polled or SSO is done.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtw88689

Symptoms: A crash is seen while applying the policy map with more than 16 classes with the Cisco 3900e platform.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when applying the policy map with more than 16 classes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx23593

Symptoms: Some virtual circuit (VC) information is missing in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) MIB object cAal5VccEntry from the output of the snmpwal command, but not in the router configuration command. For example, The ATM VCs 4/0.120 exist on the router but are missing in the MIB.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco 7204VXR (NPE-G2) router that is running Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE5 (c7200p-advipservicesk9-mz.122-33.SRE5.bin) image in the customer network. This issue may also occur in other releases.

This issue typically occurs over a period of time due to create/delete of subinterfaces. It also occurs if the customer uses the snmp ifmib ifIndex Persist command, which retains ifIndicies assigned to the @~@subinterfaces across router reload.

Workaround: There can be two workarounds where there is no fix present in the Cisco IOS code for this bug.

Workaround 1:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enter the  **show atm vc** privileged EXEC command on the same device to obtain a complete list of all the VCs. Or,

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do the SNMPWALK suffixing the ifIndex of the interface to get the value.

 `$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community> <ip address> 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2 | grep`

 `"4/0.120"`

 `IF-MIB::ifDescr.253 = STRING: ATM4/0.120-atm subif`

 `IF-MIB::ifDescr.254 = STRING: ATM4/0.120-aal5 layer`

 `$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community> <ip address> 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.66.1.1.1.1.3 |`

 `grep 9.9.66.1.1.1.1.3.254 ===> Got no entry of ifindex here in complete`

 `snmpwalk`

 `$`

 `$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c <community> <ip address> 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.66.1.1.1.1.3.254`

Doing the SNMPWALK suffixing the ifindex and getting the value can be one workaround. SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.66.1.1.1.1.3.254.200.106 = Counter32: 403633041

Workaround 2:

 1. Under configuration mode: no snmp ifmib ifIndex Persist.

 2. On all the ATM main interfaces: no snmp ifindex persist.

 3. Save the configuration: copy running start.

 4. Reload the box: reload. Reapply the persist configurations.

 5. Configure in configuration mode: snmp ifmib ifIndex Persist.

 6. Under the ATM main interface: snmp ifindex persist.

After this workaround, the problem may reappear over a period of time, but chances are very less.

The workaround/fix which needs to be enabled where the code fix is present in the Cisco IOS code for this bug.

Since this will go over all the possible ifIndicies, it will take more CPU cycles, causing some delay. The below global CLI can be used to enable/disable the fix based on the need.

CLI: snmp-server enable traps atm snmp-walk-serial

* CSCtx54882

Symptoms: A Cisco router may crash due to Bus error crash at voip\_rtp\_is\_media\_service\_pak.

Conditions: This symptom has been observed on a Cisco router running Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M2.

Workaround: There is no known workaround.

* CSCtx80535

Symptoms: DHCP pool that is configured for ODAP assigns the same IP to multiple sessions.

Conditions: PPP users receive pool via Radius. The pool is defined on the Cisco 10000 series router to use ODAP. ODAP is receiving the subnets from Radius correctly, and assigns IPs to PPP sessions, but sometimes two users end up having the same IP address.

Workaround: Clear both sessions sharing the same IP.

* CSCtx89615

Symptoms: Classification on the switchport interface will not work on reload of the box.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when reloading the box.

Workaround: Remove the policy-map and apply it back.

* CSCty01237

Symptoms: The router logs show:

 `<timestamp> %OER_BR-5-NOTICE: Prefix Learning STARTED CMD: ’show run’ <timestamp>`

This is followed by the router crashing.

Conditions: This issue is seen under the following conditions:

 1. Configure PfR with a learn-list using a prefix-list as a filter and enable learn.

 2. Use a configuration tool, script or NMS that periodically executes show run on the MC over HTTP or some other means.

Workaround 1: If you use PfR learn-list feature, do not execute show run periodically.

Workaround 2: If you use a monitoring tool that executes show run periodically, avoid using a learn-list configuration in PfR.

* CSCty07558

Symptoms: DHCPv6 packets are dropped on a Cisco 7600 switch. For example, they are not flooded.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when there is no IPv6 address on an SVI or if l2 VLAN has SVI in shut state (default existence after a new ACL feature).

Workaround: Two possible workarounds which essentially serve as the fix due to the limitations they impose:

 1. When working with a pure L2 VLAN, remove ttl rate limiter (selected as default rate limiter on Cisco7600, but not on other boxes) using “no mls rate-limit all ttl-failure”.

 2. If the design permits and TTL rate limiter is necessary, put a dummy IPv6 address on the SVI or simply configure IPv6 enable on the SVI.

* CSCty12312

Symptoms: Multilink member links move to an up/down state and remain in this condition.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after multilink traffic stops flowing.

Workaround: Remove and restore the multilink configuration.

* CSCty30952

Symptoms: QoS policy-map gets rejected on shut/no shut of the interface or when the router reloads.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the router reloads or shut/no shut of the interface.

Workaround: Apply the policy-map back.

* CSCty35726

Symptoms: The following is displayed on the logs:

 `InterOp:Cube-NavTel : LTI: Video Xcode Call with plain Audio FAILS`

Conditions: This symptom is seen when video Xcode call with plain audio fails.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty41336

Symptoms: Forward-alarm ais does not work on CESoPSN circuits.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you create SAToP and CESoPSN circuits and configure "forward-alarm ais".

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty59891

Symptoms: On the node where shut/no shut is issued, traffic does not reach IPsec VSPA, which is supposed to get encrypted.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when issuing shut/no shut on the GRE tunnel protected with IPsec and QoS configured on this IPsec tunnel.

Workaround: Remove and attach “tunnel protection ipsec profile”.

* CSCty64216

Symptoms: On unconfiguring a scaled ACL, the router crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when an ACL having 1000 ACEs or more is unconfigured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty64255

Symptoms: BGP L3VPN dynamic route leaking feature from the VRF to global export feature, the prefix-limit is incorrect upon soft clear, or new prefix added, or prefix deleted.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when VRF to global export is enabled, and prefix-limit is configured.

Workaround: BGP hard clear.

* CSCty65189

Symptoms: Incoming register packets are dropped at the RP when zone-based firewall (ZBFW) is configured on the RP.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when ZBFW is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty79284

Symptoms: Source connected to dual home node is not forwarded to receivers in PIM SSM mode. The issue was due to the PIM joins not reaching the source node.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with dual home node with PIM SSM with traffic source.

Workaround: Add static group to forward the traffic to next hop router.

* CSCty80541

Symptoms: Having EVC BD, with split-horizon group as 0 or 2 as CE-facing, drops the traffic over VPLS core pseudowire (split-horizon enabled).

Conditions: This symptom is observed when CE-facing interface is EVC BD with split-horizon group as 0 or 2. For split-horizon group 1, traffic flows fine. The issue with CE-facing as group 0, cannot be fixed because of hardware limitation.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty86039

Symptoms: Shut down the physical interface of tunnel source interface. The router crashes with traffic going through some of the tunnels.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with tunnel interface with QoS policy installed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty89224

Symptoms: A Cisco IOS router may crash under certain circumstances when receiving a mvpnv6 update.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when receiving mvpnv6 update.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 6.8/5.6:  https://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvssCalculator.do?dispatch=1&version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C CVE ID CVE-2012-3895 has been assigned to document this issue.

* CSCtz00430

Symptoms: The static route is removed from the routing table.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when pulling out and replacing a connection to the management interface.

Workaround 1: Default the management interface and reconfigure IP.

Workaround 2: Do a shut and no shut on the management interface through the CLI.

* CSCtz07419

Symptoms: The PTP session is PHASE\_ALIGNED for a day, and then the PTP master crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is seen during longevity run.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz12525

Symptoms: Accounting stop is sent without Acct-Input-Packets Acct-Output-Packets Acct-Input-Octets Acct-Output-Octets when service stop is performed.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when service stop is issued for the prepaid service.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz16798

Symptoms: On configuring “ip pim snooping” on a L3 MCAST box, crash is observed.

Conditions: This symptom when L2 specific functionality is enabled on a L3 box. This is more of an unsupported and undesired configuration as the L3 box is capable of building the MCAST database on its own.

Workaround: Do not configure “ip pim snooping” on L3 Cisco ME 3600X and ME 3800X boxes.

* CSCtz17977

Symptoms: Not able to ping HSRP VIP address over Routed VPLS.

Conditions: This is seen when two Cisco ME 3600s (me360x-universalk9-mz.152-2.S.bin) are connected together via VPLS. The Cisco ME 3600X-1 is configured with HSRP under VLAN50, and the R1 is able to ping. The R2 and Cisco ME 3600X-2 are not able to ping the VIP (HSRP) address. The R2 and Cisco ME 3600X-2 are able to ping physically the IP address of R1 and the Cisco ME 3600X-1. We do have ARP entry for the VIP address on all routers.

-----VPLS--------- R1(fa0/1)--------Vlan50 ME3600X-1-0/2--------Ten-------0/2- ME3600X-2-Vlan50-- -----fa0/1-R2

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz26683

Symptoms: An unsupported “ip verify unicast...” configuration applied to an interface may still be shown in show running-config after being rejected. Output similar to the following will appear when applying the configuration:

 `% ip verify configuration not supported on interface Tu100`

 `- verification not supported by hardware`

 `% ip verify configuration not supported on interface Tu100`

 `- verification not supported by hardware`

 `%Restoring the original configuration failed on Tunnel100 - Interface Support`

 `Failure`

Conditions: This occurs when there is no prior “ip verify unicast...” configuration on the interface and when the interface and/or platform do not support the given RPF configuration.

Workaround: In some cases it may be possible to get back to the previous configuration by using a no form of the command. In other cases, it will be necessary to reload the device without saving the configuration, or editing the configuration manually if already saved.

* CSCtz37164

Symptoms: The requests to the RADIUS server are retransmitted even though the session no longer exists, causing unnecessary traffic to RADIUS, and RADIUS getting requests for an invalid session.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the RADIUS server is unreachable and the CPE times out the session.

Workaround: The fix is currently being worked upon. This issue can be seen as per the conditions mentioned above. This issue can be avoided by making sure that the RADIUS server is always reachable.

* CSCtz43626

Symptoms: Minor or major temperature alarms reported in the syslog:

 `%C7600_ENV-SP-4-MINORTEMPALARM: module 2 aux-1 temperature crossed threshold #1(=60C). It has exceeded normal operating temperature range.`

 `%C7600_ENV-SP-4-MINORTEMPALARM: EARL 2/0 outlet temperature crossed threshold #1(=60C). It has exceeded normal operating temperature range.`

Conditions: This symptom is observed on ES+ series line cards of Cisco 7600 series routers. Specifically, reported temperature will be far off from reading of other sensors on the line card.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Further Problem Description: This is en enhancement in temperature reading on ES+ line cards of Cisco 7600 series routers. Reading of any temperature sensor is compared to its adjacent sensors. If the reading deviates too much from adjacent sensors, this reading is ignored. This enhancement is eliminating the single point of failure, by which one faulty sensor can trigger an environmental alarm. Nature of heat dissipation and the number and placement of temperature sensors on ES+ line cards allow for such logic to be introduced.

* CSCtz44989

Symptoms: A EIGRP IPv6 route redistributed to BGP VRF green is not exported to VRF RED. Extranet case is broken for IPv6 redistributed routes.

Conditions: The issue is seen with IPv6 link-local nexthop. When the EIGRP route is redistributed to BGP VRF, it clears the nexthop information (it become 0.0.0.0). Now this route becomes invalid and BGP is not able to export to another VRF.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz48338

Symptoms: A router may crash with setup with configuration of BGP L3VPN VRF to global export, NSR, and large scale, hard clear or link flap.

Conditions: This symptom is seen under the following conditions:

 1. BGP L3VPN VRF to global import

 2. NSR

 3. Large scale

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz50204

Symptoms: A crash is observed on EzVPN Server if VRF configuration under the ISAKMP profile is modified.

Conditions: The crash is observed only if there are active sessions at the time of configuration change.

Workaround: Prior to applying a configuration change, clear the sessions.

* CSCtz58941

Symptoms: The router crashes when users execute the show ip route XXXX command.

Conditions: This symptom is observed during the display of the show ip route XXXX, when the next-hops of “XXXX” networks are removed.

Workaround: The show ip route XXXX command (without “XXXX”) does not have the problem.

* CSCtz61556

Symptoms: ATM local switching segments do not come up after changing encap on both interfaces.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with ATM VC local switching. If the encap on both the ATM VC segments are changed, the segments remain in DOWN state.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz71084

Symptoms: When the prefix from CE is lost, the related route that was advertised as best-external to RR by PE does not get withdrawn. Even though the BGP table gets updated correctly at PE, RIB still has a stale route.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a topology like shown below, where CE0 and CE1 advertise the same prefixes:

CE0------------------PE0---------------------RR | | | | CE1------------------PE1----------------------|

Best-external is configured at PEs. PE0 prefers the path via PE1 and chooses it as its best path and advertises its eBGP path as the best-external path to RR. RR has two routes to reach the prefix, one via PE0 and the other via PE1. This issue occurs when CE0 loses the route; therefore, PE0 loses its best-external path and it has to withdraw, but this does not happen.

This issue does not occur if the interface between PE0-CE0 is shut from either side. Instead, the following command should be issued to stop CE0 from advertising the prefix: no network x.x.x.x mask y.y.y.y

Even though the trigger has SOO, it is not necessary for the repro. This same issue can be observed by PIC (stale backup path at RIB under the similar scenario), diverse-path, and inter-cluster best-external, and is day 1 issue with all.

Workaround: Hard clear.

* CSCtz83221

Symptoms: Active or standby route processor crashes.

Conditions: This symptom can be seen during the configuration or removal of ATM virtual circuits.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz92606

Symptoms: MFR memberlinks-T1 serial interfaces created under a CHOC12 controller, do not get decoupled from MFR even after the MFR bundle interface is deleted. Once the MFR bundle interface is reconfigured, the memberlinks do not appear under it.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with MFR with memberlinks as T1 serials from CHOC12 sonet controller.

Workaround: Unconfigure and reconfigure the “encap frame-relay MFRx” under each memberlink after reconfiguring the MFR bundle interface.

* CSCtz94902

Symptoms: Memory allocation failure is seen when attaching to SIP-40 using a web browser.

Conditions: This symptom is seen on the line card with a memory allocation failure.

Workaround: Reset the line card.

* CSCtz96504

Symptoms: Some of the backup VCs are down after SSO.

Conditions: This symptom happens only on scale scenario where 500 primary and 500 backup VCs were created.

Workaround: These backup VCs can be brought to SB state by issuing the  **clear xconnect peerid**  p *eerid of the PW*  **vcid**  *vcid* command. Although it is not usually recommended, it is the only way to recover.

* CSCua06598

Symptoms: Router may crash with breakpoint exception.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when SNMP polls IPv6 MIB inetCidrRouteEntry and there is a locally-sourced BGP route installed in IPv6 RIB.

Workaround: Disable SNMP IPv6 polling.

* CSCua06629

Symptoms: The sh ipv6 mobile pmipv6 mag global command does not show any output.

Conditions: The symptom is observed only when domain and MAG configurations are present.

Workaround: If MAG configuration is complete (all requisite access interfaces and peers are configured) then this issue will not be seen.

* CSCua07791

Symptoms: A Cisco ISR G2 running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)T or later shows a memory leak in the CCSIP\_SPI\_CONTRO process.

Conditions: The leak is apparent after 3-4 weeks. The process is CCSIP\_SPI\_CONTRO.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua07927

Symptoms: MLDP traffic is dropped for local receivers on a bud node.

Conditions: This issue is seen on doing stateful switchover (SSO) on bud node.

Workaround: Using the clear ip mroute vrf vrf name \* command for the effected VRFs will resume the MLDP traffic.

* CSCua13418

Symptoms: RP-Announce packets are being replicated across all the tunnel interfaces and the count of replication is equal to the number of tunnel interfaces. For example, if there are 3 tunnel interfaces, then each tunnel should forward 1 RP-Announce packet each minute (with the default timer configured). However, in this case, each tunnel is forwarding 3 RP-Announce packets across each tunnel interface. This issue is not specific to the number of interfaces. It can happen with any number of tunnel interfaces.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when filter-autorp is configured with the ip multicast boundary command. This issue is seen on the Cisco 3725 router too, where the incoming packets are being replicated because of the filter-autorp command.

Workaround: Removing filter-autorp resolves the issue. However, you need to remove the pim and boundary commands first and then reapply the pim and boundary list without the filter-autorp keyword. Also, doing this might lead to redesigning of the topology to meet specific requirements.

int Tun X no ip pim sparse-dense mode no ip multicast boundary XXXXXX filter-autorp

int TuX ip pim sparse-dense mode ip multicast boundary XXXXXX

* CSCua13561

Symptoms: After upgrading to Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S, users cannot get IP address via PPP IPCP from DHCP pool on a Cisco ASR router. There was no configuration change.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when upgrading to Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S.

Workaround: Remove the  **vpdn authen-before-forward** command.

* CSCua14594

Symptoms: Memory leak is seen when polling for the following PW MIBS:

 `1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.106.1.5.1.1 (cpwVcPerfTotalInHCPackets)`

 `1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.106.1.5.1.2 (cpwVcPerfTotalInHCBytes)`

 `1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.106.1.5.1.3 (cpwVcPerfTotalOutHCPackets)`

 `1.3.6.1.4.1.9.10.106.1.5.1.4 (cpwVcPerfTotalOutHCBytes)`

 `Address Size Alloc_pc PID Alloc-Proc Name`

 `34417B84 308 13774B30 473 SNMP ENGINE AToM VC event trace`

This memory leak, on repeated polling, may lead to device crash.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 3.6S upon polling of the SNMP VC statistics query.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua15292

Symptoms: Router may report unexpected exception with overnight stress traffic.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco ISR 3925E is deployed as DMVPN hub router and about 100Mbps traffic is controlled by PfR MC with dynamic PBR.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Router logs with

 `%CRYPTO-4-RECVD_PKT_INV_SPI: decaps: rec’d IPSEC packet has invalid spi for destaddr=172.8.9.8, prot=50, spi=0xE8FB045F(3908764767), srcaddr=10.0.100.1, input interface=GigabitEthernet0/0`

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua16492

Symptoms: Some IPv6 multi-hop BFD over BGP sessions flap.

Conditions: Occurs on port-channel interfaces running IPv6 multi-hop BFD over BGP sessions after you perform an SSO.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua19425

Symptoms: RP crashes at the far end, pointing to Watchdog Process BGP.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when doing an FP reload at the near end. This issue is seen with EBGP sessions with BFD configured between near end and far end routers.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua21166

Symptoms: Unable to form IPSec tunnels due to the following error:

 `RM-4-TUNNEL_LIMIT: Maximum tunnel limit of 225 reached for Crypto functionality with securityk9 technology package license.`

Conditions: Even though the router does not have 225 IPsec SA pairs, error will prevent IPSec from forming. Existing IPSec SAs will not be affected.

Workaround: Reboot to clear out the leaked counter, or install hsec9 which will disable CERM (Crypto Export Restrictions Manager).

PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 2.8/2.3:  <https://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvssCalculator.do?dispatch=1&version=2&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:M/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:U/RL:W/RC:C> No CVE ID has been assigned to this issue.

* CSCua25943

Symptoms: CPU Hog is observed on the LC when the number of IPv6 prefixes pumped in is more than 10,000.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when more than 10,000 IPv6 prefixes are pumped into the router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua26487

Symptoms: SNMP loops at OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.645.1.2.1.1.1, and as a result, SNMP walk fails.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only on the SNMP getbulk request on 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.645.1.2.1.1.1.

Workaround: Exclude the MIB table from SNMP walk using SNMP view. See the below configurations.

 `snmp-server view <view name> iso included
 snmp-server view <view name> ceeSubInterfaceTable excluded
 snmp-server community <community> view <view name>nterfaceTable excluded
 snmp-server community <community> view <view name>`

* CSCua27852

Symptoms: Traffic loss is seen in pure BGP NSR peering environment.

Conditions: The symptom is seen on a Cisco router that is running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S, and the BGP peerings to CEs and RR are all NSR enabled.

Workaround: Enable the bgp graceful-restart command for RR peering.

* CSCua28346

Symptoms: A router crashes during second rekey.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with IKEv2 with RSA authentication.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua30053

Symptoms: Authentication is failing for clients after some time because the radius\_send\_pkt fails, because it complains about the low IOMEM condition.

Conditions: In AAA, minimum IO memory must be 512KB to process the new request. If the memory is less than this, AAA does not process the new authentication request. This is AAA application threshold. This application barriers are not valid in dynamic memory case. Such conditions are removed for NG3K platform.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua31794

Symptoms: After reload with the debug image, framed E1 lines are down.

Conditions: On checking the “show controller SONET”, the default controller framing mode is taken as “crc4”. However before reload the configuration for those E1s were configured as “no-crc4”. Customer configured them on the E1s as “no-crc4” and it started working fine and the “show controller SONET” framing output changed to “no-crc4”. As per running configuration still the configuration is not showing “no-crc4”, as it should show as the default is CRC4. So the current issue is configuring “no-crc4”, it is not showing in running configuration and not saved and after reload it shows again CRC4 and services go down again.

Workaround: Configure E1s as “no-crc4” and they would be working fine, but such changes are not being saved in configuration, so if reload reoccurs all these services go down again.

* CSCua31903

Symptoms: IPv6 traffic is forwarded to wrong VRF when address is the same on both VRFs.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in an IPv6 MPLS VPN network that has PE routers, which have multiple CE routers connected. The CE routers are in different IPv6 VRFs. The CE routers have the same IPv6 address. The PE routers are dual and use dual stack. The problem happens on a 6VPE setup when the CEs share same the IP address.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua33287

Symptoms: ES+: L2TPv3 entries are programmed incorrectly after restart.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when some L2TPv3 sessions are established on ES+ module. After the restart of ES+, some np entries may not program correctly. As the result, ES+ will stop to transmit packets.

This condition will recover after executing shut/no shut on physical interfaces.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua33527

Symptoms: Traceback seen after second or third switchover:

 `%LFD-SW2-3-SMBADEVENT: Unexpected event CO_WAIT_TIMEOUT for state RUNNING -Traceback= 7908E9Cz 7909848z 79099CCz 7909B9Cz 78DBF20z 523292Cz 522C1D4z`

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a quad-sup scenario/setup. This traceback is seen on the new active RP after second switchover onwards.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua33821

Symptoms: CPU utilization shoots up to 99% after configuring crypto maps.

Conditions: The symptom is observed after applying crypto maps.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua34033

Symptoms: A Cisco ME 3800X hangs after boot.

Conditions: It is possible for an evaluation scaled license to be configured on the router and scaled services license configured. EULA acceptance can be ignored when configuring this. When the Cisco ME 3800X is rebooted, the router needs to program itself differently for a scaled license than a base license, but it cannot do so without the EULA being accepted so the router issues a prompt on the console port. The router will wait here until a user has responded. However, if a user is not on the console port to see this EULA message, they will not know that it is waiting for an EULA response. The router will continue to wait.

This is not seen on purchased licenses as they are not installed unless the EULA is accepted.

Workaround: When using evaluation licenses, accept the EULA upon configuring a license on the router or only reload the router from a connection to the console port after configuring the router to use an evaluation license.

* CSCua34638

Symptoms: A crash is seen on RP2, when the show platform software shell command package command is issued.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the show platform software shell command package command is issued. It impacts the RP2 (x86\_64\_\*) image only.

* CSCua39107

Symptoms: In a FlexVPN Spoke to Spoke setup, Resolution reply goes via the Tunnel interface to the Hub.

Conditions: This symptom is only observed when NHO is added for the V-Access, overriding an existing route. This issue is not seen when H route is added.

Workaround: Distribute the summarized address from the Hub, thus avoiding addition of NHO at the Spokes. The Spokes will then add H route instead of NHO.

* CSCua40273

Symptoms: The ASR1k crashes when displaying MPLS VPN MIB information.

Conditions: Occurs on the ASR1K with version 15.1(02)S software.

Workaround: Avoid changing the VRF while querying for MIB information.

* CSCua43930

Symptoms: Checksum value parsed from GRE header is not populating causing the GRE tunnel checksum test case to fail.

Conditions: The issue is seen on a Cisco ISR G2.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua45114

Symptoms: Default sessions will not establish when you apply VRF as a service to the default policy. VRF can only be applied to a default session by assigning a VRF on the access-interface. However with dedicated sessions, one cannot apply a VRF on the access-interface and VRF transfer at the same time. If we require VRF transfer on dedicated sessions, we need VRF transfer on lite sessions as well.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when access-side interface is in the default VRF. VRF is applied as a service to the default policy.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua45122

Symptoms: Multicast even log preallocated memory space needs to be conserved on the low-end platform.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with multicast even log.

* CSCua48807

Symptoms: Complete traffic loss is observed.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when queue-limit and default WRED “random-detect” are configured in a class and dynamically modify queue- limit of that class.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua51991

Symptoms: An invalid SPI message is seen throughout the lifetime of IPsec SA.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with SVTI-SVTI with a GRE IPv6 configuration. When bringing up 1K sessions, an invalid SPI is seen. There is also inconsistency between the number of child SAs in IKEv2 and the number of IPsec SAs on the same box.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua52289

Symptoms: CPU hog is seen on the line card due to Const2 IPv6 process.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with 4 core facing tunnels. Upon FRR cutover, the CPU hog is observed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua52977

Symptoms: DHCPv6 solicitations are sent over the air. This should be filtered, as it is normally client->network and not a flood type of traffic.

Conditions: This symptom applies to any network with clients using IPv6.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua53772

Symptoms: Router crashes when scheduling a y1731 DMM IP SLA probe to run.

Conditions: This symptom happens when the probe’s target cfm mep is configured under service instance with double tag encapsulation.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua55539

Symptoms: CE devices ping is failing on SAToP/CESoPSN.

Conditions: This issue is observed only with ECMP at the core.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua55691

Symptoms: A Cisco IOS memory leak is observed.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when unconfiguring/reconfiguring BGP AD VFIs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Further Problem Description: This issue is seen during longevity run.

* CSCua56802

Symptoms: QoS will not work on one of the subinterfaces/EVC.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when HQoS policy is configured on more than one subinterface/EVC on ES+ and then add flat SG on them.

Workaround: Remove and reapply SG.

* CSCua57728

Symptoms: Traffic loss of ~25s is seen upon doing TE FRR Cutover with IPv6 prefixes.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with four core facing tunnels, and 100,000 IPv6 prefixes. Shut the primary interface and check for the traffic loss.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua58100

Symptoms: The syslog is flooded with the following traceback message:

 `%SYS-2-NOTQ: unqueue didn't find 7F3D26BDCCD8 in queue`

 `7F3CA5E4A240 -Process= "RADIUS Proxy", ipl= 0, pid= 223`

 `-Traceback= 1#e0ee0ce60492fdd11f0b03e0f09dc812 :400000+873623 :400000+2547652`

Conditions: Occurs under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You establish 36k EAPSIM sessions using a RADIUS client on server A.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You establish 36k roaming sessions using a RADIUS client on server B.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The roaming sessions have the same caller-station-id but use a different IP address than the EAPSIM sessions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua60395

Symptoms: When an IPv6 packet is received via EoMPLS pseudowire, the packet is punted to the CPU and sent back on the pseudowire.

Conditions: This has been identified on a Cisco ME3600X with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)S1.

Workaround:

Option 1: Configure the xconnect under a interface vlan and configure a (dummy) IP address. Example:

 interface vlan XXX

 ip address A.B.C.D M.M.M.M

 xconnect N.N.NN <vc-id> encapsulation mpls

Option 2: Block IPv6 packets on remote end so that these packets are not sent over pseudowire.

* CSCua64546

Symptoms: In a scaled setup with IPV4 and IPV6 ACL together (not necessarily on the same interface), IPV4 ACLs may stop working if the IPV6 ACL configured later overwrites the IPv4 ACL results and vice versa.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with IPV4 and IPV6 ACLs configured on the box.

Workaround: There is no perfect workaround. Reconfiguring the IPV4 ACL can recover the functionality but will affect the IPV6 ACL.

Further Problem Description: Only the IPV4 or IPV6 ACL configuration will work.

* CSCua64700

Symptoms: The IPsec tunnel state goes to Up-Idle after 4-5 days of the router being up and running.

Conditions: This symptom is observed if you have low rekey value, as with the rekey, the new SPI gets allocated. This issue is seen with WS-IPSEC-3 and to verify this, check the below counter.

 `show crypto ace spi`

If there is no decrement in the SPI allocated counter and there is a consistent increment in the counter, the chances are high that you will encounter this issue.

Once the value reaches 61439, you will encounter this issue.

 `MTCVPNK03#sh cry ace spi`

 `SPI in use........................... 0`

 `Normal SPI allocated................. 61439`

Workaround: There is no workaround. You need to reload the box.

* CSCua67532

Symptoms: IPsec sessions fail to come up.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when Site-Site crypto configuration using crypto map is applied on SVI, and when no ISAKMP profile is configured under that crypto map.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua67795

Symptoms: The router does not transmit Y.1731 Delay Measurement Message (DMM) values using QinQ encapsulation.

Conditions: Occurs with the following configuration:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) An EFP is configured and applied to a bridge-domain.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The EFP is configured with QinQ encapsulation.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A Y.1731 Delay Measurement Message (DMM) value is applied.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The Y.1731 traffic uses a CoS value other than 0.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua67998

Symptoms: System crashes.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after adding or removing a policy-map to a scaled GRE tunnel configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua68243

Symptoms: IGMP and PIM control packets are not reaching RP. As a result, mac-address table for IGMP snooping entries is not populated.

Conditions: This symptom can be seen on a Cisco 7600 series router that is running Cisco IOS where we have IGMP and PIM control packets coming in on an SVI only after the condition where the SVI link state went down and came up again. This does not affect routed ports.

Workaround: Unconfigure and reconfigure the SVI.

* CSCua69657

Symptoms: Traceback is seen when executing the show clock detail command.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when executing the show clock detail command with Cisco IOS interim Release 15.3(0.4)T image.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua70065

Symptoms: CUBE reloads on testing DO-EO secure video call over CUBE when SDP passthru is enabled.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when running Cisco IOS interim Release 15.3(0.4)T.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua71038

Symptoms: Router crash.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a Cisco router that is running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(3)T1. The router may crash during the failover test with OCSP and CRL configured.

Workaround: Configure OCSP or CRL but not both

* CSCua72199

Symptoms: Unsolicited RAs from the switch is forwarded as mcast RAs over the air to the wireless clients. It should be a unicast packet. CAPWAP packet header from the switch is populated with L2 MGID and not IPv6 RA MGID (L3) and forwarded as multicast over air.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with Standalone Newton 48 with a couple of APs and a couple of wireless clients with IPv6 enabled. IPv6 unicast routing is enabled on the switch.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua72440

Symptoms: The REP VLAN load balancing does not happen correctly when two REP edge no-neighbor ports are configured. Traffic does not flow as expected.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S image that is loaded on a Cisco 7600 box. Two REP edge no-neighbor ports along with VLAN Load balancing are configured. The correct VLANs are not blocked/opened on the respective ports.

* CSCua78782

Symptoms: Authentication of EzVPN fails.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with BR-->ISP-->HQ.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua80204

Symptoms: EoMPLS remote port shutdown feature does not work.

Conditions: This symptom is observed if xconnect and a service instance are configured under the same interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua83609

Symptoms: With 10 VRFs, traffic is forwarded through data and default-mdt address. The PEs are connected in a serial fashion, and total number of PEs is over 200. After the number of PEs becomes more than 50, the CPU usage goes high as a result of both software and hardware switching of mVPN control packets like Data-MDT.

Conditions: This issue has been seen under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco ME 3600X is running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S but is not release specific.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Multicast stream can be received on any type of interface (L2/L3).

Traffic is stopped as the CPU hog/crash is seen. Issue can be verified via the following:

“show processes cpu sorted | e 00”

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua84879

Symptoms: Crash at slaVideoOperationPrint\_ios.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when IPSLA video operations are configured and show running-config is issued.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua84923

Symptoms: Following a misconfiguration on a two-level hierarchical policy with a user-defied queue-limit on a child policy, the UUT fails to attach the QoS policy on the interface even when corrected queueing features are used.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. The issue must have the user-defined queue-limit defined.

 2. This error recovery defected is confirmed as a side effect with the c3pl cnh compoent project due to ppcp/cce infrastructure enhancement.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua85837

Symptoms: Depending on the aces in the redirect-list ACL used, only a subnet of the traffic gets redirected based on ports.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the WCCP service has a redirect-list ACL applied which in turn has port-specific aces in them.

Workaround: Remove the L4 operators from the redirect-list ACL.

* CSCua85934

Symptoms: A session provisioning failure is seen in the ISG-SCE interface. The deactivate or disconnect request has the message authenticator wrongly calculated.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the ISG-SCE interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua86310

Symptoms: When relay is configured with unnumbered interface, it appears the packet is sent out of the loopback interface (instead of the serial interface) to the server, which does not receive the packet.

Conditions: The issue happens only when unnumbered loopback address is used on the relay interface which connects to server. If an IPv6 address is used directly on the interface, it works fine.

Workaround: Use numbered interface instead of unnumbered interface.

* CSCua87944

Symptoms: In an IPv6 snooping policy, the keyword “prefix-list” has no effect on control packet. The keyword only affects the binding table recovery. In an “ipv6 nd raguard” policy, the limited-broadcast keyword appears though it is deprecated. It should be hidden and is always on.

Conditions: These symptoms are observed in an IPv6 snooping policy and IPv6 and RA-guard policy.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua88341

Symptoms: Multicast traffic on P2P GRE tunnel will get dropped.

Conditions: This symptom usually happens in scenarios like SSO, which is done after VRF deletion or addition. Here the P2P GRE tunnel will be in the VRF.

Workaround: Do a shut/no shut of the P2P GRE tunnel interface.

* CSCua91104

Symptoms: ISIS adjacency process shows traceback messaging related to managed timer.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when configuring isis network point-to-point on LAN interface with isis bfd or isis ipv6 bfd enabled. The traceback does not happen always. It depends on timing.

Workaround: Disable isis bfd or isis ipv6 bfd before issuing isis network point-to-point command. Restore isis bfd or isis ipv6 bfd configuration on LAN interface.

* CSCua93136

Symptoms: The switch crashes when sending the DHCPv6 packet with “ipv6 snooping” on VLAN configurations.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when sending the DHCPv6 packet with “ipv6 snooping” configured on VLAN configurations.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua94947

Symptoms: RP crashes when downloading FreeRadius Framed-IPv6-Route on MLPPP sessions.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when downloading radius Framed-IPv6-Route.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua98690

Symptoms: The ES+/ES20/SIP-400 (any card which supports EVC) card may crash due to memory corruption.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the MAC ACL is configured on EFP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua98902

Symptoms: FIBIDB is not getting initialized.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when LFA FRR is configured Cisco ME 3800X.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub07382

Symptoms: NHRP cache entry for the spokes gets deleted on NHRP timer expiry even though there is traffic flowing through the spoke to spoke tunnel.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with FlexVPN spoke to spoke setup.

Workaround: Configure the same hold time on both tunnel interface and the virtual-template interface.

* CSCub07673

Symptoms: IPsec session does not come up for spa-ipsec-2g if ws-ipsec3 is also present. “Volume rekey” is disabled on Zamboni.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if we have “volume rekey” disabled on Zamboni.

Workaround: Do not disable the volume rekey on Zamboni.

* CSCub09124

Symptoms: MDT tunnel is down.

Conditions: This symptom is seen in MVPN. If the ip multicast boundary command on non-current RPF interface blocks the MDT group, it may cause MDT tunnel failure.

Workaround: Adding the static join command under PE loopback interface may work around the problem temporarily.

* CSCub10951

Symptoms: At RR, for an inter-cluster BE case, there are missing updates.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. The following configuration exists at all RRs that are fully meshed: - bgp additional-paths select best-external - nei x advertise best-external

 2. For example, RR5 is the UUT. At UUT, there is:

- Overall best path via RR1.

- Best-external (best-internal) path via PE6 (client of RR5): for example, the path is called “ic\_path\_rr5”.

- Initially, RR5 advertises “ic\_path\_rr5” to its nonclient iBGP peers, that is, RR1 and RR3.

 3. At PE6, unconfigure the route so that RR5 no longer has any inter-cluster BE path. RR5 sends the withdrawals to RR1 and RR3 correctly.

 4. At PE6, reconfigure the route so that RR5 will have “ic\_path\_rr5” as its “best-external (internal) path”. At this point, even though the BGP table at RR5 gets updated correctly, it does not send the updates to RR1 and RR3. They never relearn the route.

Workaround: Hard/soft clear.

* CSCub15542

Symptoms: Configuring mpls lsp trace results in IOSD restart.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when configuring mpls lsp trace results in IOSD restart.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub17985

Symptoms: A memory leak is seen when IPv6 routes are applied on the per-user sessions.

Conditions: This symptom is seen if IPv6 routes are downloaded as a part of the subscriber profile. On applying these routes to the sessions, a memory leak is observed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub18997

Symptoms: A Cisco ME 3800 may crash after the following error message is displayed:

 `%SYS-6-STACKLOW: Stack for process Non-Qos Events Process running low, 0/6000`

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco ME 3800 that is running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub24079

Symptoms: TAR bundle does not get downloaded through the archive command.

Conditions: This symptom applies to any conditions.

Workaround: Untar externally and copy to flash/ucode1 directories.

* CSCub25360

Symptoms: In a Flexlink switchover scenario, it seems that for some reason, the Cisco ME 3600X switch does not send out a dummy mcast packet for the SVI.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a Cisco ME 3600X Flexlink switchover.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub31592

Symptoms: After the flap of the interface with EVC configured, the box is no longer adding second tag to the traffic. Forwarding is broken. See the following example:

 `service instance 100 ethernet`

 `encapsulation dot1q 10`

 `bridge-domain 100`

Conditions: This symptom is seen with flap of the interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub31622

Symptoms: RSTP BPDUs are not tunneled over xconnect.

Conditions: This has been observed on Cisco IOS Releases 15.1(02)EY02a, 15.1(02)EY3 and 15.2(2)S1 with below configuration on the Cisco ME3800X:

 `int gix/x`

 `l2protocol tunnel`

 `bridge-domain 500`

 `int vlan 500`

 `platform rewrite imposition tag push 1 symmetric`

 `xconnect x.x.x.x 500 encapsulation mpls`

This may create STP inconsistency and blocked VLANs on CE side.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub31902

Symptoms: Alignment correction tracebacks are seen from within the diag\_dump\_lc\_l2\_table() cosmetic issue, which create temporary memory inconsistencies in the function.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in normal conditions, during bootup time, provided testMacNotification fails.

Workaround: Disable bootup diagnostics or disable the testMacNotification health monitoring test.

* CSCub32500

Symptoms: Router crashes in EIGRP due to chunk corruption.

Conditions: This symptom is seen on EIGRP flaps.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub33877

Symptoms: During the “issue loadversion” where we are downgrading from Texel (or later) to Yap (v151\_1\_sg\_throttle or earlier), the standby RP keeps reloading due to the out of the sync of configuration.

Conditions: The issue occurs during ISSU loadversion operation. The newer version of image supports the IPv6 multicast while the older version of image does not.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub35388

Symptoms: The  **port-channel min-links** command is rejected under port-channel.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when port-channel has vrf configuration.

Workaround: first configure min-link command and then configure vrf command under port-channel

* CSCub36217

Symptoms: When the Cisco ME 3800 router is running Cisco IOS Release15.2(4)S software, if EVC maximum MAC security address limit is reached for a service instance, new MAC address is not rejected.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when EVC MAC security is enabled under a service instance.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 1.7/1.3:  <https://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvssCalculator.do?dispatch=1&version=2&vector=AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C> No CVE ID has been assigned to this issue. Additional information on Cisco’s security vulnerability policy can be found at the following URL:  <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_vulnerability_policy.html>

* CSCub42920

Symptoms: KS rejects rekey ACK from GM with message (from “debug crypto gdoi ks rekey all”):

 `GDOI:KS REKEY:ERR:(get:0):Hash comparison for rekey ack failed.`

The keys and policies in the rekey packet are correctly installed by the GM, but the rekey ACK does not get processed by the KS. This leads to rekey retransmissions, GM re-registration and potential disruption of communication.

Conditions: Rekey ACK validation in Cisco IOS Releases 15.2(4)M1 (ISR-G2) and 15.2(4)S/XE 3.7S (Cisco ASR1000) is incompatible with other software releases.

A KS that runs Cisco IOS Releases 15.2(4)M1 or 15.2(4)S/XE 3.7S will only be able to perform successful unicast rekeys with a GM that runs one of those two versions. Likewise, a KS that runs another version will only interoperate with a GM that also runs another version.

Workaround: Use multicast rekeys.

* CSCub46570

Symptoms: The image cannot be built with an undefined symbol.

Conditions: This symptom occurs as the commit error triggers the compiling issue.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub47520

Symptoms: “Match dscp default” matches router initiated ARP packets.

Conditions: This issue is seen on Cisco 7600 ES+ line cards.

Workaround: Classify router generated packets using source mac address using a MAC ACL.

* CSCub48262

Symptoms: Router crashes in ROMMON.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with RSP processor.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub49291

Symptoms: Static tunnels between hubs and spokes fail to rebuild.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when reloading hub on the DMVPN IPv6 setup with DPD on-demand enabled on all spokes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub54872

Symptoms: A /32 prefix applied to an interface (e.g. a loopback) is not being treated as connected. This can then prevent Half-Duplex VRFs from operating correctly.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when the prefix applied to an interface is for a host route (/32 for IPv4 or /128 for IPv6).

Workaround: Use a shorter prefix.

* CSCub62897

Symptoms: SVI is not coming up for a long time even though there are active ports in that VLAN.

Conditions: This issue happens with flexlink + preemption + VLAN load balance configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub67101

Symptoms: The POS interface line protocol is down with encapsulation PPP in an MPLS setup.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when configuring encapsulation PPP on both ends of PE1 and CE1, and then configuring xconnect in the customer-facing interface of PE1.

* CSCub98588

Symptoms: The IPsec session does not comes up for spa-ipsec-2g if you have “volume rekey” disabled.

Conditions: This symptom is seen if we have “volume rekey” disabled on spa-ipsec-2g.

Workaround: Do not disable the volume rekey on spa-ipsec-2g.

* CSCub99756

Symptoms: A Cisco ASR 1000 router that is running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S acting as a GM in a GETVPN deployment starts using the most recent IPSEC SA upon KS rekey instead of using the old key up to 30 seconds of expiration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only in Cisco IOS Release 15.2.(4)S.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc08298

Symptoms: ISSU between XE 3.7S base version (Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S) and Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S2 or later releases may not pass in the presence of trifecta modules.

Conditions: This issue is specific to setups with trifecta modules.

Workaround: In order to make ISSU work with (Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S) base release, power down the trifecta module using  **no power enable mod** t *rifecta slot(s)* and then carry out the ISSU procedure to releases later than Cisco IOS Release 15.2(04)S2.

* CSCuc11090

Symptoms: With Cisco ME3600/ME3800 as the encap box in MVPN, if the packet size if greater than the default MTU, packets will not flow out of the box.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with MVPN configured on Cisco ME3600/ME3800 box. The box should be a core encap box and traffic should be going on the tunnel to hit this situation. Only packets beyond the default MTU will not go out and get dropped.

Workaround: Send packets of smaller size from the source so that after encaping with the 24 bytes of outer IP of the MDT tunnel does not go beyond the size of egressing interface MTU.

* CSCuc13364

Symptoms: Egress service policy on EFP is dropping all traffic in egress. Offered rate equals drop rate. Interface output rate is zero, output drop is increasing.

Conditions: This issue has been observed with Cisco ME36xx that is running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc14023

Conditions: Under higher scale this problem becomes more noticeable.

Workaround: There is non known workaround at this time. We are still investigating the problem.

* CSCtq24011

Symptoms: Routers act like if local-proxy-arp is configured and does a proxy-arp even for the systems in the same subnet.

Conditions: The router receives arp request on an interface while the interface is not fully initialized. The connected routes are not added in the routing table yet. This causes proxy-arp reply and wrong arp entry stuck forever.

Workaround:  **shut/no shut** on victim and offender routers.

* CSCtq56659

Symptoms: Wrong LC programming with CEM interface.

Conditions: Issue is seen after the initial configuration of HSPWs.

Workaround: Soft OIR.

* CSCtr45030

Symptoms: The SNMP timers process causes the router to exit global configuration mode or prevents the console from entering global configuration mode.

  `c7609#conf t`

Configuration mode is locked by process “319” user “unknown” from terminal “0”. Please try later.

  `c7609#show proc | in 319`

 `319 Mwe 9735348 928 21701 42 4412/6000 0 SNMP Timers`

 Or

 `c7609(config)#logging console`

 Config session is locked by process “307”, user will be pushed back to exec mode. Command execution is locked, Please try later.

 `c7609(config)#^Z`

Conditions: Occurs when you copy and paste large configurations, particularly a large number of VLAN configurations. The issue occurs without any SNMP configurations present.

Workaround:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Option 1 - Disable RMON

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Option 2 - If configuration is huge. Paste in multiple blocks.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Option 3 - Enable debug snmp timers. Paste the required configuration when the timer callbacks have finished executing.

* CSCtr94565

Symptoms: Sp hung after the router crashes.

\_\_be\_snmp\_decode\_varbind

\_\_be\_mib\_tlv\_to\_oid

\_\_be\_mib\_tlv\_to\_octet

\_\_be\_snmp\_decode\_varbind

Conditions: MIBs are being polled or SSO is done.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtw94737

Symptoms: Standby supervisor keeps getting power-cycled due to RF request:

 `%OIR-SP-3-PWRCYCLE: Card in module 6, is being power-cycled (RF request)`

Conditions: Symptom is observed during RPR downgrade from Cisco IOS 15S to Cisco IOS Release 12.2SRE.

Workaround: Perform downgrade through reload.

* CSCtx15799

Symptoms: An MTP on a Cisco ASR router sends an “ORC ACK” message through CRC for the channel ID that is just received but does not reply to the ORC for the next channel.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when there is a very short time lapse between the ORC and CRC, say 1 msec.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx23593

Symptoms: Some virtual circuit (VC) information is missing in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) MIB object cAal5VccEntry from the output of the snmpwalk router configuration command. For example, The ATM VCs 4/0.120 exist on the router but are missing in the MIB.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a Cisco 7204VXR (NPE-G2) router that is running Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE5 (c7200p-advipservicesk9-mz.122-33.SRE5.bin) image in customer network. The symptom may also occur in other releases.

Workaround:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enter the show atm vc privileged EXEC command on the same device to obtain a complete list of all the VCs. Or,

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Do the SNMPWALK suffixing the ifIndex of the interface to get the value. $ snmpwalk -v 2c -c fwwrcmn na-salerno-ar011.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2 | grep "4/0.120" IF-MIB::ifDescr.253 = STRING: ATM4/0.120-atm subif IF-MIB::ifDescr.254 = STRING: ATM4/0.120-aal5 layer

 `$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c fwwrcmn na-salerno-ar011.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2 | grep "4/0.120"`

 `IF-MIB::ifDescr.253 = STRING: ATM4/0.120-atm subif`

 `IF-MIB::ifDescr.254 = STRING: ATM4/0.120-aal5 layer`

 `$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c fwwrcmn na-salerno-ar011.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.66.1.1.1.1.3 | grep 9.9.66.1.1.1.1.3.254 ===> Got no entry of ifindex here in complete snmpwalk`

 `$`

 `$ snmpwalk -v 2c -c fwwrcmn na-salerno-ar011.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.66.1.1.1.1.3.254 ===> When done the SNMPWALK suffixing the ifindex, then getting the value which can be one workaround.`

 `SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9.9.66.1.1.1.1.3.254.200.106 = Counter32: 403633041`

* CSCtx54882

Symptoms: A Cisco router may crash due to bus error crash at voip\_rtp\_is\_media\_service\_pak.

Conditions: This symptom is been observed on a Cisco router that is running Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M2.

Workaround: There is no known workaround.

* CSCtx59669

Symptoms: Spikes are observed in UDP jitter RTT values for MPLS VPN based operations.

Conditions: On a Cisco 7600 when there are a large number of packets configured per UDP operation, some packets (~1%) exhibit large RTT delays. This is especially noticeable when BGP is exchanging large number of routes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx72906

Symptoms: Standby gets stuck in cold-bulk state and it does not come up in SSO mode even after few hours.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with scale QoS configs applied on EVCs/subifs (L2VPN/L3VPN) and scale crypto configs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty09682

Symptoms: REP Primary edge fails to take part in REP.

Conditions: Occurs on reload.

Workaround: Flap the interface, and it will converge.

* CSCty10693

Symptoms: Device crashes with what looks like a memory corruption.

Conditions: Are not known at this time and will update as we have more information.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty22117

Symptoms: When swapping ip addresses on an ethernet connection between an MWR2941 and a Cisco 7600. OSPF fails to re-establish.

Conditions: Changing the IP address in the Cisco MWR2900 to the neighbors IP address and then changing the neighbors IP address to what was on the MWR causes the MWR to see a duplicate IP address and never allows the svi to participate in OSPF.

Tested changing the IP address in the other equipment first and this works fine. Only when the Cisco MWR2900 is changed first do we see this issue.

Workaround: “Change” the MWR address back to bad address:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) This causes duplicate address. OSPF timers again expire.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Now change back the MWR address to final IP address. We will not have the duplicate address this time, and the OSPF process completes to FULL.

* CSCty31982

Symptoms: Portchannel is in suspended state, with peer throwing messages that lacp is not enabled on remote node.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on reload.

Workaround: Remove/Add untagged service instance which would have l2peer stp,lacp configured.

* CSCty33037

Symptoms: Out of memory is seen on sender

Conditions: This symptom is observed on three Telepresence sessions running at the same time for maximum duration (10 minutes).

Workaround: There is no workaround. Reduce duration or session number.

* CSCty47447

Symptoms: IPv6 traffic over IPv6 sVTI tunnels gets dropped.

Conditions: This symptom is seen under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Have GRE+IPsec tunnels configured with QoS.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Have IPv4 sVTI tunnels configured with QoS.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Have IPv6 sVTI tunnels configured.

With all the above tunnels configured, traffic should flow on all the IPv4 IPsec and VTI tunnels and traffic rate should oversubscribe the QoS policy on them.

Workaround: There is now workaround.

* CSCty53054

Symptoms: Tracebacks show up on standby sometimes when  **shut/unshut** of the p2mp TE tunnel.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when a dual RP box  **shut/noshut**  of the p2mp TE tunnel may generate traceback. There is no functionality impact.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty57137

Symptoms: SIP SPAs go out of service state in scaled subinterface config (more than 2000 subinterfaces on single GigE port).

Conditions: While performing ISSU between iso1-rp2 and iso2-rp2 xe3.6 throttle image, after issu runversion, the SIP SPAs go out of service state. Need heavily scaled config. Seen when there are 2000 to 3000 subinterfaces on the single SPA and following limits are exceeded. Overall dual stack VRFs per box: 2800 dual stack limit on interface: 1000.

Workaround: The issue is not seen in the following scenario:

 1. Before doing a load version from RP0 (initial active), issue the following command: asr1000# show ipv6 route table | inc IPv6.

 2. Note down the number of ipv6 route tables in the system.

 3. Do a load version.

 4. Wait for standby to come up to Standby hot.

 5. Enable standby console from RP0 (active) asr1000#configure terminal Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z. asr1000(config)# asr1000(config)#redundancy asr1000(config-red)#main-cpu asr1000(config-r-mc)#standby console enable.

 6. Login to standby console and issue the following command asr1000-stby# show ipv6 route table | inc IPv6 Again note down the number of IPv6 route tables in standby. If it is less than the number noted at step2, wait for some time and re-verify till it reaches the number noted in step 2.

 7. Issue issu runversion from RP0 (active)

* CSCty59891

Symptoms: On the node where  **shut/no shut** is issued, traffic does not reach IPsec VSPA which is supposed to get encrypted.

Conditions: Issue  **shut/no shut** on the GRE tunnel protected with IPsec and QoS configured on this IPsec Tunnel.

Workaround: Remove and attach “tunnel protection ipsec profile”.

* CSCty64216

Symptoms: On unconfiguring a scaled ACL, a router crash is noted.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with an ACL having 1000 ACEs or more when unconfigured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz06740

Conditions: PE-to-PE tunnel is down, and Next hop to PE1 has TE tunnel to remote PE2. PE1 is Cisco ME3600.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz17175

Symptoms: Traffic loss for 100 seconds will be seen.

Condition: When the router with ~32K VCs configured is reloaded.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz37164

Symptoms: The requests to the radius server are retransmitted even though the session no longer exists. This causes unnecessary traffic to radius and also radius gets requests for an invalid session.

Conditions: This issue occurs when the radius server is unreachable and the CPE times out the session

Workaround: The issue can be seen as per the conditions mentioned above. This can be avoided by making sure that the radius server is always reachable

* CSCtz49200

Symptoms: OSPF IPv6 control packets are not encrypted/decrypted.

Conditions: Occurs while configuring the ipv6 ospf authentication.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz50204

Symptoms: Crash is seen while applying “vrf ivrf2” on Server.

Conditions: Crash is seen while applying “vrf ivrf2” on Server.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz50537

Symptoms: Deactivation of ipv4 unicast rpf via radius does not work.

Conditions: Occurs when you configure a user profile in Radius with an AVPair: Cisco-AVPair += “lcp:interface-config=no ip verify unicast source reachable-via rx”.

No error appears in debugs or logs. The same configuration works in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.x releases but does not work in 3.x releases.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz62857

Symptoms: RP crashes with segmentation fault pointing to IP RIB Update process.

Conditions: This problem is seen if you issue the configuration command: no router bgp during the period between when BGP is first configured and when it completes routing protocol initialization and bulk sync to the standby.

Workaround: Wait for BGP initialization and bulk sync to complete before issuing “no router bgp”. How long this takes will vary by platform, configuration, and routing table size. On an Cisco ASR 1004 with an RP2 route processor and a typical configuration and routing table size, this takes no longer than 20 minutes.

* CSCtz63438

Symptoms: In a GETVPN environment, the group member continuously registers to keyserver.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the onboard crypto engine is disabled on a Cisco 1900 series platform.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz69517

Symptoms: IPv6 VRF data packets are getting punted to CPU.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz70207

Symptoms: The device experiences an I/O memory leak in the “Big” buffer pool.

Conditions: Occurs when you configure NetFlow data export and the device is actively exporting traffic to a collector.

Workaround: Disable NF/NF data export.

* CSCtz71084

Symptoms: When prefix from CE is lost, the related route that was advertised as best-external to RR by PE0 does not get withdrawn.

Conditions:

PE0#conf t

Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.

PE0(config)#router bgp 1

PE0(config-router)#address-family ipv4 vrf CE2

PE0(config-router-af)#import path selection all

PE0(config-router-af)#bgp recursion host

PE0(config-router-af)#bgp advertise-best-external

PE0(config-router-af)#end

Even though the configs have SOO, it is not necessary for the repro.

However, the issue is not happening if we shut the interface between PE0-CE2 from either side. Instead, need to do something like the following to stop CE2 to advertise the prefixes:

CE2#conf t

Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.

CE2(config)#router bgp 2

CE2(config-router)#no network 100.1.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0

CE2(config-router)#no network 110.1.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0

CE2(config-router)#no network 120.1.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0

CE2(config-router)#

Conditions: Issue is seen soon after performing SSO.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz90328

Symptoms: Multicast traffic stops for some time because of CPU Hog on removal of the QoS policy-map from the service instance.

Conditions: Occurs when the Multicast traffic is bursty and is oversubscribing the queue.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz91502

Symptoms: Nile unicast met shows multiple ReplicationContextQueueEntry, and traffic is flooded to all ports in vlan.

Conditions: The issue is seen when a access port is in the same vlan as the rep segment. A rep flap is seen.

Workaround: Clear mac-address table fixes the CQE entries.

* CSCtz92606

Symptoms: MFR memberlinks - T1 serial intfs created under a CHOC12 controller, do not get decoupled from MFR even after the MFR bundle intf is deleted. And once the MFR bundle interface is reconfigured, the memberlinks does not appear under it.

Conditions: MFR with memberlinks as T1 serials from CHOC12 sonet controller.

Workaround: Unconfigure and reconfigure the “encap frame-relay MFRx” under each memberlink after reconfiguring the MFR bundle interface.

* CSCtz97297

Symptoms: Router takes sporadically up to 5 seconds to forward multicast after IGMP join is received.

Conditions: None.

Workaround: Use static IGMP join on egress interface.

* CSCua01641

* CSCua13804

Symptoms: Router crashes when doing snmp query on ERM- Resource Groups.

Condition: Crash occurs only when a resource group is configured.

Work around: There is no workaround.

* CSCua20373

Symptoms: After SSO, we will see all the GRE tunnels get admin down and it stays down until the security module SSC-600/WS-IPSEC-3 comes up. We see complete traffic loss during this time.

Conditions: Have Vanilla GRE tunnels configured in the system where HA and IPsec Module SSC-600/WS-IPSEC-3 card is present and issue SSO.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua21238

Symptoms: IOSD crashes at \_ipv6\_address\_set\_tentative.

Conditions: Occurs while unconfiguring ipv6 subinterfaces.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua23451

Symptoms: High convergence is seen on Cisco 7600 SUP720 switchover (oir or software cli) in 1 out of 10 readings.

Conditions: Occurs with high convergence on Cisco 7600 SUP720 switchover (oir or software cli) in 1 out of 10 readings.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua23570

Symptoms: IS-IS adjacency remains down on the standby RP while it is up on the active RP. If a switchover occurs this may result in an adjacency flap as the Standby transition to Active.

Conditions: Occurs when you apply the multi-topology command under the IPv6 address family and the router receives IPv6 prefixes through IS-IS.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua24676

Symptoms: VRF to global packet’s length are corrupted by -1.

Conditions: Issue is seen when the next-hop in vrf is global and recursive going out labled. Issue is seen from Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)S3a onwards and not seen on Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)S2.

Workaround: Use next hop interface ip instead of recursive next hop.

* CSCua25943

Symptoms: CPU Hog is seen on the LC with CMFI Background process hogging the CPU.

Conditions: It is observed when more than 10k IPv6 prefixes are pumped into the router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua26064

Symptoms: IPv6 routes in the global routing table take up different adjacency entries.

Conditions: It is seen when there are 4 core facing tunnels that load balance traffic to these prefixes. “show mls cef ipv6 <prefix> detail” shows the different adjacencies taken by different prefixes.

Workaround: Have a single tunnel on the core facing side, instead of a load balanced path.

* CSCua26981

Symptoms: A Cisco ASR router may crash due to a CPU Watchdog upon invocation of “show ip eigrp neighbor detail.”

 `CMD: 'sh ip eigrp nei detail'`

 `<snip>`

 `ASR1000-WATCHDOG: Process = Exec`

 `%SCHED-0-WATCHDOG: Scheduler running for a long time, more than the maximum configured (120) secs.`

 `-Traceback=...`

Conditions: The Cisco ASR router must be experiencing rapid changes in EIGRP neighborship, such as during a flap. One way to artificially create this scenario is to mismatch the interface MTU.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua27842

Symptoms: The Cisco ASR 1000 router crashes in Firewall code due to NULL l4\_info pointer. Day 1 issue.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the Cisco ASR 1000 router acts as the MPLS L3VPN UHP. It crashes because FW/NAT requires the l4\_info to be set. To trigger this issue, the following features must be configured:

 1. MPLS L3VPN (PE)

 2. Zone Based FW/NAT

 3. MPLS & MP-BGP loadbalance configured towards upstream router

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua27852

Symptoms: Traffic loss is seen in pure BGP nsr peering environment.

Conditions: The symptom is seen on Cisco router with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S, and the bgp peerings to CEs and RR are all NSR enabled.

Workaround: Enable the bgp graceful-restart for RR peering.

* CSCua29001

Conditions: DHCP server did not send an ACK to the DHCPREQUEST sent by the client.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua31794

Symptoms: After reload with the debug image, framed E1 lines are down.

Conditions: On checking the “show controller SONET”, the default controller framing mode is taken as “crc4”. However before reload the configuration for those E1s were configured as “no-crc4”. Customer configured them on the E1s as “no-crc4” and it started working fine and the “show controller SONET” framing output changed to “no-crc4”. As per running configuration still the configuration is not showing “no-crc4”, as it should show as the default is CRC4. So the current issue is configuring “No-crc4”, it is not showing in running configuration and not saved and after reload it shows again CRC4 and services go down again.

Workaround: Configure E1s as “no-crc4” and they would be working fine, but such changes are not being saved in configuration, so if reload reoccurs all these services go down again.

* CSCua31934

Symptoms: Crash seen at \_\_be\_address\_is\_unspecified.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. It occurs one out of three times, and it is a timing issue.

 2. DMVPN tunnel setup between Cisco 2901 as spoke and Cisco ASR 1000 as hub.

 3. Pass IPv4 and IPv6 traffic between the hub and the spoke for 5-10 minutes.

 4. It can occur with v6 traffic alone.

 5. If you remove the tunnel interface on the ASR and add it again using conf replace nvram:startup-config the crash will occur.

Workaround: Use CLI to change configuration instead of the rollback feature.

* CSCua33287

Symptoms: ES+: L2TPv3 entries are programmed incorrectly after restart.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when some L2TPv3 sessions are established on ES+ module. After the restart of ES+, some np entries may not program correctly. As the result, ES+ will stop to transmit packets.

This condition will recover after executing shut/no shut on physical interfaces.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua33527

Symptoms: Traceback seen after second or third switchover:

 `%LFD-SW2-3-SMBADEVENT: Unexpected event CO_WAIT_TIMEOUT for state RUNNING -Traceback= 7908E9Cz 7909848z 79099CCz 7909B9Cz 78DBF20z 523292Cz 522C1D4z`

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a quad-sup scenario/setup. This traceback is seen on the new active RP after second switchover onwards.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua34033

Symptoms: Cisco ME 3800x hangs after boot.

Conditions: It is possible for an Evaluation Scaled license to be configured on the router and scaled services license configured. EULA acceptance can be ignored when configuring this. When the Cisco ME 3800x is rebooted, the router needs to program itself differently for a scaled license than a base license but it cannot do so without the EULA being accepted so the router issues a prompt on the console port. The router will wait here until a user has responded. However, if a user is not on the console port to see this EULA message, they will not know that it is waiting for an EULA response and so the router will continue to wait.

This is not seen on purchased licenses as they are not installed unless the EULA is accepted.

Workaround: When using evaluation licenses, accept the EULA upon configuring a license on the router or only reload the router from a connection to the console port after configuring the router to use an evaluation license.

* CSCua37333

Symptoms: The router displays an EIGRP Active Route in the routing table.

Conditions: Occurs on the Cisco ASR 1000 with Cisco IOS Releases 15.1(3)S2 and 15.1(3)S3.

Symptoms: Checksum value parsed from GRE header is not populating causing the GRE tunnel checksum test case to fail.

Conditions: The issue is seen on a Cisco ISR G2.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua45114

Symptoms: Default sessions will not establish when you apply VRF as a service to the default policy. VRF can only be applied to a default session by assigning a VRF on the access-interface. However with dedicated sessions, one cannot apply a VRF on the access-interface and VRF transfer at the same time. Thus if we require VRF transfer on dedicated sessions, we need VRF transfer on lite sessions as well.

Conditions: Access-side interface is in the default VRF, VRF is applied as a service to the default policy.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua46210

Symptoms: Packets are not decrypted for specific ezvpn client and ping fails.

XE37: overhead accounting need to be configured on both parent and child policy

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua63182

Symptoms: Incorrect minimum bandwidth is displayed when a 0k received.

Conditions: Different behavior in Cisco ASR code when Min BW of 0 Kbit is received.

 `2.6.2 uses 10 Gbps as Min BW in case Min BW = 0 received`

 `3.4.3 uses 1 Kbit as Min BW in case Min BW = 0 received`

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua64546

Symptoms: In scaled setup with IPV4 and IPV6 ACL together (not necessarily on same interface), IPV4 ACLs may stop working if IPV6 ACL configured later overwrites the ipv4 acl results and vice versa.

Conditions: Occurs when IPV4 and IPV6 ACLs are configured on the box.

Workaround: Not perfect workaround, reconfiguring the IPV4 ACL can recover the functionality but will affect the IPV6 ACL.

Further Problem Description: Only IPV4 or IPV6 ACL configuration will work.

* CSCua64676

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtl01184

Symptoms: Sometimes an EVC that is configured on ES+ sends frames out with CFI bit set in the VLAN tag.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on EVCs that are configured on ES+.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtl18571

Symptoms: On a Cisco 7600 series router with etherchannels configured, the show etherchannel load-balance module x command shows VLAN included even though the excluded VLAN has been configured globally using the port-channel load-balance algorithm exclude vlan command.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the system is operating in pfc3c or pfc3cxl mode with CFC and DFC card without per module load-balance.

Workaround: This is an issue with the show command. The algorithm itself is not affected. The load-balancing algorithm is applied correctly as configured globally.

* CSCtr36083

Symptoms: IKE SAs are not cleared. Ping fails over the IPsec tunnel.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when SAs are cleared by using the clear crypto session local address command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtr93412

Symptoms: Crash seen on mwheel process.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with GETVPN multicast followed by clear crypto gdo.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCts00341

Symptoms: When executing a CLI that requires domain-name lookup such as ntp server server.domain.com, the command fails with the following message on the console:

 `ASR1k(config)#ntp server server.domain.com <<< DNS is not resolved`

 `with dual RPs on ASR1k`

 `Translating "server.domain.com "...domain server (10.1.1.1) [OK]`

 `%ERROR: Standby doesn't support this command ^`

 `% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.`

 `ASR1k(config)#do sh run | i ntp`

 `ASR1k(config)#`

Conditions: This symptom occurs on a redundant RP chassis operating in SSO mode.

Workaround: Instead of using hostname in the command, specify the IP address of the host.

* CSCts12499

Symptoms: SPA firmware crash at one bay leads to SPA crash in another bay.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when “test crash cema” is executed from the SPA console. leading to the SPA in the other bay to reload. Also, the crashinfo is not present in the RP disk.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCts44393

Symptoms: A Cisco ASR 1000 crashes.

Conditions: The symptom is more likely to occur when a large number of VRFs are repeatedly configured and deleted.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCts68626

Symptoms: PPPoE discovery packets causes packet drop.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you bring up a PPPoE session and then clear the session.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtt26692

Symptoms: Router crashes due to memory corruption. In the crashinfo you may see:

 `%SYS-2-CHUNKBADMAGIC: Bad magic number in chunk header, chunk xxxxxxx data`

 `Process= "CCSIP_SPI_CONTROL", ipl= 0, pid= 374`

 `chunk_diagnose, code = 1`

 `chunk name is MallocLite`

Conditions: Router is configured for SIP. When a translation-rule is configured to translate a number to one with more digits, the router may crash when the translation takes effect, such as when a call is forwarded.

Workaround: Configuring “no memory lite” configurations can be used as a workaround in some cases (depending on the length of the phone numbers), but will cause the router to use more memory. If the translation-profile is configured to translate forwarded calls, then avoid or disable the option to forward the call.

* CSCtt35379

Symptoms: BGP Processing Enhancements.

* CSCtt45654

Symptoms: In a DVTI IPSec + NAT-t scaling case, when doing session flapping continually, several Virtual-Access interfaces are “protocol down” and are not deleted.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtw55424

Symptoms: SSH with “vrf” in command line for IPv6 addr/host is not working. For example: ssh -l username -vrf vrfname ipv6 add/host.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when ip ssh source-interface is not defined and the user specifies the VRF by command line (e.g.: ssh -l username -vrf vrfname ipv6 add/host).

Workaround: Use ip ssh source-interface interface-name and connect with ssh -l username (IPv4/IPv6)(addr/host).

* CSCtw62310

Symptoms: The cells keyword is added to “random-detect” whenever a policy-map is removed from an interface/map-class via “no service- policy”.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when removing the policy-map from map-class.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Further Problem Description: The CLI is technically valid if it has been manually configured as “cells” prior to the removal. The issue is that the template policy is being changed automatically to “cells” whenever the removal happens, regardless of what the original configuration was, and that is not the expected behavior.

* CSCtw70298

Symptoms: A router crashes after the router boots up with scaled configuration and L2/L3 Distributed EtherChannel (DEC) or port-channel.

Conditions: This symptom occurs only if there are more than two or more DFCs (ES+ and other equivalents) and with L2/L3 DEC configured such that one of the DFCs takes much longer to come up than the other.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtw73530

Symptoms: Unable to delete metadata sessions.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when more than 100 metadata sessions are created.

Workaround: Disable metadata and then enable it. Note that this will remove all the flows.

* CSCtw79171

Symptoms: Platform asserts at adjmgr\_l2\_create.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with excessive flapping of a link.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx05726

Symptoms: When creating a bulk number of traffic engineering tunnel interfaces on the router with option tunnel mpls traffic-eng exp-bundle master, the standby route processor crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with a specific set of configurations which has creation of a large number of tunnel interfaces (scale number 1000) followed by creation of large number of master tunnels (scale number 1000). Copying such a configuration to the router causes this crash on the standby processor.

The tunnel interfaces which are created at the beginning of the configuration are added as members to the master tunnels in the later part of the configuration. During this phase of creation of the master tunnels and adding member tunnels, these tunnel interfaces go through a cycle of “create-delete-create”. When such a configuration is being synced to the standby route processor along with the resulting create-delete events, the standby processor crashes.

This point where crash happens is random and can happen during configuration of any of the master tunnels.

Workaround: There is no workaround. Once the standby reboots after the crash, the configurations on the active are synced to the standby and this sync does not cause any crash. Crash is only during the initial copy of the configurations to the router.

* CSCtx06813

Symptoms: Installation fails, “rwid type l2ckt” error messages appear, and the VC may fail to come up on Quad-Sup router only. Though this error may appear for multiple other reasons, this bug is specific to Cisco Catalyst 6000 Quad-Sup SSO only.

Conditions: The symptom is observed in a scaled scenario, doing second switchover on Quad-Sup router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx11598

Symptoms: A router reload causes a Cisco Shared Port Adapter (SPA) failure with the following error message:

 `% CWAN_SPA-3-FAILURE: SPA-2CHT3-CE-ATM[2/2]: SPA failure`

This failure can cause the SPA to go to one of the following states:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) none

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) standby reset

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) down

This failure leads to unexpected system reload.

Conditions: This symptom is observed during router reload for 15-20 times.

Workaround: Ensure that all of the library shared objects are loaded at the time of the SPA initialization.

* CSCtx32527

Symptoms: The show crypto session command reveals the flexVPN GRE tunnel is in a DOWN state instead of DOWN-negotiating.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with “ip address negotiated” configured on the GRE tunnel interface (with tunnel protection). The tunnel is unable to reach the gateway initially.

Workaround: Configure an IP address on the tunnel interface instead of “ip address negotiated”.

* CSCtx35064

Symptoms: Traffic remains on blackholed path until holddown timer expires for PfR monitored traffic class. Unreachables are seen on path, but no reroute occurs until holddown expires.

Conditions: This symptom is seen under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) MC reroutes traffic-class out a particular path (BR/external interface) due to OOP condition on the primary path.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Shortly after enforcement occurs, an impairment on the new primary path occurs causing blackhole.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) PfR MC does not declare OOP on the new primary path and attempt to find a new path until Holddown timer expires. Causes traffic loss.

Workaround: Reduce the holddown timer to 90 seconds (minimum value) to minimize impact.

* CSCtx36095

Symptoms: A traceback is seen after applying DMLP configurations while doing a line card reload.

Conditions: This symptom occurs during a line card reload.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx38121

Symptoms: IPv6 traffic is not passing through the interface attached with service policy matching IPv6 traffic using IPv6 ACL.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when attaching a service policy matching IPv6 traffic that is configured using ipv6 access-list on EFP of an interface, which will lead to a traffic drop.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx47213

Symptoms: The following symptoms are observed:

 1. Session flap when iBGP local-as is being used on RRs.

 2. Replace-as knob is not working in iBGP local-as case.

Conditions:

 1. The session will flap when iBGP local-as is used on the RR client and RR sends an update.

 2. Replace-as knob even used is ignored and prefixes are appended with local-as.

Workaround: Do not use iBGP local-as.

* CSCtx57073

Symptoms: A Cisco router may crash with the following error:

 `"Segmentation fault(11), Process = Metadata HA"`

Conditions: This symptom is observed while upgrading the router from Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6 to mcp dev.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx66046

Symptoms: The Standby RP crashes with a traceback listing db\_free\_check.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when OSPF NSR is configured. A tunnel is used and is unnumbered with the address coming from a loopback interface. A network statement includes the address of the loopback interface. This issue is seen when removing the address from the loopback interface.

Workaround: Before removing the address, remove the network statement which covers he address of the loopback interface.

* CSCtx67474

Symptoms: Update message is sent with an empty NLRI when the message consists of 2byte aspath in ASPATH attribute and 4byte value aggregate attribute.

Conditions: This can happen when there is a mix of 2byte and 4byte attributes in the update message and the message is sent from a 2byte peer and there is a 4byte aggregator attribute.

Workaround: Move all the 2byte AS peers to a separate update-group using a non-impacting outbound policy like “advertisement-interval”.

* CSCtx73612

Symptoms: A Cisco ASR 1000 may reload while reading IPsec MIBs via SNMP and write a crashfile.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on a Cisco ASR 1000 that is running Cisco IOS Release 15.1(1)S1.

Workaround: Do not poll or trap IPsec information via SNMP.

* CSCtx77501

Symptoms: Traffic is dropped at decap side of PE box.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with SSO at decap side of MVPN set-up, DFC core-facing, 6748 access facing.

Workaround: Do a switchover.

* CSCtx77750

Symptoms: Crosstalk may be heard by PSTN callers when a call is placed on hold and Music on Hold (MMOH) is enabled.

Conditions: CUCM is configured to do Multicast MoH.

Workaround:

Workaround: Disable VFR or CEF.

* CSCtx95840

Symptoms: A Cisco voice gateway may unexpectedly reload.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on a Cisco voice gateway running SIP protocol. In this case the issue was when sipSPIUfreeOneCCB() returns, the leftover event is still being processed after CCB is released from sipSPIUfreeOneCCB(). Based on sipSPIStartRemoveTransTimer(ccb), CCB should have been released later by a background timer.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty01237

Symptoms: The router logs show:

 `<timestamp> %OER_BR-5-NOTICE: Prefix Learning STARTED`

 `CMD: 'show run' <timestamp>`

This is followed by the router crashing.

Conditions: This issue is seen under the following conditions:

 1. Configure PfR with a learn-list using a prefix-list as a filter and enable learn.

 2. Use a configuration tool, script or NMS that periodically executes show run on the MC over HTTP or some other means.

Workaround 1: If you use PfR learn-list feature, do not execute show run periodically.

Workaround 2: If you use a monitoring tool that executes show run periodically, avoid using a learn-list configuration in PfR.

* CSCty03745

Symptoms: BGP sends an update using the incorrect next-hop for the L2VPN VPLS address-family, when the IPv4 default route is used, or an IPv4 route to certain destination exists. Specifically, a route to 0.x.x.x exists. For this condition to occur, the next-hop of that default route or certain IGP/static route is used to send a BGP update for the L2VPN VPLS address-family.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the IPv4 default route exists, that is:

 `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next-hop>.`

Or a certain static/IGP route exists: For example:

 `ip route 0.0.253.0 255.255.255.0 <next-hop>.`

Workaround 1: Configure next-hop-self for BGP neighbors under the L2VPN VPLS address-family. address-family. For example:

 `router bgp 65000`

 `address-family l2vpn vpls`

 `neighbor 10.10.10.10 next-hop-self`

Workaround 2: Remove the default route or the static/IGP route from the IPv4 routing table.

* CSCty05092

Symptoms: EIGRP advertises the connected route of an interface which is shut down.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Configure EIGRP on an interface.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Configure an IP address with a supernet mask on the above interface.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Shut the interface. You will find that EIGRP still advertises the connected route of the above interface which is shut down.

Workaround 1: Remove and add INTERFACE VLAN xx.

Workaround 2: Clear ip eigrp topology x.x.x.x/y.

* CSCty08070

Symptoms: Router may print error message and traceback similar to the following example:

 `%SCHED-STBY-3-THRASHING: Process thrashing on watched`

 `boolean 'OSPFv3 Router`

 `boolean'. -Process= "OSPFv3R-10/4/2", ipl= 5, pid= 830router ospf`

 `-Traceback= 7235C3Cz 7235F1Cz 6A5F7A8z 6A6168Cz 50DA290z 50D3B44zv`

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the affected OSPFv3 router is configured, but the process does not run because it has no router-id configured. Further, an area command is configured, for example “area X stub”.

Workaround: Configure “router-id” so the process can run.

* CSCty16620

Symptoms: Backup pseudowire in SVIEoMPLS does not come up after reloading the router.

Conditions: This symptom is seen under the following conditions:

 1. Remote PE on the backup PW does not support pseudowire status TLV.

 2. The “no status TLV” is not configured in pw-class used in the PW, which does not support pseudowire status TLV.

Workarounds:

Proactive workaround: Configure “no status TLV” into the pw-class used if the remote side does not support status TLV.

Reactive workaround: Reprovision the backup pseudowire after reload.

* CSCty17288

Symptoms: MIB walk returns looping OID.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when a media mon policy is configured.

Workaround: Walk around CiscoMgmt.9999.

* CSCty23747

Symptoms: MAC address withdrawal messages are not being sent.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with flapping REP ports on UPE.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty24606

Symptoms: Under certain circumstances, the Cisco ASR 1000 series router’s ASR CUBE can exhibit stale call legs on the new active after switchover even though media inactivity is configured properly.

Conditions: This symptom is observed during High Availability and box to box redundancy, and after a failover condition. Some call legs stay in an active state even though no media is flowing on the new active. The call legs can not be removed manually unless by a manual software restart of the whole chassis. The call legs do not impact normal call processing.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty29230

Symptoms: CMFIB entries are not being programmed on the SP and DFCs. Mroute shows both Accept and OILS, ip mfib output also shows Accept interface and Forwarding interface, but CMFIB entries are not programmed.

Conditions: Cisco 7600 running a Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)S throttle.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty30886

Symptoms: A standby RP reloads.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when bringing up PPPoE sessions with configured invalid local IP address pool under virtual-template profile and “aaa authorization network default group radius” on the box with no radius present. No IP address is assigned to PPPoE Client.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty32463

Symptoms: When you boot an ASR-1002-X or an ASR-1001 in dual IOSd mode (SSO), the standby process comes up and SSO gets executed but the configuration is unable to sync up between the two processes:

 `%REDUNDANCY-5-PEER_MONITOR_EVENT: Active detected a standby insertion`

 `(raw-event=PEER_FOUND(4))`

 `%REDUNDANCY-5-PEER_MONITOR_EVENT: Active detected a standby insertion`

 `(raw-event=PEER_REDUNDANCY_STATE_CHANGE(5))`

 `%LICENSE-3-BULK_SYNC_FAILED: License bulk sync operation Priority Sync for`

 `! <submode> "crypto-ca-cert-chain"`

 `Cannot finish user input data read from fd 17`

 `%RF-5-RF_TERMINAL_STATE: Terminal state reached for (SSO)`

 `kp_perf1>`

When this part of the configuration is removed, the issue is not seen:

 `crypto pki certificate chain root-tank.com`

 `! <submode> "crypto-ca-cert-chain"`

 `- ^C`

 `! </submode> "crypto-ca-cert-chain"`

Conditions: The position of the ^C is causing the issue.

Workaround: The starting “^C” should be placed at the same line as “certificate ca”. For example:

 `certificate ca ^C`

 `44AFB080D6A327BA893039862EF8406B`

`......`

 `quit^C`

* CSCty32728

Symptoms: CPU hog is seen when MVPN configuration is replaced with another using the configure replace command.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a stable MVPN network when replacing the configuration with dual-home receiver/source configuration once the router comes up with the tunnel.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty32851

Symptoms: A Cisco router may unexpectedly reload due to software forced crash exception when changing the encapsulation on a serial interface to “multilink ppp”.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the interface is configured with a VRF.

Workaround: Shut down the interface before making the encap configuration change.

* CSCty34020

Symptoms: A Cisco 7201 router’s GigabitEthernet0/3 port may randomly stop forwarding traffic.

Conditions: This only occurs on Gig0/3 and possibly Fa0/0 as they both are based on different hardware separate from the first three built-in gig ports.

Workaround: Use ports Gig0/0-Gig 0/2.

* CSCty34200

Symptoms: In MVPN scale environment, a crash is observed after “no ip multicast-routing”. A memory leak is observed after changing data MDT address.

Conditions: This symptom is seen in MVPN scale scenario.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty35134

Symptoms: Data traffic out of REP EdgeNoNeighbor fails to flow.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when MST runs on the node when “rep stcn stp” is configured. If the MST puts this port to BLK then REP EdgeNN stops forwarding traffic.

Workaround: When having “rep stcn stp” configured on the rep port, we should not have a topology such that MST puts this port to blocking.

* CSCty43587

Symptoms: Crash observed with memory corruption similar to the following:

 `%SYS-2-FREEFREE: Attempted to free unassigned memory at XXXXXXXX, alloc XXXXXXXX, dealloc XXXXXXXX`

Conditions: The symptom is observed when SIP is configured on the router or SIP traffic is flowing through it.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty48870

Symptoms: Router crash due to a bus error.

Conditions: This has been observed in router that is running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)T and 15.2(3)T with NBAR enabled on a crypto-enabled interface. NBAR can be enabled through NAT, QoS, or NBAR protocol discovery.

Workaround: Using no ip nat service nbar will help where NBAR is enabled through NAT.

* CSCty49656

Symptoms: A crash is observed when executing the no ip routing command.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

 1. Use a Cisco IOS image that has fix for CSCtg94470.

 2. Configure OSPF.

 3. Enable multicast.

 4. Create several (>6000) routes in the network to be learned by OSPF.

 5. Wait for OSPF to learn all the (>6000) routes from the network.

Finally, executing the no ip routing command may crash the box.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty51088

Symptoms: On a Cisco ME 3600X or Cisco ME 3800X, when traffic for a group (S2,G) is sent to an interface that is already acting as the source for another group (S1,G), it does not receive any traffic since no (S2,G) entry is formed.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the receiver interface is already a source interface for another multicast stream.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty53243

Symptoms: Video call fails in the latest mcp\_dev image asr1000rp2-adventerprisek9.BLD\_MCP\_DEV\_LATEST\_20120303\_065105\_2.bin. This image has the uc\_infra version: uc\_infra@(mt\_152\_4)1.0.13. Note that video call works fine with the previous mcp\_dev image asr1000rp2-adventerprisek9.BLD\_MCP\_DEV\_LATEST\_20120219\_084446\_2.bin.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when CUBE changes the video port to “0” in 200 OK sent to the UAC.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty54319

Symptoms: OSPF and protocols using 224.0.0.x will not work btw CE-CE over a VLAN.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when IGMP snooping is disabled.

Workaround: Toggle IGMP snooping two times.

* CSCty55449

Symptoms: The device crashes after registering an Embedded Event Manager TCL policy.

Conditions: If the policy uses the multiple event feature and the trigger portion is registered without curly braces (“{}”), then the device will crash. For example, this policy will trigger a crash:

 `::cisco::eem::event_register_syslog tag 1 pattern " pattern1"`

 `::cisco::eem::event_register_syslog tag 2 pattern " pattern2"`

 `::cisco::eem::trigger`

 `::cisco::eem::correlate event 1 or event 2`

 `namespace import ::cisco::eem::*`

 `namespace import ::cisco::lib::*`

 `action_syslog priority crit msg " triggered "`

Note how “::cisco::eem::trigger” is not followed by an opening curly brace.

Workaround: Ensure that the trigger portion (i.e.: the correlate statement) is enclosed within curly braces. Given the example above, the proper syntax is:

 `::cisco::eem::event_register_syslog tag 1 pattern " pattern1"`

 `::cisco::eem::event_register_syslog tag 2 pattern " pattern2"`

 `::cisco::eem::trigger {`

 `::cisco::eem::correlate event 1 or event 2`

 `}`

 `namespace import ::cisco::eem::*`

 `namespace import ::cisco::lib::*`

 `action_syslog priority crit msg " triggered "`

* CSCty58241

Symptoms: The following symptoms are observed:

Symptom 1. You may receive the following error when you enable radius debugs:

RADIUS: Response for non-existent request ident

Symptom 2. The radius alias functionality may not work.

Conditions:

For symptom 1: You move from the alias-based configuration to non-alias based configuration and you remove the host first and alias next. In the new configuration if one of the alias becomes the primary host address this will lead to symptom 1.

For symptom 2: If the reply comes from the alias IP address the functionality may not work.

Workarounds:

For symptom 1: - Reload the router; or - Unconfigure the alias first before unconfiguring the host.

For symptom 2: - Do not use the alias on the NAS.

* CSCty58992

Symptoms: One-way audio is observed after transfer to a SIP POTS Phone.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cluster is in v6 mode.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A call is made from Phone1 to Phone2, and then Phone2 transfers the call to Phone3(SIP POTS), which is when the issue occurs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty63868

Symptoms: CUBE crashes at sipSPICheckHeaderSupport.

Conditions: CUBE crashes while running the codenomicon suite.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty64721

Symptoms: Improper memory allocation by CTI process crashes the CME.

Conditions: The CTI front end process is using up huge memory causing the CME to crash eventually. When the crash occurs:

 `Processor Pool Total: 140331892 Used: 140150164 Free: 181728`

 `I/O Pool Total: 27262976 Used: 5508816 Free: 21754160`

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty68348

Symptoms: If the OSPF v2 process is configured with the nsr command for OSPF nonstop routing, (seen after shutdown/no shutdown of the OSPF process), the neighbor is seen on standby RP as FULL/DROTHER, although the expected state is FULL/DR or FULL/BDR. As a result, after switchover, routes pointing to the FULL/DROTHER neighbor may not be installed into RIB.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The OSPF router is configured for “nsr”.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Shutdown/no shutdown of the OSPF process.

Workaround: Flapping of the neighbor will fix the issue.

* CSCty68402

* CSCty71843

Symptoms: Tracebacks observed at lfd\_sm\_start and lfd\_sm\_handle\_event\_state\_stopped APIs during router bootup.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with L2VPN (Xconnect with MPLS encapsulation) functionality on a Cisco 1941 router (acting as edge) running Cisco IOS interim Release 15.2(3.3)T. This is observed when a router is reloaded with the L2VPN configurations.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty73817

Symptoms: In large-scale PPPoE sessions with QoS, the Standby RP might reboot continuously (until the workaround is applied) after switchover. This issue is seen when the QoS Policy Accounting feature is used. When the issue occurs, the Active RP remains operational and the Standby RP reboots with the following message:

 `%PLATFORM-6-EVENT_LOG: 43 3145575308: *Mar 16 13:47:23.482: %QOS-6-RELOAD: Index addition failed, reloading self`

Conditions: This symptom occurs when all the following conditions are met:

 1. There is a large amount of sessions.

 2. The QoS Policy Accounting feature is used.

 3. Switchover is done.

Workaround: Bring down sessions before switchover. For example, shut down the physical interfaces that the sessions go through, or issue the Cisco IOS command clear pppoe all.

* CSCty76106

Symptoms: Crash is seen after two days of soaking with traffic.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with node acting as ConPE with multiple services like REP, MST, L3VPN, L2VPN, constant frequent polling of SNMP, RCMD, full scale of routes and bidirectional traffic.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty78435

Symptoms: L3VPN prefixes that need to recurse to a GRE tunnel using an inbound route-map cannot be selectively recursed using route-map policies. All prefixes NH recurse to a GRE tunnel configured in an encapsulation profile.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when an inbound route-map is used to recurse L3VPN NH to a GRE tunnel. Prefixes are received as part of the same update message and no other inbound policy change is done.

Workaround: Configure additional inbound policy changes such as a community change and remove it prior to sending it out.

* CSCty80553

Symptoms: Multicast router crashes.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when multicast traffic is routed through an IPsec tunnel and multicast packets are big causing fragmentation.

Workaround: Make sure that multicast packet sizes do not exceed tunnel transport MTU.

* CSCty81700

Symptoms: When a remote PE reloads in MVPN network, it causes a memory leak.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when core interface flap or remote PE node reloads causing a small amount of memory leak. If the node stays up experiencing a lot of core interface/remote PE outages, it can run out of memory and fail to establish PIM neighborship with remote PEs.

Workaround: There is no workaround. As a proactive measure, user can periodically (depending on n/w outages) run the show memory debug leak chunk command and reload the node, if there are a lot of memory leaks reported by this command.

* CSCty83357

Symptoms: ACL denied packets are getting punted to host queue, leading to flaps in routing protocols.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when ACL is configured with src IP match, and packets are being denied by the ACL. The packets are punted to the CPU.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty83520

Symptoms: IP Phone -- CUCM --- H323 -- 3845 - PSTN:

 1. A call is originated from the IP phone to a PSTN number and it gets connected.

 2. The IP phone puts the call on hold.

 3. The CUCM instructs GW to listen to the Multicast MoH stream.

 4. The Cisco IOS Gateway sends the RTCP packet to Multicast MoH.

* CSCty94289

Symptoms: The drop rate is nearly 1 Mbps with priority configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when traffic received in the MSFC router class-default is the same as on the other end of the MSFC2 router.

Workaround: Unconfigure the priority and configure the bandwidth, and then check for the offered rate in both the routers. This issue is only seen with the Cisco 7600 series routers (since the issue is with the Flexwan line cards). The issue is seen with a priority configuration and does not show up when the priority is unconfigured, so there is no workaround as such for this issue otherwise.

* CSCty96049

Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a single DHCP packet to or through an affected device, causing the device to reload.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is available. This advisory is available at the following link:

 <http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120926-dhcp>

* CSCty96052

* CSCtz04090

Symptoms: In a VRRP/HSRP setup, traffic from particular hosts is getting dropped. Ping from the host to any device through the VRRP routers fails.

Conditions: This symptom is usually seen after a VRRP/HSRP switchover. The packet drops because of some packet loop that is created between the routers running VRRP/HSRP.

Workaround: A clear of the MAC table on the new VRRP master usually restores the setup to working conditions.

* CSCtz06611

Symptoms: IPSec tunnel states are UP-IDLE because of broadcast packets that are punted to the CPU. The mac-address of VPN-SPA is not learned properly.

Conditions: This symptom is a timing issue. You may see it first time or need to try multiple times. This symptom is seen with crypto map plus vrf configuration.

 1. Reload the router with above configuration: the mac-address changes to all FF.

 2. Default the configuration of VLAN (where crypto map and engine is applied), then configure it again with old configuration. Now the mac-address will show all FF.

 3. Create the vlan. Do a no shutdown. Attach vrf. Then add crypto map to it.

Workarounds: For the steps mentioned in condition section above, below are the workarounds respectively.

Workaround 1: Remove and add “ip vrf forwarding” and then remove and add the crypto engine command.

Workaround 2: Remove and add the crypto engine command.

Workaround 3: Do a shut/no shut on the VLAN interface.

 `----- minimon 1st 64 bytes ------`

 `C00BD108:`

Conditions: This symptom may happen during a system reload.

Workaround: A power cycle is required, and the subsequent reload may not be impacted.

* CSCtz75380

Symptoms: A Cisco ASR 1000 series router sends malformed radius packets during retransmission or failover to a secondary radius server, e.g.: Cisco CAR.

ISG log if secondary radius server is installed in the network:

 `Radius-Server Log:`

 `13:23:01.011: P78: Packet received from 10.0.0.1`

 `13:23:01.011: P78: Packet successfully added`

 `13:23:01.011: P78: Parse Failed: Invalid length field - 63739 is greater than 288`

 `13:23:01.011: Log: Packet from 10.0.0.1: parse failed <unknown user>`

 `13:23:01.011: P78: Rejecting Request: packet failed to parse`

 `13:23:01.011: Log: Request from 10.0.0.1: User <unknown user> rejected`

 `(MalformedRequest).`

 `13:23:01.011: P78: Packet successfully removed`

Conditions: The issue can occur during retransmission of radius access requests or if radius packets are sent to a secondary radius server.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz76650

Symptoms: In phase 2 IPv6 DMVPN deployment, traffic for IPv6 hosts behind spokes goes via the hub.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in IPv6 DMVPN network when using phase 2 configuration and routing protocols with link-local nexthop.

Workaround: Do not use link-local nexthop routing, instead use unicast nexthops (e.g.: BGP as the routing protocol).

* CSCtz77171

Symptoms: Subscriber drops are not reported in mod4 accounting.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on checking policy-map interface for account QoS statistics on a port-channel subinterface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz78194

Symptoms: A Cisco ASR 1000 that is running Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6 or Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S crashes when negotiating multi-SA DVTI in an IPsec key engine process.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the Cisco ASR configured to receive DVTI multi-SA in aggressive mode and hitting an ISAKMP profile of a length above 31.

Workaround: Shorten the ISAKMP profile name to less than 31.

* CSCtz80643

Symptoms: A PPPoE client’s host address is installed in the LNS’s VRF routing table with the ip vrf receive vrf name command supplied either via RADIUS or in a Virtual-Template, but is not installed by CEF as attached. It is instead installed by CEF as receive, which is incorrect.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only when the Virtual-access interface is configured with the ip vrf receive vrf name command via the Virtual-Template or RADIUS profile.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz83311

Symptoms: In the bootlog, the following strings may be observed:

 `"MCB timeout"`

Occasionally these messages also are followed by a GigE port link down for any of the ports Gig 0/1-Gig 0/8. A shut/no shut may not recover the link down condition.

Conditions: This symptom happens during a system reload. It may also happen if a media-type command is issued to the first eight GigE ports.

Workaround: Do not configure “media-type rj45” for the first eight ports either at bootup time or configurations if you are using an image that does not have this fix.

* CSCtz85907

Symptoms: A Cisco 7600 should have an MVPNv4 configuration and the system replication mode as egress. Now if “address-family ipv6” is configured under the VRF definition, MVPN traffic might be affected.

Conditions: SREx and RLSx releases.

Workaround: Use ingress replication.

* CSCtz86024

Symptoms: There is a long delay in joining mcast stream with Cisco IOS 15S releases that are running on RP.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when there is no (\*,G) on the box, and the first packet for the stream creates this entry.

Workaround: With static joins we can make sure that entry is present in mroute table.

* CSCtz86747

Symptoms: Router crashes upon removing all the class-maps from policy-map.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when a route crashes while removing all user defined class-maps with live traffic.

Workaround: Shut the interface first before removing class-map.

* CSCtz86763

Symptoms: Sessions remain partially created, and memory is consumed and not returned.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when sessions are churned and reset before they reach active state.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz88289

Symptoms: It is observed that in a Cisco ME 3600-24CX unit, which is subjected to 100 consecutive image reloads, there is a system bootup hang in this area. The system stalls indefinitely and does not respond to console keystrokes like break keys.

 `<bootup snip>`

 `I2C Bus Initialization begins`

 `Margining CPU and Nile board Voltages`

 `Control FPGA Initialization begins <<<<System Hang here`

Conditions: This symptom may happen during a system bootup.

Workaround: A powercycle is required, and the next reload may not hit the above condition.

* CSCtz89608

Symptoms: A router that is operating in an ISG environment experiences a crash due to memory corruption.

Conditions: This symptom occurs within the SSS context.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz90154

Symptoms: Rapid getVPN re-registration by GM when IPsec failure occurs during initial registration. Multiple ISAKMP SAs created and deleted per second.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on a Cisco ASR 1000 that is running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(1)S or Release 15.2(1)S2 as a GM.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz90909

Symptoms: A router crashes while giving the no l2 vfi vfi-name point-to-point command.

Conditions: This symptom occurs while unconfiguring l2 vfi. The router crashes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz94188

Symptoms: With AdvancedMetroIPAccess evaluation license and with TDM permanent license xconnect under CEM, ckts are not shown and are not configurable.

Conditions: This symptom occurs under regular configuration steps.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz96342

Symptoms: Inconsistency in scaled feature license name between Cisco IOS Releases 12.2(52)EY\*/15.1(2)EY\* and Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S:

Cisco IOS Releases 12.2(52)EY\*/15.1(2)EY\* - ScaledServices

Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S - ScaledMetroAggrServices

Conditions: This symptom occurs with an upgrade from Cisco IOS Releases 12.2 (52)EY\*/15.1(2)EY\* to Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S release, which could impact the scalability feature in below ways:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If user already had permanent license before upgrade, it will now downgrade to Eval license.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) New license for installing ScaledMetroAggrServices cannot be generated as the license tool does not support this feature name.

Workaround: Upgrade to Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S1.

* CSCtz97244

Symptoms: IPSLA Video Operation with VRF support sees no packets received at responder.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when no emulate CLI is specified with the input interface.

Workaround: Use the emulate CLI to specify the input interface that has access to the VRF.

* CSCtz97755

Symptoms: ES card crash and alignment tracebacks on SP are seen.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with IPv6 unicast and multicast traffic up and running. Unconfiguring IPv6 unicast-routing will lead to this issue.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua01375

Symptoms: Certificate validation fails when CRL is not retrieved.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the router is configured to use a VRF.

Workaround: Use certificate map to revoke certificates or publish CRL to an HTTP server and configure “CDP override” to fetch the CRL.

* CSCua10377

Symptoms: A Cisco router with Circuit Emulation SPA may suffer an SPA crash.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the CE T1 circuit is configured by the end user for AT&T FDL, and the end user transmits FDL messages requesting 4- hour or 24-hour performance statistics.

Workaround: There is no workaround. If possible, contact the end user and have them reconfigure their device for ANSI FDL.

* CSCua16786

Symptoms: When a Cisco 7600 router is placed as a mid-hop-router between the first hop router (FHR) and rendezvous point (RP), with P2P GRE tunnel interface as the FHR facing interface, then PIM-registration might not get completed. The unicast PIM-registration packet might get dropped at the Cisco 7600 router.

Conditions: This symptom is seen in Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE6 and RLSx releases.

Workaround: Delete and create the FHR facing p2p tunnel interface at Cisco 7600 router, which is acting as mid-hop-rtr.

* CSCua17746

Symptoms: IKEv2 with RSA-Sig as auth session will fail.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) IKEv2 + RSA-Sig auth + ISM VPN; or

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) IKEv2 + RSA-Sig auth + 7200 with VSA.

Workaround: Disable ISM VPN or VSA or do not use IKEv2 RSA-Sig as auth.

* CSCua22599

Symptoms: MCB timeout error message is seen on console. Ports 7 and 8 do not come up.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when combo ports come up with media-type.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua30259

Symptoms: EVC egress traffic does not flow. The frames are dropped by Selene.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when SPAN is configured on service instance.

Workaround: There is no workaround.
