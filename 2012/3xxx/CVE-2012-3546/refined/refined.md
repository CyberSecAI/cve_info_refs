Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2012-3546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the FORM authenticator handles security constraint checks within Apache Tomcat and JBoss Web when used in conjunction with another component that calls `request.setUserPrincipal()` before the call to `FormAuthenticator#authenticate()`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassed Security Constraints:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass security constraint checks in the FORM authenticator.
*   **Incorrect Authentication Logic:** When `request.setUserPrincipal()` is called before `FormAuthenticator#authenticate()`, the FORM authenticator's checks are circumvented if `/j_security_check` is appended to the URL. This indicates a flaw in the order or interaction of these components.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Circumvented Authorization Controls:** A remote attacker with an authenticated session can circumvent authorization controls.
*   **Unauthorized Resource Access:** Attackers can gain access to protected resources that they are not supposed to access based on their roles within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:**  The attack is conducted over the network via specially crafted HTTP requests.
*   **URL Manipulation:** Appending `/j_security_check` to a URL is the direct method of exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Session:** The attacker must have a valid, authenticated session on the target application.
*   **Network Access:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server is required.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability occurs when a component calls `request.setUserPrincipal()` before `FormAuthenticator#authenticate()`, such as when using a Single-Sign-On valve.
*   The specific bypass is triggered when the URL ends with `/j_security_check`.
* The vulnerability exists in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.x and 6.x (and their derivative products, such as JBoss Enterprise Web Server and JBoss Enterprise Web Platform), as well as in Tomcat 5.x and 6.x.

The provided documents include various security advisories that relate to this CVE:
