```
{
  "CVE-2012-3975": {
    "Root cause": "When the DOMParser is used to parse text/html data in a Firefox extension, linked resources within this HTML data will be loaded.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource loading during HTML parsing in a privileged context."
    ],
    "Impact": "Information leakage from the loaded resources. This can potentially be combined with other attacks to become exploitable.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor could supply untrusted HTML data to a vulnerable Firefox extension, causing the extension to load linked resources.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to influence the HTML data that a Firefox extension is parsing with DOMParser."
  }
}
