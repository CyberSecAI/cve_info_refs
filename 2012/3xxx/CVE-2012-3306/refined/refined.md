- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a failure to purge passwords from the authentication cache when multi-domain support is enabled in WebSphere Application Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of cached passwords, leading to weaker than expected security.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access or perform actions they would not normally be permitted. The impact is listed as partial compromise of integrity, which could lead to unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is network-based, with a medium complexity.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker is external and does not need prior authentication.
