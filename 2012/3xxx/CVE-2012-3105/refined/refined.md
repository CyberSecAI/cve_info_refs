Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a bug in NVIDIA drivers related to how `glBufferData` handles null data. Specifically, the driver does not allocate the buffer when `glBufferData` is called with null data, deferring the allocation until actual data is uploaded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leakage:** When a buffer is not allocated as expected, and a program attempts to use it (e.g., as a vertex attribute), the driver might read from uninitialized or invalid memory. This could potentially lead to information leakage.
- **Driver Bug:** The core issue is a driver bug with the NVIDIA implementation of `glBufferData`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially use this flaw to cause an information leak. While the specific details of the information leaked are not specified, the underlying problem is that a read from uninitialized memory is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **WebGL Content:** The vulnerability is exploitable via WebGL content. If a website utilizes WebGL to allocate buffers using `glBufferData` with null data, it may trigger the vulnerability on systems with affected NVIDIA drivers.
- **Malicious Web Content:** The vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious web page loading crafted WebGL content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to load WebGL content:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver or host a crafted web page that makes calls to `glBufferData` with null data.
- **Affected NVIDIA drivers:** The target user must be using a system with the vulnerable NVIDIA driver.
- **Understanding of WebGL and GL API:** The attacker needs some technical knowledge on how to trigger the issue using the WebGL API calls.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

- **Workaround Implementation:**  Mozilla implemented a workaround by ensuring that a buffer is allocated when `glBufferData` is called, even if the data is null. This is achieved by uploading one byte at the end of the buffer.
- **Chromium Similarity:** Chrome also worked around this issue, where they explicitly allocate a large zeroed buffer.
- **Test Case:** A test case was initially available in the chromium bug report, and later attached to the bug report as a JavaScript file and an HTML file. This test case was found to crash the GPU process with the vulnerable drivers.
- **Reproducibility:**  The bug was difficult to reproduce reliably, and QA couldn't reproduce the crash using the test case. The issue might only affect specific NVIDIA driver versions.
- **Severity:**  The bug was initially considered a high-severity security issue and was fixed in Firefox 13 and Firefox ESR 10.0.5.
