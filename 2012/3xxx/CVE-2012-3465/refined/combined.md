## Synopsis

Critical: Ruby on Rails security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0154)

## Topic

Updated rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord
packages that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat
Subscription Asset Manager.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view
components. Active Record implements object-relational mapping for
accessing database entries using objects. Active Support provides support
and utility classes used by the Ruby on Rails framework.

Multiple flaws were found in the way Ruby on Rails performed XML parameter
parsing in HTTP requests. A remote attacker could use these flaws to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a Ruby on Rails application,
perform SQL injection attacks, or bypass the authentication using a
specially-created HTTP request. (CVE-2013-0156)

Red Hat is aware that a public exploit for the CVE-2013-0156 issues is
available that allows remote code execution in applications using Ruby on
Rails.

Multiple input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in
rubygem-activerecord. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to
perform an SQL injection attack against an application using
rubygem-activerecord. (CVE-2012-2661, CVE-2012-2695, CVE-2012-6496,
CVE-2013-0155)

Multiple input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in
rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to
perform an SQL injection attack against an application using
rubygem-actionpack and rubygem-activerecord. (CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in rubygem-actionpack.
A remote attacker could use these flaws to conduct XSS attacks against
users of an application using rubygem-actionpack. (CVE-2012-3463,
CVE-2012-3464, CVE-2012-3465)

A flaw was found in the HTTP digest authentication implementation in
rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
denial of service of an application using rubygem-actionpack and digest
authentication. (CVE-2012-3424)

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated rubygem-actionpack,
rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord packages, which resolve
these issues. Katello must be restarted ("service katello restart") for
this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=847200#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-08-10 05:17:49 UTC  ```  The Ruby on Rails project reports:  XSS Vulnerability in strip_tags  There is a vulnerability in the strip_tags helper of Ruby on Rails which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2012-3465](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3465).  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       Applications not using strip_tags Fixed Versions:     3.2.8, 3.1.8, 3.0.17  Impact - ------ There is an XSS vulnerability in the strip_tags helper in Ruby on Rails, the helper doesn't correctly handle malformed html.  As a result an attacker can execute arbitrary javascript through the use of specially crafted malformed html.  All users who rely on strip_tags for XSS protection should upgrade or use the work around immediately.  Releases - -------- The 3.2.8 and 3.1.8 releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds - ----------- For users running earlier releases we have provided a work around, place the attached file into the config/initializers directory of your application.  Patches - ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-0-strip_tags.patch - Patch for 3.0 series * 3-1-strip_tags.patch - Patch for 3.1 series * 3-2-strip_tags.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.

could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript. This

vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2012-3465.

Versions Affected: All.

Not affected: Applications not using strip\_tags

Fixed Versions: 3.2.8, 3.1.8, 3.0.17

Impact

------

There is an XSS vulnerability in the strip\_tags helper in Ruby on Rails,

the helper doesn't correctly handle malformed html. As a result an

attacker can execute arbitrary javascript through the use of specially

crafted malformed html. All users who rely on strip\_tags for XSS

protection should upgrade or use the work around immediately.

Releases

--------

The 3.2.8, 3.0.17 and 3.1.8 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds

-----------

For users running earlier releases we have provided a work around, place

the attached file into the config/initializers directory of your

application.

Patches

-------

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided

patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format

and consist of a single changeset.

\* 3-0-strip\_tags.patch - Patch for 3.0 series

\* 3-1-strip\_tags.patch - Patch for 3.1 series

\* 3-2-strip\_tags.patch - Patch for 3.2 series

Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at

present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade

as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of

security fixes for unsupported releases.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=847199#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-08-10 05:11:37 UTC  ``` The Ruby on Rails project reports:  There is a vulnerability in the HTML escaping code in Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2012-3464](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3464).  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None Fixed Versions:     3.2.8, 3.1.8, 3.0.17  Impact - ------ The HTML escaping code in Ruby on Rails does not escape all potentially dangerous characters.  In particular the code does not escape the single quote character.  The helpers used in Rails itself never use single quotes, so most applications are unlikely to be vulnerable, however all users running an affected release should still upgrade.  Releases - -------- The 3.2.8 and 3.1.8 releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds - -----------  For users on earlier releases or who are unable to upgrade, you can install the attached file into config/initializers.  This will upgrade the rails helper to use the Rack::Utils.escape_html helper which does escape the single quote character.  However the Rack helper also escapes the '/' character, this is likely to cause test failures if your application is expecting the values of URLs to be unencoded. These tests however browsers will correctly decode the values and function as expected.  Patches - ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-0-escape_html.patch - Patch for 3.0 series * 3-1-escape_html.patch - Patch for 3.1 series * 3-2-escape_html.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=889649#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-12-22 07:43:27 UTC  ```  This issue was found on the Phenoelit Blog:  An authlogic cookie usually uses a database stored token to identify the user. The relevant parts of the session cookie are:      user_credentials_id - a numeric value which is used with "User.find_by_id()"     user_credentials - a radom string which will be compared with the database field "persistence_token" in the Users table  Due to the way the RoR "find_by_*" methods are defined the following SQL injection a-like issue arises:  > User.find_by_id({:select =>"* from users limit 1 --"})   User Load (0.5ms)  SELECT * from users limit 1 -- FROM "users" WHERE "users"."id" IS NULL LIMIT 1  => #<User id: 1, [... all the fun stuff]  By knowing this behaviour we can now easily circumvent the authlogic protection with the knowledge of the "secret_token". The following cookie would give you access to an authlogic protected application:  {    "session_id" => "41414141",    "user_credentials"=>"Phenoelit",   "user_credentials_id"=>{      :select=> " *,\"Phenoelit\" as persistence_token from Users -- "   } }  Last man standing would then be devise/warden, which works similar to authlogic but is not exploitable in that way described above.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2012-5664](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-5664).  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       NONE. Fixed Versions:     3.2.10, 3.1.9, 3.0.18  Impact ------ Due to the way dynamic finders in Active Record extract options from method parameters, a method parameter can mistakenly be used as a scope.  Carefully crafted requests can use the scope to inject arbitrary SQL.  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  Impacted code passes user provided data to a dynamic finder like this:    Post.find_by_id(params[:id])  Releases -------- The  3.2.10, 3.1.9 & 3.0.18 releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds ----------- The issue can be mitigated by explicitly converting the parameter to an expected value.  For example, change this:    Post.find_by_id(params[:id])  to this:    Post.find_by_id(params[:id].to_s)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=889649#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2013-01-03 03:28:24 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-rails tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 891468](show_bug.cgi?id=891468 "CLOSED ERRATA -
