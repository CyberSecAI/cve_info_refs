### Resolved Bugs—Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2)S2

* CSCsv74508

Symptom: If a linecard is reset (either due to an error or a command such as hw-module slot reload) at the precise time an SNMP query is trying to communicate with that linecard, the RP could reset due to a CPU vector 400 error.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the linecard is reset (either due to error or a command such as hw-module slot reload) at the precise time an SNMP query is received.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtd45679

Symptom: The standby supervisor reloads after removing an IPSLA probe via CLI:

R7600(config)#no ip sla 1 R7600(config)# 06:53:31: Config Sync: Line-by-Line sync verifying failure on command: no ip sla 1 due to parser return error

06:53:31: rf\_reload\_peer\_stub: RP sending reload request to Standby. User: Config-Sync, Reason: Configuration mismatch R7600(config)# 06:53:31: %RF-SP-5-RF\_RELOAD: Peer reload. Reason: Proxy request to reload peer R7600(config)# 06:53:31: %OIR-SP-3-PWRCYCLE: Card in module 6, is being power-cycled (RF request) R7600(config)# 06:53:32: %PFREDUN-SP-6-ACTIVE: Standby processor removed or reloaded, changing to Simplex mode R7600(config)#

Conditions: This issue only occurs if the probe is configured via SNMP.

Workaround: Remove the probe via SNMP.

More Info: This issue is applicable to a Cisco Catalyst 6500 platform running Cisco IOS 12.2SX releases. It may also affect other high availability (HA) platforms running Cisco IOS 12.2 or 15.X releases.

* CSCtz90697

Symptoms: EIGRP authentication is not working.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when authentication is configured with key-id 0.

Workaround: Use any other key-id for authentication.

* CSCua18166

Symptoms: When sub appid is triggered by end points, the network does not recognize it and displays it as “Unknown identifier”.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the limitation results in not supporting traffic classification based on sub appid.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua60785

Symptoms: Metadata class-map matches only the first of the following filter, if present, in a class map (the other media-type matches are skipped):

match application attribute [category, sub-category, media-type, device-class] value-string match application application-group value-string

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the class map has the aforementioned filters.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub04965

Symptom: Multiple symptoms may occur including the following:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Multiple sessions established to TACACS+ server which never clear are seen in the output of show tcp brief.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Pings to the loopback address from directly connected equipment suffers packet loss.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Traffic and pings through the switch suffers packet loss.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) CPU utilization remained stable and below 10% when the issue was occurring, the interface counters were not reporting any errors or drops.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) TACACS+ authentication errors, authorization errors, or accounting errors.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) SSH/TELNET via VTY not accessible.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If condition exists for a period of time the switch may stop passing traffic.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the device is configured with TACACS+. It is seen mostly on Cisco 3750/3760 switches, but has been observed on Cisco 6500 switches.

Workaround:

 1. Remove the AAA and TACACS+ server configuration.

 2. Clear the existing TCP connections with clear tcp tcb.

 3. Reconfigure the TACACS+ server configuration to use "single-connection" mode.

 4. Reconfigure the AAA configuration.

Mitigation using EEM: A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect a hung, extended, or indefinite TCP connection that causes the symptoms to be observed. The policy allows administrators to monitor TCP connections on a Cisco IOS device. When Cisco IOS EEM detects hung or stale TCP connections, the policy can trigger a response by sending a syslog message or a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap to clear the TCP connection. The example policy provided in this document is based on a Tcl script that monitors and parses the output from two commands at defined intervals, produces a syslog message when the monitor threshold reaches its configured value, and can reset the TCP connection. The EEM script is available at:

 <https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19344>

* CSCub56842

Symptoms: The router stops passing IPsec traffic after some time.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the show crypto eli command output shows that during every IPsec P2 rekey, the active IPsec-Session count increases, which does not correlate to the max IPsec counters displayed in SW.

Workaround: Reload the router before active sessions reach the max value.

To verify, do as follows:

router#sh cry eli

CryptoEngine Onboard VPN details: state = Active Capability : IPPCP, DES, 3DES, AES, GCM, GMAC, IPv6, GDOI, FAILCLOSE, HA

IPSec-Session : 7855 active, 8000 max, 0 failed <<<

* CSCub95285

Symptoms: No logging messages are seen when configuring the syslog server in CLI mode until configuration mode is exited. However when unconfiguring the syslog server, syslog messages will appear within configuration mode.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when, in CLI configuration mode, you enter the following command:

Router(config)#logging host 1.2.3.4 transport tcp

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc03258

Symptom: Router crash due to IPC timeout during registering ICC request port.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the router, which is in RPR mode, is reloaded. The active starts booting up as the standby and crashes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc11958

Symptom: 7600-SIP-400 linecard crash seen with SPA reload.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with an SPA reload.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc22651

Symptom: A router may experience a crash in the “BGP Task” process during best path selection. In a rare corner case, when the last two remaining multipaths are deleted around the same time by two different threads of execution, a null pointer exception can be raised in the “BGP Task” process.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a BGP multipath is configured as shown in the following example:

address-family ipv4 maximum-paths ibgp 4

Workaround: Disable BGP multipath.

* CSCuc51879

Symptom: Traffic loss occurs on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers during an RP SSO switchover.

Conditions: This symptom occurs during an RP SSO switchover on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc65662

Symptom: Router crashes while configuring xconnect after traffic over SAToP over UDP.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you send traffic using SAToP over UDP. After that try to configure SAToP over MPLS and router crashes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc85638

Symptom: Ethernet CFM and ELMI interworking. If CFM is configured on xconnect and interworking with ELMI, incorrect EVC state may be reported to ELMI on MPLS configuration changes.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) CFM configured on xconnect EFP.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ELMI configured on same interface.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) CFM-ELMI interworking enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud55286

Symptoms: Traffic drops for sometime after doing a switchover.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when a switchover is performed on a Cisco ASR 903.

Workaround: Put a neighbor command where the neighbor has no meaning and will never be up. This will solve the timing issue.

* CSCud58457

Symptom: Standby interface stays UP/UP after a reload:

BGL.S.15-ASR1004-1#sh int des Interface Status Protocol Description Te0/0/0 down down Te0/1/0 up up Te0/2/0 down down Te0/3/0 up up Gi0 admin down down

It should be like this :

BGL.S.15-ASR1004-1#sh int des Interface Status Protocol Description Te0/0/0 down down Te0/1/0 up up Te0/2/0 down down Te0/3/0 standby mode down Gi0 admin down down

Conditions: The symptom is observed when “backup interface” and “carrier-delay” are configured under the interface:

interface TenGigabitEthernet0/1/0 backup interface TenGigabitEthernet0/3/0 ip address 10.163.137.29 255.255.255.224 logging event link-status carrier-delay up 1 carrier-delay down msec 0 cdp enable hold-queue 4096 in hold-queue 4096 out ! interface TenGigabitEthernet0/3/0 mac-address d867.d9dd.ff10 no ip address logging event link-status carrier-delay up 1 carrier-delay down msec 0 cdp enable hold-queue 4096 in hold-queue 4096 out !

Workaround: Flap the standby interface.

* CSCud58613

Symptom: Egress HQF policy needs to be blocked for MLPPP/MFR member links. Ingress HQF policy application needs to be blocked for MLPPP/MFR bundles without member links. Ingress HQF policy needs to be enabled for Gige subinterfaces and EVCs.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with HQF policy.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud96854

Symptom: Standby RSP crashes while unconfiguring interfaces on ACR controller.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when using a TCLSH script to teardown 450 CEM CKTs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue09385

Symptom: Active RP crash during sessions bring up after clearing PDP.

Conditions: The symptom is observed after clearing PDP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

More Info: This is a negative test where DHCP IP under APN on IWAG is the access interface IP. In real world, we do not configure access interface IP as a DHCP IP for an APN.

* CSCue45934

Symptoms: This problem is specific to the Catalyst 6000 platform. With IPv4 crypto map, ICMP echo reply is not triggered from the remote end.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in IPv4 crypto map configuration and Catalyst 6000 platform.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue57495

Symptom: Traceback is observed with error message “standby cannot allocate VLAN for Tunnel Rsvd Vlan”.

Conditions: The issue seen while configuring L2VPN and L3VPN with scaled tunnel configurations.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue59592

Symptom: Multiple crashes observed with the following tracebacks after upgrading the Cisco IOS Release from 12.2(33)SRC1 to 12.2(33)SRE6:

\*Jul 27 01:39:33 SUM: %SCHED-3-SEMLOCKED: CMFI RP process attempted to lock a semaphore, already locked by itself -Traceback= 87807BC 999A314 9E1684C 9E17E4C 9E18074 AA9B25C AA9B2C8 AAAA270 A1D33B4 A1D3474 A1D61A4 A1D14B0 AAC8A28 9E1909C 9E19F1C 9E1D4FC \*Jul 27 01:39:33 SUM: %SCHED-3-SEMLOCKED: CMFI RP process attempted to lock a semaphore, already locked by itself -Traceback= 87807BC 999A314 9E1684C 9E17E4C 9E18074 AA9B25C AA9B2C8 AAAA270 A1D33B4 A1D3474 A1D61A4 A1D14B0 AAC8A28 9E1909C 9E19F1C 9E1D4FC \*Jul 27 01:39:33 SUM: %SCHED-3-SEMLOCKED: CMFI RP process attempted to lock a semaphore, already locked by itself -Traceback= 87807BC 999A314 9E1684C 9E17E4C 9E18074 AA9B25C AA9B2C8 AAAA270 A1D33B4 A1D3474 A1D61A4 A1D14B0 AAC8A28 9E1909C 9E19F1C 9E1D4FC

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a combination of BGP VPNv4 prefixes + PBR enabled on the interface for the VRF and during upgrade of image or reload of the device. If “mls mpls recirc agg” is enabled in global mode, then this crash will not be observed.

Workaround: Enable “mls mpls recirc agg” in global mode.

* CSCue68761

Symptoms: A leak in small buffer is seen at ip\_mforward in Cisco IOS Release 15.1(4)M3. Device: Cisco 2911 Cisco IOS: c2900-universalk9-mz.SPA.151-4.M3.bin

* CSCue74612

Symptom: FTP download fails in FTS client.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with FTS transfer over FTP via VRF.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue75986

Symptom: The active route processor crashes because of a segmentation fault in the PIM IPv6 process after de-configuring a VRF.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when BGP, multicast-routing, or a VRF is de-configured while VRF-forwarding for the affected VRF is still configured on some interfaces and IPv6 multicast state entries exist within the affected VRF.

Workaround: Before removing a VRF using no vrf definition xxx, de-configuring “router bgp...” or de-configuring multicast-routing for any VRF or for the global routing table, de-configure the IPv6 and the IPv4 MDT tunnels for affected VRFs as follows:

 1. Under the “vrf definition...”/”address-family ipv6” configuration sub-mode, execute no mdt default....

 2. Under the “vrf definition...”/”address-family ipv4” configuration sub-mode, execute no mdt default....

* CSCue76057

Symptom: On a SIP 400 with gigeV2 SPA, when EVC is configured with “encap default”, it is seen that sometimes the FUGU TCAM is not programmed with correct VVID for the EVC. This results in incoming traffic reaching the linecard with wrong VVID. This can impact traffic incoming on the EVC.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with an “encap default” configuration under EVC, or removal and re-application of “encap default” under EVC.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue76102

Symptoms: Redistributed internal IPv6 routes from v6 IGP into BGP are not learned by the BGP neighboring routers.

Conditions: This symptom occurs because of a software issue, due to which the internal IPv6 redistributed routes from IGPs into BGP are not advertised correctly to the neighboring routers, resulting in the neighbors dropping these IPv6 BGP updates in inbound update processing. The result is that the peering routers do not have any such IPv6 routes in BGP tables from their neighbors.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue79748

Symptom: When the system is under scaling conditions, and you issue the shut then no shut commands on the access interface, the IOSd process may crash.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the system is under scaling conditions, and you issue the shut then no shut commands on the access interface.

Workaround: Do not issue shut then no shut on the access interface when the system has traffic running and the device is under load.

* CSCuf09198

Symptom: After deleting a VRF, you are unable to reconfigure the VRF.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when BGP SAFI 129 address-family is not configured, but unicast routes are installed into multicast RIB to serve as upstream multicast hop, as described in RFC 6513. This applies to VRFs configured before BGP is configured.

Workaround: Beyond unconfiguring BGP, there is no workaround once the issue occurs. Configuring a dummy VRF multicast address-family under BGP before the issue occurs can prevent the problem from occurring.

* CSCuf30798

Symptom: SIP 600 crashes.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with VPLS VC going over GRE tunnel and chassis having both ES+ and SIP 600 card.

Workaround: Remove VPLS over GRE. This configuration is not supported.

* CSCuf56776

Symptom: After a linecard is removed and reinserted (OIR), traffic may fail to pass through some virtual circuits which have been configured for pseudowire redundancy.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the first segment ID in the redundancy group is numerically greater than the second segment.

PE1#show ssm id | inc 1st 1stMem: 16394 2ndMem: 12301 ActMem: 12301 1stMem: 16394 2ndMem: 12301 ActMem: 12301

After the OIR is performed, it can be seen that the segments are reversed on the linecard.

ESM-20G-12#sh ssm id | inc 1st 1stMem: 12301 2ndMem: 16394 ActMem: 12301 1stMem: 12301 2ndMem: 16394 ActMem: 12301

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf62756

Symptom: If bandwidth qos-reference value is configured on an interface which bandwidth can change, then the actual interface bandwidth will be used for QoS service-policy validation when the interface bandwidth changes. This can result in a service-policy being removed if the interface bandwidth is insufficient to meet the requirements of the service-policy, such as bandwidth guarantees.

Conditions: Affects variable-bandwidth interfaces such as EFM interfaces or PPP multilink bundles.

Workaround 1: Use proportional actions in the QoS service-policy, such as “police rate percent....”, “bandwidth remaining ratio...”, “bandwidth remaining percent...”, and “priority percent”.

Workaround 2: You can configure bandwidth qos-reference with maximum bandwidth of the interface:

interface Ethernet0 bandwidth qos-reference <max bandwidth of interface>

This can prevent policy-map detached due to interface bandwidth change.

* CSCuf68995

Symptom: Ping failures. Traffic gets dropped.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you configure MPLSoMGRE tunnel on PE1 and PE2. Initiate ping from CE1 to CE2. Packets reach the CE2 and replay is coming back but these packets are getting dropped on PE2. After PE2 switchover, ping fails from CE1 to CE2. PE2 is configured with MPLSoMGRE on an HA system. Topology:

CE1---- PE1 ----PE2----CE2

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf82179

Symptom: BGP routes remain installed in multicast RIB even after “address-family” configuration has been removed from “vrf definition”.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in MVPN topology, where the stale routes are installed as an upstream multicast hop, as described in RFC:  <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6513>

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug04187

Symptom: Build breakage.

Conditions: This symptom occurs due to CSCuf62756.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug17724

Symptom: When using session protection and graceful restart for LDP, LDP neighbor goes down immediately after filtering LDP hello between routers. The LDP neighbor should go down after 10 minutes (default value of forwarding state holding time for GR).

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you enable session protection and graceful restart for LDP

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug17808

Symptom: Redistributed default route not advertised to EIGRP peer.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when Cisco ASR router is rebooted or the route is cleared via the clear ip route command, the route disappears form the spokes.

Workaround: Clearing the EIGRP Neighborship restores the route on the spokes.

* CSCug23348

Symptom: The “mod” value in the SSRAM may be inconsistent to the number of ECMP paths.

Conditions: This occurs with ECMP TE tunnels with tunnel mpls traffic-eng load-share value commands configured.

Workaround: Remove the tunnel mpls traffic-eng load-share value commands from the TE tunnels.

* CSCug24114

Symptom: CTS environment-data download fails from ISE.

Conditions: The symptom is observed if there is less PAC and environment-data refresh timer is configured in ISE. After multiple refreshes of PAC and environment data and the switch is reloaded, sometimes a CTS environment-data download fails from ISE on the switch.

Workaround: Unconfigure pac key CLI and configure it again as below:

no pac key pac key <key-id>

* CSCug31561

A vulnerability in the DHCP implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.

The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of crafted DHCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DHCP packets to an affected device that has the DHCP server or DHCP relay feature enabled. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds to this vulnerability.

Workaround: Avoid issuing the clear xconnect all command.

* CSCug50208

Symptom: A crash is seen due to double free of memory.

Conditions: The symptom is seen when the accept interface VLAN goes down.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug50340

Symptom: PW traffic is not flowing after SSO/card reset the active PTF card.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. Create a unprotected tunnel between the active PTF card and create a PW.

 2. Apply the table map. Bi-directional traffic is flowing fine.

 3. SSO/reset the active PTF card in node 106 (4/1).

 4. Now tunnel core port is in standby card.

 5. Observed bi-directional traffic is not flowing once the card becomes up.

 6. Again reset the active PTF card (5/4).

 7. Observe uni-directional traffic only is flowing.

Workaround: Delete the PW and recreate it again. However, note that if you do an SSO/card reset, the issue reappears.

* CSCug52119

Symptom: A RIB route is present for a prefix, but the router continues to LISP encapsulate.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when a LISP map-cache existed for a prefix and then the RIB route was added later.

Workaround: Use the following command:

clear ip/ipv6 lisp map-cache <prefix>

* CSCug58617

Symptom: Usernames do not show up in CCP Express. Username shows up on a router with default configuration.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on routers with configurations that break show runn | format.

Workaround: Use default configuration.

* CSCug59746

Symptom: A crash is seen on the RP in the SS manager process:

Exception to IOS Thread: Frame pointer 0x7F58BB22FE80, PC = 0x7C505FB

UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = SSS Manager -Traceback= 1#980611ad3b9665cd80fe5178bcd6036a :400000+78505FB :400000+7C68774 :400000+7C6871A :400000+1C13522 :400000+7852194 :400000+78512C8 :400000+7C68774 :400000+7C6871A :400000+33A8AC1 :400000+77DD92F :400000+33C3E4C :400000+33AFE89 :400000+33B2564 :400000+7824301 :400000+7823F37 :400000+77FA27F

Conditions: The issue appears to be related to NAS port. It looks like a key is being set when the issue occurred. The exact conditions are still being investigated.

Workaround: Possibly remove radius or more specifically, NAS port configurations. This still needs to be verified.

* CSCug68193

Symptom: Multicast traffic across ES+ cards stop flowing across subinterfaces.

Conditions: The symptom is observed after a linecard OIR. After the linecard comes up, multicast traffic stops flowing across subinterfaces.

Workaround: Shut/no shut the subinterface.

* CSCug69107

Symptom: Crypto session does not comes up in EZVPN.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when a Crypto session is being established.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug72891

Symptom: EIGRP neighbor flaps due to EIGRP SIA. Troubleshooting shows that a race condition causes EIGRP successor loop first and it leads to EIGRP QUERY loop resulting in the neighbor flaps.

Conditions: The issue is observed when a worse metric update is received from the successor, once the route is already in active state, in a partially peered multiaccess network.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug79857

Symptom: Router crash is seen.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you issue the following command:

show ip subscriber mac e01d.3b70.108e

Workaround: Do show ip subscriber mac e01d.3b70.108e only for the sessions in connected state, i.e.: sessions should not be in “Attempting” state in sh sss sess | i mac address.

* CSCug83238

Symptom: TE Tunnel constantly performs signalling attempts instead of holding down the path option, which causes CPU to become very busy.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Configuration of multiple verbatim explicit path options.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Path error during LSP signalling.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug94275

Symptom: ES+ card crashes with an unexpected exception to CPU: vector 200, PC = 0x0.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on the ES+ series linecards on a Cisco 7600 series router. Symptom is reported on the ES+ console and in the crashinfo file on the ES+ flash disk. It is not reported in the syslog.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh07657

Symptom: Inter-AS/Aggregate label is not re-originated after the directly connected CE facing interface (in VRF) is shut down.

Conditions: Inter-AS MPLS VPN set-up with Cisco 7600(PE)Router running on Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE4.

Workaround: Downgrade to Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE3 or earlier.

* CSCuh09412

Symptom: A Cisco ASR 1000 running ISG with “radius-proxy session-restart” crashes when WiFi clients are roaming between hotspots.

Conditions: The symptom is observed if a client roams between WiFi access points and the accounting-stop message from the initial access point does not reach the ISG where the subscriber session is active as can sometimes be the case of roaming between access points on a wireless LAN controller.

Workaround: Disable “radius-proxy session-restart” and reload the chassis to clear the session-cache.

* CSCuh14012

Symptom: The crypto session remains UP-ACTIVE after tunnels are brought down administratively.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in tunnels with the same IPsec profile with a shared keyword.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh16115

Symptom: With VPLS configuration with IP-FRR, on doing multiple churns SP/LC may crash.

Conditions: The issue occurs when xconnect internal data structre is to be freed up and IP FRR is still pointing to it.

Workaround: Remove IP-FRR configuration before unprovisioning xconnect.

* CSCuh16927

Symptom: Mac entries learned on a trunk link are flushed after removing VLANs.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when some allowed VLANs are removed on a trunk link, all mac address entries learned on this link are flushed. This is issue is specific to extended VLAN IDs.

Workaround: Executing ping to destination IP after removing VLANs will recover this condition.

* CSCuh24040

Symptom: BGP routes are not marked Stale and considered best routes even though the BGP session with the peer is torn down. A hard or soft reset of the BGP peering session does not help.

For BFD-related triggering, the following messages are normally produced with the BGP-5-ADJCHANGE message first, and the BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE message second. Under normal conditions, the two messages will have identical timestamps. When this problem is seen, the order of the messages will be reversed, with the BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE message appearing first, and with a slightly different timestamp from the BGP-5-ADJCHANGE message. In the problem case, the BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE message will also include the string “NSF peer closed the session”

For example when encountering this bug, you would see:

May 29 18:16:24.414: %BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor x.x.x.x IPv4 Unicast vpn vrf VRFNAME topology base removed from session NSF peer closed the session May 29 18:16:24.526: %BGP-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor x.x.x.x vpn vrf VRFNAME Down BFD adjacency down

Instead of:

May 29 18:16:24.354: %BGP-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor x.x.x.x vpn vrf VRFNAME Down BFD adjacency down May 29 18:16:24.354: %BGP\_SESSION-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor x.x.x.x IPv4 Unicast vpn vrf VRFNAME topology base removed from session BFD adjacency down

Log messages associated for non-BFD triggers are not documented.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when BGP graceful restart is used in conjunction with BFD, but it is possible (but very low probability) for it to happen when BGP graceful restart processing happens when any other type of BGP reset (eg: clear command) is in progress.

Affected configurations all include: router bgp ASN... bgp graceful-restart...

The trigger is that BGP exceeds its CPU quantum during the processing of a reset, and gives up the CPU, and then BGP Graceful Restart processing runs before BGP can complete its reset processing. This is a very low probability event, and triggering it is going to be highly dependent on the configuration of the router, and on BGP’s CPU requirements.

It is not possible to trigger this bug unless BGP graceful-restart is configured.

Workaround: If you are engaged in active monitoring of router logs, and the bug is being triggered by a BFD-induced reset, you can detect this situation by watching for the reversal of log message order described in the Symptoms section, and then take manual steps to remedy this problem when it occurs.

On the problematic router, issue no neighbor <xxx> activate command under the proper address-family will clear the stale routes.

The other option is to manually shutdown the outgoing interface which marks the routes as “inaccessible” and hence not been used anymore. This prevents the traffic blackhole but the routes will stay in the BGP table.

More Info: This bug affects all releases where CSCsk79641 or CSCtn58128 is integrated. Releases where neither of those fixes is integrated are not affected.

* CSCuh27770

Symptom: On a dual-RP system which is configured for stateful switchover (SSO), some VPLS virtual circuits may fail to be provisioned on the standby route processor.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the VFI consists of VLAN interfaces that are also configured for IP.

Workaround: Reload the standby RP.

* CSCuh43252

Symptom: After upgrading to Cisco IOS Release 15.0(2)SE3, you can no longer authenticate using TACACS. The TPLUS process on the switch will be pushing the CPU up to 99%.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you use TACACS for authentication.

Workaround: Downgrade the switch to a version prior to 15.0(2)SE3.

* CSCuh48666

Symptom: Router crashes and reloads with dynamic EID scaling.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with dynamic EID scaling.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuh63997

Symptom: Router crashes when service-policy is installed on the interface.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with service-policies having random-detect aggregate configuration.

Workaround: Use non-aggregate random-detect for WRED configurations. If the platform supports only aggregate random-detect, then there cannot be a workaround other than not using the WRED configuration altogether.

### Resolved Bugs—Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2)S1

* CSCtq26296

Symptom: Router crashes with DLFI configurations.

Conditions: The symptom is observed while doing a shut/no shut.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCts60458

Symptom: There is a memory leak in PfR MIB.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when PfR is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtx50235

Symptom: During a crash on the Cisco Catalyst 6500, the normal crash information from the crashinfo files may be missing due to the crashes showing the Routing processor (RP) being reset by the Switching Processor (SP) and the RP crashinfo also showing the RP being reset by the SP. This bug addresses this serviceability issue and it has nothing to do with the root cause of the crash itself.

In a majority of cases, the crash has been a single-event crash and has not repeated.

Conditions: Conditions of this symptom are not known currently. At this point, it is believed that the real fault of the crash belongs to the SP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty59423

Symptom: Memory leak seen with following messages:

Alternate Pool: None Free: 0 Cause: No Alternate pool -Process= "VOIP\_RTCP", ipl= 0, pid= 299 -Traceback= 0x25B1F0Cz 0x25AB6CBz 0x25B1029z 0x46C02Ez 0x46C89Bz 0x46BCC2z 0x471D12z 0x43EF59Ez 0x43DD559z 0x43DCF90z %SYS-2-MALLOCFAIL: Memory allocation of 780 bytes failed from 0x46C02E, alignment 32

Conditions: The conditions are unknown.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz53214

Symptom: The “clear counter pseudowire <#>” commands do not clear the pseudowire specific counters.

Conditions: This symptom is reported to be present in all Cisco IOS Release 15.X(S) versions.

Workaround: Issuing global clear count (“clear counters”) will clear counters including pseudowire specific counters.

* CSCua76157

Symptom: BGP routes are displayed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after removing the “send-label” from PE.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub40547

Symptom: ES+ module is crashing with “%NP\_DEV-DFC1-2-WATCHDOG: Watchdog detected on NP 0” error.

Conditions: The issue is specific to the type of packet and its content which is unique when vidmon is configured.

Workaround: Remove vidmon configuration.

* CSCub93937

Symptom: PfR “OER border router” process might report exception and the router reloads under stress traffic.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a PfR configuration with scaling traffic-class actively, and stress control traffic between PfR MC and BRs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub95365

Symptom: An ES+ crashes upon the dynamic addition/deletion of class-maps.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the dynamic addition/deletion of class-maps of a policy applied in scale number of PC EVCs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc23542

Symptom: The PXE client network boot fails when an ME3600 running 152-4.S is the DHCP relay agent.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the ME3600 changes the option 54 “DHCP Server Identifier” address to its own IP address in the DHCP offer received from the PXE DHCP server. This causes the client to send the PXE boot request (port 4011) to the ME3600 instead of the PXE server.

Workaround: Downgrade ME3600 to Cisco IOS Release 15.1(2)EY.

* CSCuc59858

Symptom: Valid dynamic authorization requests which are not retransmissions are marked as retransmission.

Conditions: This may occur when valid dynamic authorization requests with the same RADIUS packet identifier is sent from different source ports.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc60297

Symptom: Redistribute or source (network statement) VRF route into BGP. BGP VRF prefix with next hop from global, the next-hop will be inaccessible.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when redistribute VRF routes into BGP with global NH.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud05497

Symptom: Rarely, the WCM fails to send the configuration to a WaasExpress device.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when CM tries to send the configuration to a WaasExpress device. Rarely, the “SSL peer shutdown incorrectly” error is seen, leading to failure to send the configuration.

Workaround: Go to any WAAS-EXP configuration page and click submit.

* CSCud11078

Symptom: Removal of the service instance on the target device causes a crash.

Conditions: Not consistently reproducible on all configurations as the underlying cause is a race condition.

Workaround: De-schedule the probe before removing the service instance.

* CSCud11627

Symptom: SUP720 supervisor module may hang in ROMMON after the module reset triggered by TM\_DATA\_PARITY\_ERROR.

Conditions: The issue is observed after a module reset triggered by TM\_DATA\_PARITY\_ERROR.

Workaround: Power off/power on the router.

* CSCud22038

Symptom: When a PC is moved between two VLAN ports (on one port, ISG is enabled and the other port is non-ISG) several times by its LAN cable connection on the L2SW that is connected to the Cisco ASR 1000 router, the PC is unable to receive DHCP OFFER due to the wrong VLAN ID from the DHCP server on the Cisco ASR 1000 router.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud24806

Symptom: Compared to V1 ATM SPA, V2 SPAs are having more latency and bad bandwidth partition.

Conditions: The symptom is observed under the following conditions:

 1. V2 SPA configured in L3 QoS mode.

 2. Policy map contains “no priority queue”.

 3. Policy map has more than one QoS class.

 4. Each class has a WRED profile configured.

Workaround: While using a policy-map with a WRED profile, use the drop-probability value as 8. This improves the partition.

* CSCud31618

Symptom: DHCP client is not getting an IP address.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with an interface change like this:

 1. Create one l2-connected single stack unclassified-mac IPv4 session on interface g0/2/1 using ping from client with mac 000a.000b.000c.

 2. Do an interface-change with DHCP session (i.e.: send DHCP discover with same mac 000a.000b.000c on other interface g0/2/2.100).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud34711

Symptom: After multiple VRF transfers, the session goes down (i.e.: VRF transfer from global VRF to VRF2 then to VRF1).

Conditions: The symptom is observed with multiple VRF transfers.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud41058

Symptom: There is a route-map which matches tags and set a new value. This route-map is used in an EIGRP outbound distribute list. One in 10 times based on the received route tag, the correct route tag value is not set while advertising out.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you use a route map which matches tags and sets a new tag. Used in distribute-list route-map name out.

Workaround: Clear the EIGRP process or re-advertise the route.

* CSCud64870

Symptom: DMVPN hub ASR 1004 may crash after the fetching CRL from MS CRL server.

Conditions: The crash occurs when there are five CDPs for the hub router to fetch the CRL. Since there are multiple CDPs, the hub router fetches the CRL in a parallel way, which leads to a crash under a timing issue.

Workaround: Setting up one CDP instead of multiple CDPs will greatly reduce the timing condition that leads to the crash.

* CSCud70629

Symptom: Incremental memory leaks are seen at IPSec background process.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with "clear nhrp cache".

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud71773

Symptom: The cost-minimization test command is not accepted.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the cost-minimization test command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud79067

Symptom: The BGP MIB reply to a getmany query is not lexicographically sorted.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when IPv4 and IPv6 neighbor IP addresses are lexicographically intermingled, for example, 1.1.1.1, 0202::02, 3.3.3.3.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCud86954

Symptom: Some flows are not added to the Flexible Netflow cache, as indicated by the “Flows not added” counter increasing in the show flow monitor statistics command output. “Debug flow monitor packets” shows “FNF\_BUILD: Lost cache entry” messages, and after some time, all cache entries are lost. At that moment, debug starts showing “FLOW MON: ip input feature builder failed on interface couldn’t get free cache entry”, and no new entries are created and exported (“Current entries” counter remains at 0).

The following is sample output when all cache entries are lost:

Router#sh flow monitor FNF-MON stat

 Cache type: Normal

 Cache size: 4096

 Current entries: 0

 High Watermark: 882

 Flows added: 15969

 Flows not added: 32668

 Flows aged: 15969

 - Active timeout ( 1800 secs) 0

 - Inactive timeout ( 15 secs) 15969

 - Event aged 0

 - Watermark aged 0

 - Emergency aged 0

Conditions: This symptom occurs when all of the following are true:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Flexible Netflow is enabled on a DMVPN tunnel interface.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Local policy-based routing is also enabled on the router.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Local PBR references an ACL that does not exist or an ACL that matches IPsec packets.

Workaround:

 1. Make sure that the ACL used in the local PBR route-map exists and does not match IPsec packets sent over the DMVPN tunnel interface.

 2. Disabling encryption on the tunnel interface, or changing tunnel mode from mGRE to GRE also removes this bug.

 3. The issue will not be seen if FNF is not configured, or if FNF is configured but is not monitoring VPN traffic.

* CSCud99501

Symptom: There is a LISP control process crash when unconfiguring.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you unconfigure LISP.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue05358

Symptom: “Collect Identifier mac-address” -- for routed session is not working for the client who roams to a new interface.

Conditions: This symptom is observed if the subscriber already has a session available in Interface 1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue05927

Symptom: OTV ISIS adjacency keeps going down/up every ten minutes.

Conditions: The symptom is observed during normal operation, while IGMP snooping is enabled on switches connected to the routers.

Workaround: Disable IGMP snooping on the switches.

* CSCue06116

Symptom: VG350 gateway crashes when the configuration file is downloaded from CUCM. This occurs when the VG350 has 144 ports configured.

Conditions: The VG350 supports a maximum of 144 FXS ports. Configure MGCP control and download configuration from CUCM, gateway crashes.

Workaround: Use no ccm-manager config to stop the configuration download from CUCM.

* CSCue18133

Symptom: The Cisco 7600 router crashes at show\_li\_users.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under the following conditions: In li-view, create an username: lawful-intercept and li\_user password: lab1. Then, attempt its delete by "no username li\_user". Later, show users of LI.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue18806

Symptom: If an xTR enabled for LISP mobility is a “home xTR” (that is, it has the mobility subnet as a directly connected route) then traffic arriving non-LISP encapsulated for a host who has moved away, will not trigger a map-request. This means that this xTR does not have a pre-existing map-cache entry for the host who moved away, and traffic will be dropped.

Conditions: The symptom is observed if an xTR enabled for LISP mobility is a “home xTR”.

Workaround:

 1. On the xTR use the lig tool to cause a map-cache entry to be created.

 2. Configure the xTR as a PITR instead of an ITR.

* CSCue25575

Symptom: The crash is observed for SDP pass through or call forward or antitrombone cases.

Conditions: The crash is observed for a basic call involving SDP pass through or call forward or antitrombone cases.

Workaround: There no workaround.

* CSCue26213

Symptom: The connected interface that is enabled for EIGRP will not be redistributed into BGP.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the prefix of the connected interface is in the EIGRP topology table with “redistribute eigrp” under BGP address-family IPv4.

Workaround: Redistribute the connected interface and EIGRP.

* CSCue28318

Symptom: A Cisco router doing authentication proxy may unexpectedly reload when running the test aaa command command.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the router is using LDAP authentication and has a misconfigured LDAP authentication configuration.

Workaround: Correct the misconfiguration.

* CSCue35533

Symptom: Ping fails with security applied and IKE disabled.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the Cisco IOS Release 15.3(1.15)T image is loaded.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue36197

Symptom: The Cisco 7600 router may crash while performing the NSF IETF helper function for a neighbor over a sham-link undergoing NSF restart.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a router is configured as an MPLS VPN PE router with OSPF as PE-CE protocol. OSPF in VRF is configured with a sham-link and a neighbor router over a sham-link is capable of performing an NSF IETF restart on sham-links.

Note: This problem cannot be seen if both routers on sham-link ends are Cisco IOS routers.

Workaround: Disable the IETF Helper Mode protocol by entering the following commands:

enable

 configure terminal

 router ospf process-id [vrf vpn-name]

 nsf ietf helper disable

 end

Note: Disabling Helper Mode will result in an OSPF peer dropping adjacency if the peer is reloaded.

* CSCue41031

Symptom: Extra IPsec flow is shown in the “show crypto session” output.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the Cisco ASR 1000 RP1 FlexVPN Client.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue46236

Symptom: Router crash at ipigrp2\_redistribute\_process.

Conditions: The crash is observed when EIGRP is configured/unconfigured with redistribution from BGP continuously. Redistribution is being configured with route maps having both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes. In a scenario with routes flapping, RIB has deleted the route while EIGRP has not yet finished processing.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue46590

Symptom: HTTP POST messages may not be fixed properly after adding scansafe headers.

Conditions: This symptom was first identified on a Cisco ISR running a Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M2 image. A Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M1 image does not show the problem.

Workaround: Whitelist the domain from being sent over to the towers.

* CSCue46685

Symptom: Client MAC/framed IP missing in the coa:session query response from ISG.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you do a COA account-query for lite-session.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue47586

Symptom: For an MGRE tunnel, internal VLANs are not allocated in the standby supervisor.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when an HA router boots up with MGRE tunnel configurations. Internal VLANs are not allocated in the standby supervisor due to a sync issue during bootup.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue59189

Symptom: Cisco ME-3600X-24FS-M switch drops R-APS PDU packets and the following error messages are seen in the debug:

ERR: Packet with wrong version 0 or opcode 40 Failed to decode packet, Invalid argument

Conditions: The symptom is observed when used with devices that support only G.8032 (2008) for ERPS.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue61691

Symptom: In a dual-homing topology, switching from the backup mode to the nominal mode ends up with the active “source” router sending a data MDT but transmitting on the default MDT.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on a dual-homing topology with CORE GRE tunnel.

Workaround: Use the following command:

clear ip mroute vrf <>

* CSCue69535

Symptom: The Dynamic Performance Monitor fails to report the metrics.

Conditions: This symptom is observed after recreating the interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue73282

Symptom: VRF service applied on the L2 initiated DHCP session over EoGRE tunnel is not working.

Conditions: DHCP offer packets from the VRF pool are getting dropped under the above mentioned case.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue74543

Symptom: Adding an event listener returns an error.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you do a no service set pathtrace and service set pathtrace.

Workaround: Do no onep and onep again.

* CSCue76102

Symptom: Redistributed internal IPv6 routes from v6 IGP into BGP are not learned by the BGP neighboring routers.

Conditions: This symptom occurs because of a software issue, due to which the internal IPv6 redistributed routes from IGPs into BGP are not advertised correctly to the neighboring routers, resulting in the neighbors dropping these IPv6 BGP updates in inbound update processing. The result is that the peering routers do not have any such IPv6 routes in BGP tables from their neighbors.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue76251

Symptom: A BFD session is created for tunnel-tp without any BFD configuration underneath it.

Conditions: This symptom occurs only on bootup and when there is no BFD configuration underneath tunnel-tp.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue77265

Symptom: Increment memory leaks are seen at IPSec background proc.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when “clear cry session” is issued multiple times when bringing up the tunnel.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue81327

Symptom: Standby RP crashes during bulk sync with:

Unexpected exception to CPU: vector 1400

Conditions: The crash occurs while syncing a shutdown TE tunnel interface configuration.

Workaround: Delete the shutdown TE tunnel configuration, if not required.

* CSCue84146

Symptom: A Cisco 10000 series router crashes.

Conditions: Seen while running the below script which churns the mixed sessions (DHCP SIP/PMIP/GTP).

 1. Using landslide with performance accelerator enabled to emulate EoGRE client and GGSN:

Single test session with 37 test cases, 1 for GGSN and 36 for EoGRE tunnels

 6 EoGRE v4 tunnels for GTP with TAL, each tunnel with 1,500 sessions for a total of 9,000 sessions

 6 EoGRE v6 tunnels for GTP with TAL, each tunnel with 1,500 sessions for a total of 9,000 sessions

 6 EoGRE v4 tunnels for PMIPv6 with TAL, each tunnel with 1,500 sessions for a total of 9,000 sessions

 6 EoGRE v6 tunnels for PMIPv6 with TAL, each tunnel with 1,500 sessions for a total of 9,000 sessions

 6 EoGRE v4 tunnels for SIP with TAL, each tunnel with 1,000 sessions for a total of 6,000 sessions

 6 EoGRE v6 tunnels for SIP with TAL, each tunnel with 1,000 sessions for a total of 6,000 sessions

 Session initiation rate is 1 subscriber per second for each tunnel.

 With 36 tunnels, the aggregate initiation rate is 36 subs/sec.

 Bring up session via DHCP initiator/TAL.

 2. Per tunnel, after all sessions established, bi-directional traffic at 10pps per direction is applied per session.

 3. Each session has absolute timeout of 45 minutes.

 4. DHCP lease time is 45 minutes.

 5. After all 48,000 sessions are established, landslide is stopped.

 6. Wait till all sessions go down due to session absolute timeout.

 7. Wait till all DHCP bindings are released.

 8. Repeat steps 1-7.

Workaround: Without scaling the crash is not seen.

* CSCue85737

Symptom: ASR with PKI certificate may crash when issuing show crypto pki certificate command.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the show crypto pki certificate command is issued on ASR with PKI certificate.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue86147

Symptom: E-OAM state is going down when LACP is going down.

Conditions:

7600--------- ALU 72

There are LACP and E-OAM running on both the routers.

The behavior we observe is that the Cisco 7600 puts a member link into OPER DOWN state if LACP is not received on the port (on active mode). This OPER DOWN link state is propagated to all protocols including E-OAM.

This is incorrect as E-OAM runs below LACP and hence E-OAM must be able to receive/transmit and has a protocol state of UP irrespective of LACP indication if its state machine indicates so.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue87607

Symptom: LISP IOS xTR configured with {ip|ipv6} etr map-server server-address key key hash-function sha2 generates a SHA256 authentication incorrectly truncated to 160 bits causing registrations on a non-IOS map-server to fail.

When a registering xTR uses SHA2 authentication, the LISP IOS map-server expects a truncated authentication and will reject a correctly formatted SHA256 authentication.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on a router configured with LISP SHA2 map-server registration authentication.

Workaround: Configure SHA1 authentication instead of SHA2 on the xTR.

* CSCue93355

Symptom: GM fails to register with keyserver.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when SGT tagging is enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCue94610

Symptom: DSP crash with the following console error:

%SPA\_DSPRM-3-DSPALARMINFO: Checksum Failure:80000000,0000000e,d0156a80,d0156000 \*Mar 14 17:56:05.851: %SPA\_DSPRM-3-DSPALARM: Received alarm indication from dsp (1/3/6). %SPA\_DSPRM-3-DSPALARMINFO: 0042 0000 0080 0000 0000 0000 4368 6563 6B73 756D 2046 6169 6C75 7265 3A38 3030 3030 3030 302C 3030 3030 3030 3065 2C64 3031 3536 6138 302C 6430 3135 3630 3030 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000

Conditions: Error occurs during an RP switchover process. The standby RP presents DSPs failing to come up.

Workaround: This command may clear up the DSPs:

Router# hw-module subslot x/y reload...

* CSCue94653

Symptom: When the port-security configured interface goes to blocking state (MST), the VLANs configured on the port go to not-forwarding state temporarily. The secure mac-addresses are not added back resulting in loss of traffic.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the port-security configured interface goes to blocking state.

Workaround: Shut and no shut the port-security interface to re-add the mac-addresses.

* CSCue97986

Symptom: Calls hang at SIP, CCAPI and VOIP RTP components (but are cleared in the dataplane of the Cisco ASR 1000 series platform).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a video call is setup as an audio call. The call then gets transferred with REFER but the caller hangs up the call before the call gets transferred. This is an intermittent problem.

Workaround: If there is an SIP call dangling (sh sip call sum), then use the clear cal voice causecode 16 command to clear the dangling call.

* CSCuf01088

Symptom: Memory leaks are observed with a Cisco ASR router with CVP call flows.

Conditions: The symptom is observed under load conditions. Memory leaks are seen in Cisco IOS XE 3.8.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf04674

Symptom: Standby continuously crashes with traceback on pm\_vlan\_deallocate.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the router has both active and standby. When the router is coming up, the standby is crashing continuously though the active comes up without any issues. The router has an MDT configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf09006

Symptom: Upon doing a clear ip bgp \* soft out or graceful shutdown on a PE, all VPNv4/v6 routes on an RR from this PE are purged at the expiry of enhanced refresh stale-path timer.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. PE must have BGP peering with at least one CE (VRF neighbor) and at least one RR (VPN neighbor).

 2. PE must have a rtfilter unicast BGP peering with the RR.

 3. IOS version must have “Enhanced Refresh” feature enabled.

 4. A clear ip bgp \* soft out or graceful shutdown is executed on the PE.

Workaround: Instead of doing clear ip bgp \* soft out, do a route refresh individually towards all neighbors.

* CSCuf09032

Symptom: DHCP SIP database not cleared completely after session churning. Some sessions would end up in state “Waiting for cleanup” or “Down”.

Conditions: This can happen when there is a IP session and a renew comes to restart the DHCP session. Another case is DHCP renew comes but the LMA/GTP responded with a different IP. In that case, the ISG will NACK the client. If the client does not come back with a new discover the DHCP SIP session can be seen in down state.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf15260

Symptom: A Cisco ASR router crashes while sending notify with KPML digit.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on a Cisco ASR router. It is seen when the DTMF type is changing to SIP-KPML midcall.

Workaround: Do not change DTMF type mid-call.

* CSCuf17597

Symptom: No per-session features are applied on session if ISG first-sign-of-life is triggered by accounting-start from AZR.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when an accounting-start from AZR triggers MAC-TAL attempt on an ISG which fails to leave the session in unauthenticated-state. When subscriber logs into their sessions via the webauth-portal the ISG activates the features on the applied ISG-service but those applied to the ISG-session (e.g.: idle-timeout, accounting-method, etc.) are not applied. With no idle timer applied, sessions remain in stale-state indefinitely after subscriber had moved away from WiFi hotspot range without logging out their session.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf20537

Symptom: The router crashes due to null pointer dereference.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with the C4 VSS system (2 sup vss) with dual- homed fex stack (This has not been seen on other platforms, but the fix is ported as a precautionary measure). During the first SSO, no crash is observed [Active and Standby (Hot-Standby)]. During the second SSO, a is crash observed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf21611

Symptom: TDM voice call gets terminated due to voice-port shutdown when T1/E1 module on other NIM slot is reloaded (OIR).

Conditions: The symptom is observed when an OIR of T1/E1 module in any NIM slot shuts down the voice-ports (if any) on all other T1/E1 NIM slots.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf24592

Symptom:

 1. Certain counter values will appear to wrap around for condition 1 under the section “Aggregate traffic distribution statistics”.

 2. Certain counter values will appear to decrement instead of incrementing for condition 2 under the section "Aggregate traffic distribution statistics".

The following fields are affected:

Packet and byte counts

----------------------

Redirected Bytes

Redirected Packets

Received Bytes

Received Packets

Occurrences

-----------

Initial Redirects

Initial Redirects Accepted

Initial Redirect -> Passthrough

Redirect -> Passthrough

Conditions: The symptom is observed:

 1. When counter values exceed 4294967296.

 2. One of the following clear commands are run and value exceeds 4294967292:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) clear service-insertion statistics

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) clear service-insertion statistics service-node

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) clear service-insertion statistics service-node-group

The symptom will occur when viewing the output from either of the two show commands: show service-insertion statistics service-node or show service-insertion statistics service-node-group.

Workaround: Avoid issuing clear service-insertion statistics service-node-group and clear service-insertion statistics service-node. The stats for the counter values can be monitored up to 2^32 and wraparound thereafter. This limits the counter values to 2^32 instead of 2^64.

* CSCuf28017

Symptom: Sometimes some of the sessions will get stuck in authenticating/attempting state.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the session is being restarted. At that point of time, the SSS will send a message to the policy to get the authorization details if we get a terminate/release from the DHCP. The session will start the terminate process. Since the session does not have an SSS handle it will not send a disconnect to SSS.

Workaround: Manually clear session using clear subscriber session. If there is an associated binding, then also clear it using clear ip dhcp binding.

* CSCuf30554

Symptom: Traffic drops with scalable EoMPLS.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the MPLS label allocates 21 bit for the label with TE tunnel in the core.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf31322

Symptom: Mobility (PMIPv6/GTP) sessions fail to come up, get stuck at unauthen/service attempting state.

Conditions: The symptom is observed during session churning. Some mobility (PMIPv6/GTP) sessions fail to come up, but get stuck at unauthen/service attempting state.

Workaround: Manually clear the sessions.

* CSCuf49959

Symptom: Router crashes when you flap the tunnel interface.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when sessions are there, and you do a shut/no shut multiple times.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf51801

Symptom: CLI command show crypto session xxx results in memory leaks.

Conditions: Execution of show crypto CLI command appears to cause 168-byte memory leak for each of the following commands:

show crypto session brief

show crypto session local <IP> brief

show crypto session local <Mac> brief

show crypto session remote <Mac> brief

show crypto session remote <Mac> brief

show crypto session username <any> brief

show crypto tech-support peer <IP>

show crypto tech-support

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf64313

Symptom: Linecard crash is seen with machine-check exception.

Conditions: There is no trigger. The crash is random.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf65255

Symptom: A CPU hog is caused by unnecessary requests to calculate the dynamic MPLS label range for each of the service instances configured (especially for L3VPN services).

Conditions: This symptom will occur if there is any MPLS ip-propagate-ttl, label range, or per-interface MPLS MTU configuration on the switch/router. When this configuration is present, and there are a large number of interfaces, any operation that involves generating the configuration will be slow (for example, show run, copy run, write mem, etc).

This can result in the copy operation taking more than 300 seconds (for an average configuration size of 1000kB). Note that it will complete in due course, and the generated configuration will be correct (it takes longer than it should).

Workaround: Reducing the number of BGP routes injected for L3VPN sessions causes the CPU hog to last for a smaller duration as it reduces the number of MPLS labels assigned and thus the amount of unnecessary work being done.

* CSCuf65371

Symptom: On LAC, with “l2tp hidden” configured under VPDN template, L2TP sessions are failing to establish on existing L2TP tunnels after RP failover.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with “l2tp hidden” configured under VPDN template.

Workaround: Tear down L2TP tunnels after RP failover, or unconfigure “l2tp hidden”. Disabling L2TP redundancy with “no l2tp sso enable” will fix issue as well.

* CSCuf65404

Symptom: Call is failing if transcoder is needed for DTMF interworking and offer-all is configured.

Conditions: CUBE will reserve transcoder for codec mismatch and release the transcoder since codec are same, but DTMF still requires transcoder for interworking.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuf65724

Symptom: LISP control packets dropped in the network.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when there are more than 32 hops between sender and receiver.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

More Info: LISP control packets are sent with an IP TTL of 32, meaning if there is more than 32 IP hops between the sender and receiver, they will be dropped in the network.

* CSCuf82550

Symptom: Router displays malloc failure error message.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the router is running IPsec.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you configure the BC MAM model.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug28904

Symptom: Router drops ESP packets with CRYPTO-4-RECVD\_PKT\_MAC\_ERR.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the peer router sends nonce with length 256 bytes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCug44667

Symptom: SG3 fax call fails in STCAPP set up.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you disable fax and modem with no fax-relay sg3-to-g3 to use audio pass-through for voice port controlled by STCAPP. The CM tone detection is turn on and affected the fax.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

### Open Bugs—Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2)S

This section describes possibly unexpected behavior by Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2)S. All the bugs listed in this section are open in Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2)S. This section describes only severity 1, severity 2, and select severity 3 bugs.

* CSCub56842

Symptoms: The router stops passing IPsec traffic after some time.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the show crypto eli command output shows that during every IPsec P2 rekey, the active IPsec-Session count increases, which does not correlate to the max IPsec counters displayed in SW.

Workaround: Reload the router before active sessions reach the max value.

To verify, do as follows:

router#sh cry eli

 CryptoEngine Onboard VPN details: state = Active

 Capability : IPPCP, DES, 3DES, AES, GCM, GMAC, IPv6, GDOI, FAILCLOSE, HA

 IPSec-Session : 7855 active, 8000 max, 0 failed <<<

* CSCue74543

Symptoms: Add event listener returns error

Conditions: Do no service set pathtrace and service set pathtrace.

Workaround: Do no onep and onep again.

* CSCue80245

Symptoms: Router crashes while bootup from sup-bootdisk.

Conditions: Issue seen in two routers and formatting the bootdisk.

Workaround: There is no workaround

* CSCue93355

Symptoms: GM failed to register with KS.

Conditions: SGT tagging enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

### Resolved Bugs—Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2)S

All the bugs listed in this section are resolved in Cisco IOS Release 15.3(2)S. This section describes only severity 1, severity 2, and select severity 3 bugs.

* CSCej00344

Symptoms: A router may reload unexpectedly when opening a terminal session.

Conditions: This can be seen on any platform. It can be seen when starting any terminal session from the router, including a mistyped command which the router by default will try to resolve as an address to telnet to.

This bugs is not specific to X.25 config and is seen when initiating an outbound telnet/ssh/rlogin session from the device. Occurs when there are multiple outbound sessions from the same terminal (console,vty).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCsm40779

Symptoms: A router may go into initial configuration dialog on bootup.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a router that is running Cisco IOS Release 12.4(11)T2 with the c7200p-adventerprisek9-mz image.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCsr06399

Symptoms: A Cisco 5400XM may reload unexpectedly.

Conditions: This symptom is intermittent and is seen only when the DSPs available are insufficient to support the number of calls.

Workaround: Ensure that sufficient DSPs are available for transcoding.

* CSCsr10335

Symptoms: A router loses its default gateway during autoinstall.

Conditions: This issue was seen on Cisco IOS Release 12.4(15)T5, but should affect every Cisco IOS version.

Workaround:

 1. Manually do a shut followed by a no shut on the interface.

 2. Create an EEM script, for example:

event manager applet Check-Default-Route event syslog pattern

"CNS-3-TRANSPORT: CNS\_HTTP\_CONNECTION\_FAILED"

 action 1.0 cli command <CmdBold>enable<noCmdBold>

 action 1.1 cli command <CmdBold>config term<noCmdBold>

 action 1.2 cli command <CmdBold>interface GigabitEthernet0/0<noCmdBold>

 action 1.3 cli command <CmdBold>shut<noCmdBold>

 action 1.4 cli command <CmdBold>no shut<noCmdBold>

 action 1.5 cli command <CmdBold>end<noCmdBold>

 action 1.6 cli command <CmdBold>write<noCmdBold>

!

end

 3. In network-config, configure “ip address dhcp” for the interface which is supposed to get the default gateway from DHCP.

interface interface\_name

ip address dhcp end

* CSCsx57360

Symptoms: A Cisco 870 router may fail to write a crashinfo file and will display the following error on the console:

File flash:crashinfo\_XXXXXXXX-XXXXXX open failed (-1): Not enough space

Conditions: The symptom is observed with certain types of memory corruption.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtc42734

Symptoms: A communication failure may occur due to a stale next-hop.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the static route for an IPv6 prefix assigned by DHCP has a stale next-hop for terminated users.

Workaround: Reload the router.

* CSCtg82170

Symptoms: The IP SLA destination IP/port configuration changes over a random period of time. This issue is hard to reproduce but has been reported after upgrading to Cisco IOS Release 15.1(1).

So far, it only seems to have affected the destination IP and port. The destination IP may be changed to an existing destination IP that has already been used by another probe. The destination port is sometimes changed to 1967 which is reserved for IP SLA control packets. Other random destination ports have also been observed to replace the configured port for some of the IP SLA probes.Each time when the change happens, many of the IP SLA probes will stop running.

Conditions: This symptom is observed in Cisco IOS Release 15.1(1)XB and Cisco IOS Release 15.1(1)T. Other Cisco IOS versions may also be affected.

Workaround: A possible workaround is to downgrade to any Cisco IOS versions older than Cisco IOS Release 15.1.x.

* CSCth03648

Symptoms: Cisco 2960 and 3750 series switches running Cisco IOS Release 12.2 (53)SE1 may crash.

Workaround: Disable all snmp traps.

* CSCth71093

Symptoms: Routers configured to dump core to flash: or flash0: fail to dump correctly to 4GB CompactFlash card.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with the following configuration:

(Cisco 3925) exception flash all flash0:

(Cisco 3825) exception flash all flash:

Then when you issue a wr core, it fails to dump core files.

Workaround: Dump cores to TFTP.

* CSCti62247

Symptoms: If an IPv4 or IPv6 packet is sent to a null interface, a Cisco ASR 1000 series router will not respond with an ICMP or ICMPv6 packet.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with a prefix routed to Null0 interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtj89743

Symptoms: The Cisco Catalyst 4000 series switches running Cisco IOS Release 12.2(54)SG experiences high CPU when issuing an unsupported command, https://ip-address, in which ip-address is accessible from this device.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the Cisco Catalyst 4000 series switches.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Further Problem Description: Even if SSL handshake fails, the HTTP CORE process is looping and is scheduled repeatedly.

* CSCtk00181

Symptoms: Password aging with crypto configuration fails.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when Windows AD is set with “Password expires on next log on” and the VPN client is initiating a call to NAS. NAS does not prompt for a new password and instead gives an Auth failure.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtk15666

Symptoms: IOS password length is limited to 25 characters.

Conditions: IOS password length is limited to 25 characters on NG3K products.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtq41512

Symptoms: After reload, ISDN layer 1 shows as deactivated. Shut/no shut brings the PRI layer 1 to Active and layer 2 to Multi-frame established.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when “voice-class busyout” is configured and the controller TEI comes up before the monitored interface.

Workaround: Remove the “voice-class busyout” configuration from the voice-port.

* CSCtq91063

Symptoms: A Cisco router may unexpectedly reload due to bus error or generate a spurious access.

Conditions: The issue occurs when fragmentation of a tunneled packet fails due to the F/S particle pool running out of free particles. The F/S pool is used for fragmentation, so this exhaustion of this pool will occur when there is a large amount of traffic flowing for which fragmentation is required. By default, path MTU discovery is enabled for tunnels which means that fragmentation is done at the tunnel interface, rather than the underlying interface and this issue is not hit. If the MTU is overridden then it may become exposed to this issue. Assuming the tunnel is over an ethernet interface with MTU of 1500, then this will happen by setting the tunnel MTU to greater than 1476 bytes.

Workarounds:

 1. Remove MTU override from the tunnel interface; or

 2. Configure “service disable-ip-fast-frag”; or

 3. Reduce hold queue sizes such that the total size of the queues for all active interfaces in the system does not exceed 512.

* CSCts89761

Symptoms:

 1. Inline service policy Configuration: Unable to configure monitor parameters once the flow monitor is specified. See the following example:

Router(config)#interface GigabitEthernet0/2/1

Router(config-if)#service-policy type performance-monitor inline input

Router(config-if-spolicy-inline)#match access-group 110

Router(config-if-spolicy-inline)#flow monitor FM\_DEF\_TCP <--- After this point, all configs will print out an error message

Router(config-if-spolicy-inline)#monitor parameters <----- Not accepted

Router(config-spolicy-inline-mparam)#interval duration 10 <-------- Not accepted

Router(config-spolicy-inline-mparam)#history 5 <------------ Not accepted

 2. Non-inline service policy: Unable to change monitor parameters once the flow monitor is bound to a policy-map and attached to an interface. See the following example:

If an attempt is made to change monitor parameters of an already attached policy as below, it will be rejected.

UUT\_451(config)#policy-map type performance-monitor VM\_POLICY

UUT\_451(config-pmap)#class VM\_CLASS

UUT\_451(config-pmap-c)#flow monitor VM\_MONITOR

UUT\_451(config-pmap-c)#monitor parameters

UUT\_451(config-pmap-c-mparam)#interval duration 7 <----- Error message will show up if previous interval duration is different

UUT\_451(config-pmap-c-mparam)#react 102 mrv <-------- Error message will show up if this react was not configured before or if the subsequent command changes the threshold value of the already-configured react.

Conditions:

 1. This symptom is seen when configuring an inline service policy for performance monitor on ASR platform.

 2. This symptom is seen when modifying monitor parameters of a non-inline service policy for performance monitor on a Cisco ASR platform.

Workaround:

1. To configure inline service policy, always specify all monitor parameters first and put the flow monitor monitor name command as the last command in the configuration.

2. To change monitor parameters, remove the service-policy by using the no service-policy command, make your changes, and then reattach the service-policy.

The above configuration restrictions do not apply if the enclosing policy-map is not attached to any interface. Also the changes do not apply if you specify an “empty” flow monitor, for example a flow monitor without an enclosing valid flow record.

InterOp:Cube-NavTel : LTI: Video Xcode Call with plain Audio FAILS

Conditions: This symptom is seen when video Xcode call with plain audio fails.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty37233

Symptoms: A layer-3 (routed) interface can be converted to layer-2 (switched) interface by applying the switchport configuration command. If the interface was configured as a vnet trunk the vnet subinterfaces are deleted. Subsequently, if the switchport command is removed the “vnet trunk” configuration will reappear but the vnet trunk will no longer be functional. When a switchover is performed following the sequence above the new active takes over as expected, but when the old active reboots as standby, configuration sync fails because the standby attempts to create the vnet subinterfaces which no longer exist on the active. This results in a ifindex-sync failure and a PRC error that causes the RP to go into a continuous reboot loop.

Conditions: The symptom only occurs on switch platforms with a redundant RP.

Workaround: Remove the “vnet trunk” configuration from an interface before converting it from layer-3 to layer-2.

* CSCty44654

Symptoms: The router crashes when trying to test the MVPN6 functionality.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Configure the router to test the MVPN6 functionality.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Delete the VRF associated with the interface in the MVPN6 test configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty51088

Symptoms: On a Cisco ME 3600X or Cisco ME 3800X, when traffic for a group (S2,G) is sent to an interface that is already acting as the source for another group (S1,G), it does not receive any traffic since no (S2,G) entry is formed.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the receiver interface is already a source interface for another multicast stream.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCty57476

Symptoms: The BGP GSHUT feature needs to add support for the AA:NN format for community.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when support is added for the AA:NN format for community when using the BGP GSHUT feature.

* CSCtz60398

Symptoms: Continuous “platform assert failure” tracebacks with CFM over Xconnect on the router.

Conditions: CFMoXconnect with mpls TE in core. Flap the core facing link.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz69969

Symptoms: Changing the speed of one of the member interfaces of a port-channel causes a traceback on the Cisco ASR 901 and the node reloads.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you execute the “speed” CLI to change the speed of one of the member interfaces belonging to a port-channel.

Workaround: In order to change the speed of one of the port-channel members, remove that member interface from the port-channel, change the speed, and add it back to the port-channel.

* CSCtz74540

Symptoms: In a VSS system, the old Active Supervisor hangs after a mistral error interrupt occurs on the SP.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on a VSS system, after a mistral hardware error (such as a parity error) occurs on the SP of the router. There is no issue if the error occurs on the RP.

Workaround: There is no workaround. The switch with the old Active Supervisor must be power cycled.

* CSCtz74604

* CSCtz88879

Symptoms: When testing for DMVPN in a HUB-SPOKE topology, where there are 170 tunnels protected with IPsec on Spoke and one mGRE tunnel on hub. B2B redundancy is configured. No QoS is applied on the scaled IPSec tunnels. Upon doing SSO with this configuration, the a “%VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnelx: allocated idb has invalid vlan id” error message is seen repeatedly on the new active and the router becomes almost inaccessible. As can be seen from show vlan int usage command output, there are more than 3K free VLANs on both the Hub and Spoke.

\*May 14 12:31:10.315: %VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnel87: allocated idb

has invalid vlan id

\*May 14 12:31:10.511: %VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnel26: allocated idb

\*May 14 12:31:10.543: %VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnel28: allocated idb

has invalid vlan id

\*May 14 12:31:10.575: %VPNSMIOS-3-MACEDONTUNNELVLANERR: Tunnel90: allocated idb

has invalid vlan id

After a continuous flood of error messages, a Granikos crash is seen, and the show cry eli command shows only one SPA and this SPA is stuck in INIT state.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when doing a shut/no shut using the interface range command, and once all tunnels are up, doing an SSO.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCtz92606

Symptoms: MFR memberlinks-T1 serial interfaces created under a CHOC12 controller, do not get decoupled from MFR even after the MFR bundle interface is deleted. Once the MFR bundle interface is reconfigured, the memberlinks do not appear under it.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with MFR with memberlinks as T1 serials from CHOC12 sonet controller.

Workaround: Unconfigure and reconfigure the “encap frame-relay MFRx” under each memberlink after reconfiguring the MFR bundle interface.

* CSCua01641

Symptoms: The router’s NAS-IP address contained in the RADIUS accounting-on packet is 0.0.0.0:

Conditions: Occurs when you restart the router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua12396

Symptoms: IPv6 multicast routing is broken when we have master switchover scenarios with a large number of members in stack. Issue is seen on platforms like Cisco 3750E and Cisco 3750X where IPV6 multicast routing is supported.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when IPV6 multicast routing is configured, mcast routes are populated and traffic is being forwarded. Now, in case of master switchover, synchronization between master and members is disrupted. This is seen only for IPv6 multicast routing. Observed the issue with 9-member stack and either during first or second master switchover. No issues are seen for IPv4 multicast routing.

Workaround: Tested with 5-member stack, and no issues are seen. It is recommended to enable IPv6 multicast routing when there is deployment with low members in stack.

* CSCua13322

Symptoms: Routes for the converted dedicated P sessions are missing after a RP switchover.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when converted dedicated IP sessions are not HA aware. After a RP switchover, these sessions will be reestablished at the new active RP. Routes are not installed for some of these sessions. As a result, downstream traffic is dropped.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua13551

Symptoms: The Cisco Catalyst 6000 and Cisco ASR 1000 learning candidate default routes from the Cisco Nexus due to which the default route is not being learned properly and causes an outage.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the Cisco Nexus is running into a bug CSCtz79151 because of which it is advertising the candidate defaults to its downstream neighbors.

Workaround: Configure “default-information in xxxx” on the Cisco Catalyst 6500, where xxx is an ACL denying all default candidates from being learned, except 0.0.0.0/0.

On the Cisco Catalyst 6500:

* CSCua24676

Symptoms: The VRF to the global packet’s length is corrupted by -1.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the next-hop in the VRF is global and recursive going out labeled. This issue is seen from Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)S3a onwards, but is not seen in Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)S2.

Workaround: Use the next-hop interface IP instead of the recursive next-hop.

* CSCua26981

Symptoms: A Cisco ASR router may crash due to a CPU Watchdog upon invocation of “show ip eigrp neighbor detail”.

sh ip eigrp nei detail

<snip>

ASR1000-WATCHDOG: Process = Exec

%SCHED-0-WATCHDOG: Scheduler running for a long time, more than the maximum

configured (120) secs.

-Traceback=...

========= Start of Crashinfo Collection (09:21:44 EST Wed May 9 2012) ========== =

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the Cisco ASR router is experiencing rapid changes in EIGRP neighborship, such as during a flap. One way to artificially create this scenario is to mismatch the interface MTU.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua33788

Symptoms: The router does not pass multicast traffic consistently; only some traffic passes.

Conditions: Occurs when you configure 255 EVCs spanning across different slots on the router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua42104

Symptoms: Malformed RTCP packets are observed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when DTMF interworking is enabled or SRTP/SRTCP is in use.

Workaround: Disable DTMF interworking if not required for the call.

* CSCua43111

Symptoms: DFC cards in a Cisco Catalyst 6500 with a single Sup720 may remain up, continue forwarding traffic, and create L2 loops when the “test crash” command is used.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on a Catalyst 6500 with a single Sup720 and DFC cards when the “test crash” command introducing a parity error in the ARP process is executed.

Workaround: Do not use the “test crash” command.

* CSCua47056

Symptoms: The Cisco Catalyst 6000 crashes after the removal of the supervisor module from active VSS with the following traceback:

0x41048F64 ---> ospf\_rcv\_dbd+F48

0x41041FE8 ---> ospf\_router+548

0x4166C0B0 ---> r4k\_process\_dispatch+14

0x4166C09C ---> r4k\_process\_dispatch

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the following reproduction procedure is performed: NSF is disabled including helper using the below given commands:

router ospf <AS>

no nsf

nsf cisco helper disable

Adjacency flapped. NSF enabled again. Performed switchover.

Workaround: Avoid the reproduction procedure in the production. Neighbors should see the router configured for “nsf cisco” as OOB resync capable:

Router#sh ip ospf nei <interface> detail

...

 LLS Options is 0x1 (LR) <-- LR bit means OOB resync capability

...

If the router is configured for the “nsf cisco”, but the neighbor does not see LR bit set for router with “nsf cisco”, flap the adjacency, and OOB resync capability will be renegotiated.

* CSCua47495

Symptoms: The nine-member stack of the Cisco Catalyst 3750 gets into a low memory condition.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with a default configuration on bootup.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua49803

Symptoms: The ingress PE in an MVPNv6 setup crashes.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on performing SSO with MVPNv6 SM and SSM traffic for 50 VRFs.

Workaround: There is no known workaround.

* CSCua56209

Symptoms: PWs do not come up after SSO.

Conditions: This symptom is only a specific case, where the primary pseudowire path is DN when the active RP coming up, so the backup PW comes to UP state. Later, when the primary path is available, pseudowire redundancy switchover occurs and the primary PW becomes UP. At this stage, if the Software Switchover occurs, the PWs on the newly active RP is DN. This is a corner case and the chances of this issue occurring in the real deployment scenarios is very low.

Workaround: Issue the clear xconnect all command to bring the PWs UP.

* CSCua56802

Symptoms: QoS will not work on one of the subinterfaces/EVC.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when HQoS policy is configured on more than one subinterface/EVC on ES+ and then add flat SG on them.

Workaround: Remove and reapply SG.

* CSCua56999

Symptoms: Abnormal line card reload occurs.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when an MVPNv6 scaled router acts as PE on which source traffic is ingressing and the line card is connected on the access side.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua58100

Symptoms: The syslog is flooded with the following traceback message:

Jun 20 10:05:23.961 edt: %SYS-2-NOTQ: unqueue didn't find 7F3D26BDCCD8 in queue

7F3CA5E4A240 -Process= "RADIUS Proxy", ipl= 0, pid= 223

Conditions: Occurs under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You establish 36k EAPSIM sessions using a RADIUS client on server A.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) You establish 36k roaming sessions using a RADIUS client on server B.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The roaming sessions have the same caller-station-id but use a different IP address than the EAPSIM sessions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua61330

Symptoms: Traffic loss is observed during switchover if,

 1. BGP graceful restart is enabled.

 2. The next-hop is learned by BGP.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on a Cisco router running Cisco IOS XE Release 3.5S.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua63182

Symptoms: Incorrect minimum bandwidth is displayed when 0k bandwidth is received from a peer of a different version.

Conditions: This symptom occurs under the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Different behavior in Cisco ASR code when the bandwidth for a route is very high, that is, more than 10G.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6.2 and earlier releases send 0K when the bandwidth for a route is more than 10G.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6.2 and earlier releases use incoming interface bandwidth, when BW = 0 is received.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4.3S and later releases send the real bandwidth, even if it is more than 10G.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4.3S and later releases use the lesser value between “received bandwidth” and “incoming interface bandwidth”.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4.3S and later releases convert incoming bandwidth to 1K in case BW = 0 received.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) When the peers are of the same or compatible version, that is, both peers are Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6.2 and earlier releases or both peers are Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4.3S and later releases, there is no issue. However, when the peers are of different or incompatible version, that is, one peer is Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6.2 or an earlier release and the other peer is Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4.3S or a later release, then this issue is seen.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua65155

Symptoms: Label replication VLANs are leaked even after deleting VRFs.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a plain MLDP feature configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua67998

Symptoms: System crashes.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after adding or removing a policy-map to a scaled GRE tunnel configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua68243

Symptoms: IGMP and PIM control packets are not reaching RP. As a result, the mac-address table for IGMP snooping entries is not populated.

Conditions: This can be seen on a Cisco 7600 series router that is running IOS where IGMP and PIM control packets come in on an SVI only after the condition where the SVI link state goes down and comes up again. This does not affect routed ports.

Workaround: In the SVI configuration mode:

 1. Unconfigure PIM by using no ip pim.

 2. Unconfigure IGMP snooping by using no ip igmp snooping.

 3. Re-enable both PIM and IGMP snooping.

* CSCua70065

Symptoms: CUBE reloads on testing DO-EO secure video call over CUBE when SDP passthru is enabled.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when running Cisco IOS interim Release 15.3(0.4)T.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua75069

Symptoms: BGP sometimes fails to send an update or a withdraw to an iBGP peer (missing update)

Conditions: This symptom is observed only when all of the following conditions are met:

 1. BGP advertise-best-external is configured, or diverse-path is configured for at least one neighbor.

 2. The router has one more BGP peers.

 3. The router receives an update from a peer, which changes an attribute on the backup path/repair path in a way which does not cause that path to become the best path.

 4. The best path for the net in step #3 does not get updated.

 5. At least one of the following occurs:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) A subsequent configuration change would cause the net to be advertised or withdrawn.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Dampening would cause the net to be withdrawn.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) SOO policy would cause the net to be withdrawn.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Split Horizon or Loop Detection would cause the net to be withdrawn.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) IPv4 AF-based filtering would cause the net to be withdrawn.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) ORF-based filtering would cause the net to be withdrawn.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The net would be withdrawn because it is no longer in the RIB.

The following Cisco IOS releases are known to be impacted if they do not include this fix:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS Release 15.2T and later releases

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS Release 15.1S and later releases

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS Release 15.2M and later releases

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Cisco IOS Release 15.0EX and later releases

Older releases on these trains are not impacted.

Workaround: If this issue is triggered by a configuration change, you can subsequently issue the clear ip bgp neighbor soft out command.

* CSCua75566

Symptoms: Scalable EoMPLS traffic drop is observed at the disposition side after performing provision/unprovision of xconnect VCs.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when scalable EoMPLS is configured between PE routers and AC is the interface of ES+ model 76-ES+T+XC-40G, with ES+ HD as the core-facing interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua75781

Symptoms: CME reloads for E911 call ELIN translation for incoming FXS/FXO trunk.

Conditions: The symptom is observed from Cisco IOS interim Release 15.3(0.2)T.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua76157

Symptoms: BGP routes are displayed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after removing the “send-label” from PE.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua78782

Symptoms: Authentication of EzVPN fails.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with BR-->ISP-->HQ.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua82440

Symptoms: FNF records do not get exported when a user reloads the router.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if a user configures a non-default export-protocol, i.e., anything other than “netflow-v9”. If the user configures a non-default export-protocol such as IPFIX or netflow-v5, after saving the configuration to the start-up configuration and reloading the router, the exporter will not export any records.

Workaround: Either one of the following methods will fix this issue:

 1. Remove and reconfigure the exporter configuration after reload.

 2. Change the export-protocol to the default value (netflow-v9).

* CSCua82947

Symptoms: Encapsulation for CFM messages may not be correct after the service instance encapsulation is changed. IOS-FMAN-EAOM-ERR message may be observed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on an Ethernet CFM configured on a bridge-domain or xconnect service instance.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua84923

Symptoms: Following a misconfiguration on a two-level hierarchical policy with a user-defined queue-limit on a child policy, the UUT fails to attach the QoS policy on the interface even when corrected queuing features are used.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

 1. The issue must have the user-defined queue-limit defined.

 2. This error recovery defected is confirmed as a side effect with the c3pl cnh component project due to ppcp/cce infrastructure enhancement.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua85239

Symptoms: Flapping BGP sessions are seen if large BGP update messages are sent out and BGP packets are fragmented because midpoint routers have the smaller “mtu” or “ip mtu” configured.

to 2.2.2.5(17744) tableid - 0

Conditions: This symptom is observed between two BGP peers with matching MD5 passwords configured and can be triggered by the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) If the midpoint path has the “mtu” or “ip mtu” setting that is smaller than the outgoing interface on BGP routers, it will be force the BGP router to fragment the BGP packet while sending packets through the outgoing interface.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Peering down and the MD5 error do not always occur. They occur only once or twice within 10 tests.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua85604

Symptoms: Ingress Qos on EVC stops working after reload or after interface flap.

Conditions: This symptom occurs only on EVC QOS.

Workaround: Remove and reconfigure the QOS on EVC.

* CSCua90061

Symptoms: The WS-IPSEC-3 Module crashes post configuration change.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you dynamically modify the GRE tunnel protected with IPsec to the sVTI tunnel and vice versa while traffic is traversing across the IPsec tunnel.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua91473

Symptoms: Memory leak occurs during rekey on the IPsec key engine process.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after rekey, when the IPsec key engine does not release KMI memory, causing the IPsec key engine holding memory to keep increasing.

Workaround: Clear crypto session for IPsec key engine to release memory.

* CSCua93001

Symptoms: Auto-RP group is not automatically joined upon bootup.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when the router reboots and starts from the existing configurations.

Workaround: Manually re-enable “ip pim autorp” after bootup.

* CSCua94334

Symptoms: Hung calls are seen on CME. Hung calls seen in “show call active voice brief” are as follows:

1502 : 26 36329310ms.1 +-1 pid:1 Answer XXXYYY4835 connected

dur 00:00:00 tx:0/0 rx:0/0

pre-ietf TextRelay: off

media inactive detected:n media contrl rcvd:n/a timestamp:n/a

long duration call detected:n long duration call duration:n/a timestamp:n/a

Conditions: This symptom is observed when an inbound H225 call setup request to a CME gateway results in a hung call if a release complete is received while still in alerting state. This issue occurs only when the shared line is configured on the phone and the shared line is not registered.

Workaround: Remove the shared line or register the shared line.

* CSCua96354

Symptoms: Reload may occur when issuing the show oer and show pfr commands.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following commands:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) show oer master traffic-class performance

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) show pfr master traffic-class performance

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua97282

Symptoms: Router crashes.

Conditions: The  **no ip routing**   command  is issued when router isis is running and there are thousands of ip routes being processed by isis.

Workaround: Only issue ip routing after deconfiguring isis ip by issuing  **no ip router isis** before issuing  **no ip routing**.

* CSCua98421

Symptoms: RMEPs from a Cisco ASR 9000 are not learned on a Cisco ME 3800X with CFM running over an xconnect. The Cisco ASR 9000 does learn the RMEPs from the Cisco ME 3800X.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when QoS is enabled on the Cisco ME 3800X prior to enabling CFM.

Workaround: Apply the CFM configuration before QoS or reload the switch with both QoS and CFM enabled in the configuration.

* CSCua98805

Symptoms: Tracebacks are seen at adjmgr\_free\_met.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on defaulting an attachment interface having an L2PT configuration and used for VPLS.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCua98902

Symptoms: fibidb is not getting intialized.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when LFA FRR is configured in Cisco ME 3800x and ME 3600x switches.

* CSCua99969

Symptoms: IPv6 PIM null-register is not sent in the VRF context.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in the VRF context.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub01494

Symptoms: AD in the route installed by client is not updated to the configured value.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when the CLI “ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 dhcp 5” is configured. AD is not updated to 5.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub04112

Symptoms: The router may lose OSPF routes pointing to the reconfigured OSPF interface.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after quick removal and adding of the interface IP address by script or copy and paste.

For example, configure the following:

interface Ethernet0/0

 ip address 1.1.100.200 255.255.255.0

 ip ospf network point-to-point

 ip ospf 1 area 0

end

Then, quickly remove/add the IP address:

conf t

interface Ethernet0/0

 no ip address 1.1.100.200 255.255.255.0

 ip address 1.1.100.200 255.255.255.0

 ip ospf network point-to-point

 ip ospf 1 area 0

end

Workaround: Insert a short delay in between commands for removing/adding the IP address. The delay should be longer than the wait interval for LSA origination; by default, it is 500 ms. Or, refresh the routing table by “clear ip route \*”.

* CSCub04782

Symptoms: In a 1:1 (one active and one standby) scenario, when the hot standby converges to active, port-channel does not come down, but the REP reconverges. The fast-switchover occurs nearly in 1 second.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in a 1:1 (one active and one-standby) scenario, when the hot standby converges to active, port-channel does not come down, but the REP reconverges.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub04982

Symptoms: In an IPFRR configuration, a traceback is seen about changing the FRR primary OCE where the new OCE has a different interface and next-hop, which blocks such a linkage.

Conditions: This symptom occurs while changing the FRR primary OCE interface to a new OCE with a different interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub06131

Symptoms: The IPSLA sender box can reload with the following message:

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the IPSLA sender box.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub06859

Symptoms: OSPFv2 NSR on quad-sup VSS does not work. The router stops sending hello packets after switchover.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with quad-sup VSS with OSPFv2 NSR.

Workaround: Clear the IP OSPF process after NSR switchover.

* CSCub09099

Symptoms: When the BGP MDT address-family is configured with one or more VRFs having “mdt default x.x.x.x” with 4000 VRFs, of which 400 VRFs have “mdt default x.x.x.x” and with 8000 BGP neighbors in VRF (4K IPv4 & 4K IPv6), then the router takes close to 30 minutes to apply the configuration.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if neighbors are configured under BGP VRF address-family with the update-source command, that is, neighbor X.X.X.X update-source <interface>.

Workaround: Do not use neighbor X.X.X.X update-source <interface> under the BGP VRF address-family.

* CSCub10950

Symptoms: Router crash when MR-APS switch is made. Crash is coming randomly.

Conditions: Configured for MLP with 12 links.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub12911

Symptoms: If we do not define the profile in the AAA and send DHCP discover for MN to MAG/ISG. ASR crashes immediately.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the profile is not defined.

Workaround: Define the profile in ISG.

* CSCub14044

Symptoms: A crash with traceback is seen, and all calls are dropped.

Conditions: This symptom is observed under all conditions.

Workaround: There is no known workaround. The gateway crashes, and the soak time appears to be six weeks.

* CSCub14299

Symptoms: The router reloads when “no mediatrace initiator” is issued.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when traceroute is enabled for a mediatrace session.

Workaround: Disable traceroute under each configured mediatrace session.

* CSCub15105

Symptoms: Traffic drop of MVPNv6 data MDT packets is seen.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on doing a VRF delete and adding it on the encapsulated PE in a scaled MVPNv6 setup; the L3 DENY RESULT drop counters increment for the encapsulated VLAN v4. From a multicast point of view, the drop is at the point where the packet reaches the encapsulated VLAN v4 to proceed further with backbone forwarding.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub15402

Symptoms: A VRF cannot be deleted. The following error message is displayed:

error message "% Deletion of VRF VPNA in progress; wait for it to complete".

Conditions: This symptom occurs after having previously issued “sh ip cef vrf \* sum”.

Workaround: There is no workaround. Reboot is required to remove the VRF.

* CSCub17584

Symptoms: Cisco IOSD crashes seen with 1K MVPN sessions. (When the sessions are cleared, all the IGMP joins are released, and then the sessions are brought up. When there are about 400 to 500 IGMP joins, the crash is seen.)

* CSCub18997

Symptoms: A Cisco ME 3800 running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)S1 may crash under certain scenarios due to a stack overflow.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when QoS is configured.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub19185

Symptoms: Path confirmation fails for a SIP-SIP call with IPV6 enabled.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when UUTs are running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(2)T1.5.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub19921

Symptoms: Route flaps could occur after a switchover when a router is configure to use ISIS IETF NSF. The route timestamp is refreshed in the show ip route command output. Packet traffic going through the router could be dropped as a result of the switchover. This issue is seen only with a point-to-point interface or on a LAN configured as point-to-point.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you configure ISIS NSF IETF and the point-to-point interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub22049

Symptoms: Native MCAST traffic is not forwarded over a nile1 after core interface shut/no shut.

Conditions: This symptom is observed after doing shut/no shut or interface flap a couple of times.

Workaround: “clear ip mroute <mcast\_group>” or “clear ip route \*”.

Further Problem Description: Not all the multicast groups will be affected. The behavior is inconsistent.

* CSCub23231

Symptoms: Very specific events/packet types cause the ES20 LC to stop passing traffic. Information on these events and packets that lead to the issue are not known currently.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the ES20 interface has an EVC or MPLS configuration.

Workaround: Reload LC.

* CSCub23971

Symptoms: An Access-Request sent by a BRAS might miss ANCP-attributes.

Conditions: This symptom is observed if an ANCP-enabled subinterface is set up the first time or it gets removed/readded.

Workaround: Reconfigure the ANCP neighbor name.

* CSCub28997

Symptom: Overlord crashes with 2000 crypto sessions (4000 IPSec SA’s) upon repeatedly clearing and reestablishing the SA’s.

Condition: The box is configured with 1K VRFs and 1K Virtual templates. And the crypto sessions are repeatedly cleared/reestablished.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub31477

Symptoms: A Cisco ISG router configured for Layer 2 Connected Subscriber Sessions does not respond to ARP replies once a subscriber ARP cache has expired.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the router is configured as ISG L2-Connect, the router has configured HSRP as the high-availability method, and the subscriber-facing interface is configured with “no ip proxy arp”. This issue is not seen if either HSRP is removed or if “ip proxy arp” is enabled.

Workaround: Clear the subscriber session. After the subscriber is reintroduced, the issue is resolved. You can also configure “ip proxy arp” on the HSRP-configured interface.

* CSCub32500

Symptoms: The router crashes in EIGRP due to chunk corruption.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on EIGRP flaps.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub33470

Symptoms: Default profiles showing up as custom.

Conditions: The symptom is observed with a Cisco Catalyst 3000/Catalyst 4000 platform which supports the IP SLA video operation. Has no affect on the operation itself.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub34018

Symptoms: The Remote-ID option received on the server does not contain the VLAN ID of the subinterface configured on the relay in Cisco IOS XE Release 3.8S.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the connection between the client and relay is on a subinterface (VLAN).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub34534

Symptoms: A basic call between 2 SIP phones over SIP trunk (KPML-enabled) fails.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco ISR G2 platforms.

Workaround: There is no workaround

* CSCub34595

Symptoms: Enabling Dynamic ARP Resolution (DAI) on a VLAN may cause ARP resolution to fail for hosts in other VLANs.

Conditions: This symptom is seen when enabling DAI on a VLAN.

Workaround: Enable DAI for the failing VLAN with the ip arp inspection vlan x command.

E.g.:

ip arp inspection vlan 30

 int gi 0/10

 ip arp inspection trust

 int gi 0/11

 ip arp inspection trust

Workaround: Enable DAI for the failing VLAN with the ip arp inspection vlan x command. Configure an ARP ACL to permit traffic for valid IP source + MAC source pair with the arp access- list acl\_name command. Configure DAI filter and associate with the ARP ACL with the ip arp inspection filter acl\_name vlan x command. Configure DAI trust on egress port with ip arp inspection trust.

E.g.:

ip arp inspection vlan 20

 arp access-list testacl

 permit ip 10.1.1.3 255.255.255.0 mac 01:00:00:0E:0E:0F

 ip arp inspection filter testacl vlan 20

 int gig0/10

 ip arp inspection trust

* CSCub34756

Symptoms: RP crash is observed at rrr\_lm\_resource\_link\_ready after performing SSO on the midpoint router on protect LSP.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when an RP card hosting the TP tunnel midpoint is undergoing the SSO operation. During SSO recovery, the TP fails to recover the TP tunnel midpoint interface (virtual) that is causing it to send a NULL interface to TE for checking its readiness. TE is not checking the NULL pointer condition and accessing the link elements that are causing the crash.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub36217

Symptoms: When the ME3800 router is running IOS 15.2(04)S software, if EVC maximum MAC security address limit is reached for a service instance, new MAC address is not rejected.

Conditions: When EVC MAC security is enabled under a service instance.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 1.7/1.3:

* CSCub36356

Symptoms: Scaling up routes result in huge memory allocations, eventually depleting the SP memory, leading to MALLOC FAIL and subsequent system crash.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in normal conditions.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub36403

Symptoms: Standby reloads due to no switchport.

Conditions: Configure a port as “no switchport”. No IP configuration needed. Set the “tftp source interface <>”. Now defaulting the interface causes this issue.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub38559

Symptoms: When static recursive routes are used in an MVPNv6 environment, multicast traffic loss can occur due to failure to determine the correct RPF interface for a multicast source or rendezvous point.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if a static route to an IPv6 address at a remote site (remote side of a VPN cloud) resolves via a BGP route, resulting in a failure to install the required MDT alternate next-hop in the recursively referenced BGP route.

Workaround: Executing “show ipv6 rpf vrf X <address>” for any address within the recursively referenced BGP prefix range will cause installation of the required alternate next-hop.

* CSCub39296

Symptoms: Unexpected exception to CPU: vector 200, PC = 0x0. Traceback decode is irrelevant.

Conditions: The symptom is observed on the ES+ series linecards on a Cisco 7600 series router. Symptom is reported on the ES+ console and in the crashinfo file on the ES+ flash disk. It is not reported in the syslog.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub41835

Symptoms: IGMP snooping debugs get turned on automatically.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the console is flooded with debug messages.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub42181

Symptoms: The router crashes continuously after a normal reboot due to power or some other reason.

---------------------------------------------------

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) MGCP gateway.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Take out all the modules from the router.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Put the modules one by one.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Apply the configuration.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The router is stable.

The lab test recreated as follows:

 1. Disable auto-configuration, that is, “no ccm-manager config”.

 2. Reload the gateway.

 3. Enable the CCM manager configuration and the router does not crash.

Workaround 1: Bypass the start-up configuration and log in via ROMmon without any configuration. Add the configuration one by one. Once the configuration is added, save the configuration and reload the gateway.

Workaround 2: Shut down the router and add the cards one by one in slots 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The device is stable until the third slot is inserted and brought up. As soon the router is powered on, after adding the fourth slot, the crash starts. Shut down the router and remove the card in slot 4 (EVM-HD-8FXS/DID). Bring the device up without the card in slot 4 (EVM-HD-8FXS/DID). Remove the “mgcp” and “ccm-manager fallback-mgcp” configuration from the device because the console log is displaying the “Call Manager backhaul registration failed” error message. Shut down the router and add the card which was removed. Bring up the router. Readd the ccm-manager fallback-mgcp command and do a “no mgcp/mgcp”. The router becomes stable.

Workaround 3: Remove the ccm-manager config command by no ccm-manager config which tears down the connection from the call manager to the MGCP gateway. The gateway will not download the configuration from the call agent at the time of startup. Reload the router. Once the router is back and stable, readd the command.

* CSCub44898

Symptoms: Stale scansafe sessions are seen on the router. They do not get cleared even with the clear content-scan sessions \* command.

Conditions: This issue occurs when one of the end points (client or server) does not properly close the connection. In TCP terms, when one end does not send an ACK to the FIN request sent by the other end in L4F UNPROXIED state.

Workaround: There is no workaround. The router needs to be rebooted to clear the stale sessions.

* CSCub45054

Symptoms: OQD drop counters increment on the mGRE tunnel even though there are no drops.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with an mGRE tunnel when multicast traffic is sent over the tunnel. This issue is seen when EIGRP or OSPF is configured on the tunnel.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub45763

Symptoms: The switch may crash following SYS-2-FREEFREE and SYS-6-MTRACE messages while a CDP frame is being processed.

Conditions: device crash

Workaround: Disable CDP using “no cdp run”.

* CSCub46423

Symptoms: Connecting from Windows 7 L2TP/IPSec client to the VPN fails when using HSRP virtual IP as a gateway IP and Error 788 is displayed.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(3)T or later releases, and the Windows 7 L2TP/IPsec VPN client.

Workaround: Downgrade to Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)T.

* CSCub46570

Symptoms: The image cannot be built with an undefined symbol.

Conditions: This symptom occurs as the commit error triggers the compiling issue.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub48120

Symptoms: Sp crash is observed @oce\_to\_sw\_obj\_type on a router reload.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with core link flap at remote end during IP- FRR cutover.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub49291

Symptoms: Static tunnels between hubs and spokes fail to rebuild.

Conditions: The symptom is observed when you reload the hub on the DMVPN IPv6 setup with DPD on-demand enabled on all spokes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub49768

Symptoms: Trifecta may crash with watchdog timeout. No crashinfo is generated without this fix.

Conditions: This symptom can occur whenever there is a ROMmon read or write.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub49985

Symptoms: MPLS pseudowire ping from the peer to the Cisco ASR 903 fails if the peer is using TTL-based ping.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the peer is using TTL-based ping.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub52825

Symptoms: The negotiated global IPv6 remains intact on the Dialer interface.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the physical interface goes down.

Workaround: Remove the global IPv6 address manually from the Dialer interface.

* CSCub52943

Symptoms: When executing Media Forking with midcall codec change, memory leaks are found in Cisco ASR for CCSIP\_SPI\_CONTROL. After decoding, the memory leak is found to be for the function is\_x\_participant\_sips() as it is not releasing the memory after allocated with some memory. This seems to be a side effect of one of the DDTS that was committed to Cisco IOS Release 15.3M&T (CSCtz96408).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when executing Media Forking with midcall codec change.

Workaround: The fix is done and is committed to Cisco IOS Release 15.3M&T.

* CSCub54261

Symptoms: In an MLDP + MVPNv6 setup, abnormal RP reload occurs after the deletion and addition of few subinterfaces on the encapsulated PE.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after deletion and addition of few subinterfaces on the router acting as the encapsulated PE on the access side for a few VRFs running MLCP inband.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub56064

Symptoms: Ping fails after doing EZVPN client connect if CEF is enabled.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the Cisco IOS Release 15.3(0.8)T image. This issue is seen only for a specific topology, where the in/out interface is the same.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub56206

Symptoms: Traffic drop might be seen after reloading the router.

Conditions: This symptom is observed on a particular SFP interface (the issue is seen on ge0/8) after reloading the router.

Workaround: Shut/no-shut of the interface or clearing the IPv6 neighbor will recover the traffic.

* CSCub58312

Symptoms: When IGMP query with source IP address 0.0.0.0 is received on an interface, it is marked as mrouter port for that VLAN.

Router#show ip igmp int vlan 1

Vlan1 is up, line protocol is up

 IGMP querying router is 0.0.0.0 <----

Router#sh ip igmp snooping mrouter

vlan ports

-----+----------------------------------------

 1 Po1,Po8,Router<-----

Conditions: This symptom is seen when IGMP query with source IP address 0.0.0.0 is received.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub58483

Symptom: The radius-server attribute 6 on-for-login-auth command is not configurable any more.

Conditions: There are no specific conditions under which this issue occurs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub59493

Symptoms: The CPU remains at 100% after the SNMPv 2c walk even after 5 minutes.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when an SNMP walk is done on mplsLsrStdMIB.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub60422

Symptoms: ME-3600X-24CX-M Box crashes on executing the command “Diagnostic start test all”.

Conditions: On executing “Diagnostic start test all” command.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub60678

Symptoms: Standby RSP is periodically reset after memory exhaustion. This can be checked by checking free memory on standby SP by the show memory statistic command.

Conditions: This symptom is triggered by standby RSP restart or router reload.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub62897

Symptoms: SVI is not coming up for a long time even there are active ports in that VLAN.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with flexlink with preemption and VLAN load balance configuration.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub67101

Symptoms: The POS interface line protocol is down with encapsulation PPP in an MPLS setup.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when configuring encapsulation PPP on both ends of PE1 and CE1, and then configuring xconnect in the customer-facing interface of PE1.

Workaround: Reconfigure the xconnect settings. Then, the interface will come up in the proper state.

* CSCub68069

Symptoms: Standby RP crash is seen on the Cisco ASR 1000 BRAS during the longevity test.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a full scale churn test, with 28K PPPoEoA sessions with two ISG Services on each session, and the LI activated on 500 sessions, with 40cps churn rate.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub68933

Symptoms: Incorrect MAC learning is observed over pseudowires that are part of HVPLS, causing traffic failure.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when VPLS autodiscovery is in use, with MPLS over SVI in the core. This issue is also seen with LDP-based VPLS, when split horizon-enabled pseudowires are configured after the non-split horizon-enabled pseudowires.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub70336

Symptoms: The router can crash when “clear ip bgp \*” is done in a large-scale scenario.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only in a large-scale scenario, with ten of thousands of peers and several VPNv4/v6 prefixes.

Workaround: “clear ip bgp \*” is not a very common operation. Hence, this issue has not been observed by customers. The crash can only happen when “clear ip bgp \*” is done. The workaround is not to execute “clear ip bgp \*”.

* CSCub71981

Symptoms: The show voice register pool on-hold brief command displays the same number (for both phone number and remote number) when both local and remote phone are put on-hold.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when with Cisco IOS Release 15.3(8)T.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub72198

Symptoms: CLI being executed failed to sync to standby and results in standby reload.

Conditions: This happens when the following conditions are met:

 1. Active and standby are running different version of IOS image.

 2. The CLI being applied is not PRC compliant. Meaning that this CLI does not return a valid parser return code.

Workaround: Avoid applying CLIs that are not PRC compliant during image upgrade or downgrade.

* CSCub73159

Symptoms: IOSD crash is seen.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when bringing up 8000 PPP sessions with QOS and eBGP routes.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub73177

Symptoms: RP crash occurs.

Conditions: This symptom occurs upon router reload

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub73787

Symptoms: The RSP720 may crash if a high rate of traffic is punted to the RP.

Conditions: This symptom occurs on a Cisco 7600 with RSP720. It is specific to a driver used only by the RSP720. Other supervisor models are not affected. The issue is only seen in Cisco IOS Release 15.1(03)S and later releases, because of a code change made to the RSP720 driver.

Workaround: Isolate and stop the traffic being punted to the RP.

* CSCub74272

Symptoms: Intermittently during Phase II rekey, after new SPIs are negotiated and inserted into SPD, old SPIs are removed and then the VTI tunnel line protocol goes down.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.2(3)T, with VTI over GRE.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub76135

Symptoms: In the Cisco ASR 903, during SSO, the age of some of the ARP entries gets corrupted.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the Cisco ASR 903.

Workaround: It has been observed that for few ARP entries the value of timeout gets corrupted during SSO. As of now, the following workaround has been done for the corrupted timeout ARP entries:

 1. The refresh timer is set to the configured value.

 2. The router sends an ARP request for the corrupted entries.

* CSCub78299

Symptoms: Ping fails from host1 (192.168.1.2) to host2 (192.168.4.2).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when Suite-B is configured on IPsec sa.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub78917

Symptoms: PIM VRF neighbor is not coming up.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with MVPNv6 configurations.

Workaround: Use earlier images.

* CSCub79035

Symptoms: Multicast traffic drops over the IPSec GRE tunnel.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the mls mpls tunnel-recir command is configured on the router.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub79102

Symptoms: Router crashes with MVPNv6 setup.

Conditions: This symptom is seen while unconfiguring VRF.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub79318

Symptoms: Codec changes spontaneously during midsession without a RE-INVITE.

Conditions: This symptom occurs with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Fax passthrough is configured.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Codec negotiated is G711alaw, and changes to G729.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub79590

Symptoms: The match user-group commands do not appear in the running configuration after being configured.

Configure an inspection type class-map:

class-map type inspect TEST

 match protocol tcp

 match user-group cisco

Save the configuration. Try to view the configuration in the running configuration:

hostname# show run class-map

building configuration...

Current configuration : 66 bytes

!

class-map type inspect match-all TEST

 match protocol tcp

end

But, view the configuration directly in the class-map:

hostname# show class-map type inspect

 Class Map type inspect match-all TEST (id 1)

 Match protocol tcp

 Match user-group cisco

The configuration never shows up in the running configuration, but it is in the class-map configuration. As a note, the functionality exists on the ZBFW, but the configuration does not show up in the running configuration.

Conditions: This symptom is only observed with the match user-group commands.

Workaround: This issue only affects devices after a reload as the router will read the startup configuration, which will not have the match user-group command. As a result, the match user-group commands need to be reentered after ever reload.

* CSCub80386

Symptoms: The following interface configuration should be used:

interface Ethernet2/1

description lanethernet1

ipv6 enable

ospfv3 100 network manet

ospfv3 100 ipv6 area 0

Dead interval is calculated according to network type; in this case, it is 120s. Issue the no ospfv3 dead-interval command on dead interval. Dead interval is set to the default of 40s instead of 120s, which is correct for manet or P2MP interface types.

Conditions: This symptom is an OSPFv3-specific issue (see the configuration example).

Workaround: Configure dead interval explicitly or reapply the network command.

* CSCub80491

Symptoms: A Cisco router may experience alignment errors. These alignment errors may then cause high CPU.

Conditions: This symptom occurs as the alignment errors require using Get VPN. It is currently believed to be related to having the Get VPN running on a multilink interface, but this is not yet confirmed.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub80654

Symptoms: Randomly, there is no audio if a call comes from the following call flow using G729:

IP Phone -- CUCM -- ICT GK Controlled -- GK -- CME 9.1 -- Phone A and B

If one of the phones in CME tries to GPickup the call randomly, it will have no audio. When this happens, if you check the codec directly in the phone, it is G711. However, when it works, it is G729. Everything is configured for G729. Even if you hard code the phone in CME to use G729, this issue will occur. This issue does not occur in CME 7.1.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if a call comes from GK as G729 and CME 9.1 is being used.

Workaround: Use CME 7.1 or enable fast start in CUCM Trunk by enabling the following check boxes:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Media Termination Point Required

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Enable Outbound FastStart

* CSCub80710

Symptoms: SSL handshake between Cisco VCS and the Cisco ASR fails if the Cisco ASR is running Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7S.

Conditions: This symptom occurs in a working setup, if the Cisco ASR is upgraded to Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7S, then SSL handshake and subsequently SIP-TLS calls start to fail. If in the same setup, the Cisco ASR is downgraded back to Cisco IOS XE Release 3.5S or Cisco IOS XE Release 3.4.4S, then the calls work (without requiring any additional changes).

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub82227

Symptoms: NTP broadcast mode does not work on the Cisco ASR 901 (client).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the Cisco ASR 901 does not receive NTP “broadcast” messages from the NTP server.

Workaround: Use NTP unicast mode.

* CSCub82471

Symptoms: BFD session flapping occurs or fails to get established on flapping REP ring.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the software BFD session or echo mode.

Workaround: Disable echo mode.

* CSCub83760

Symptoms: DSCP-based WRED does not work in egress on the member-link. This is a regression caused due to CSCty30952.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a policy (not only WRED) is applied on an Etherchannel and a trunk port with allowed VLAN none is a member-link. This issue is seen because there is a new internal handling to take care of switchport trunk and access cases by CSCty30952 to handle VLAN combinations.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub85416

Symptoms: Router crashes with G8302 configs.

Conditions: 11k eompls vc and G8302 configs.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub85451

Symptoms: When scan safe is enabled on the interface, latency may be seen. Some pages may not load at all or show severe latency if the SYN request sent by the ISR does not receive an appropriate SYN ACK response from the Scan Safe Tower.

Conditions: Scan Safe must be enabled on the interface. In this case, there was an ASA in the path that was doing sequence number randomization.

Workaround: Disable sequence number randomization on the firewall in the path before the ISR.

PSIRT Evaluation: The Cisco PSIRT has assigned this bug the following CVSS version 2 score. The Base and Temporal CVSS scores as of the time of evaluation are 4.3/4.1:

* CSCub86706

Symptoms: After multiple RP switchover, the router crashes with the “UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = BGP HA SSO” error.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with MVPN with 500 VRFs, when performing multiple switchovers on PE1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub87579

Symptoms: Multicast traffic gets forwarded to the wrong tunnel protected with IPsec.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when Multicast (PIM) is enabled on the GRE tunnel protected with IPsec on the Cisco 7600.

Workaround: Shut/no shut on the tunnel protected with IPsec resolves the issue.

* CSCub88742

Symptoms: A crash occurs due to NULL pointer access in a BGP C-Route function.

Conditions: This symptom is very timing-sensitive and will occur only in a specific sequence of runtime events in a specific timing instance. In this case, this issue is triggered in a scaled setup when “mpls mldp” is toggled after two SSOs and when each SSO takes a very long time to complete due to HA Bulk Sync failure in IP Multicast that has addresses separately.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCub88833

Symptoms: Running the clear ip access-list dynamic counters command triggers spurious memory access and adds traceback information in the logging buffer of the Cisco uBR router.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Smap - Smap. Removal of CLI does not remove the static route.

Workaround: Remove the ACL before removing the SA.

* CSCuc47399

Symptoms: IKEv2 STOP Accounting records show wrong counters for packets/octets, when the sessions are locally cleared using “clear crypto sa” or “clear crypto session” on ASR1K.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with latest Cisco IOS XE Release 3.8S images when IKEV2-Accounting is enabled. This issue is easily reproducible with a single session, and may be service impacting as STOP Accounting records are usually used for billing purposes.

Workaround: The STOP records reflect the right counters when the disconnect is through the remote-end.

* CSCuc47879

Symptoms: Removing the channel group configuration on a CEM controller causes the device to hang in a particular scenario.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the following steps are performed: (a) Configure CEM group (CESoPSN or SAToP) on a controller (b) Configure channel group on this controller with same time slots used in (a) for CEM group (c) Remove channel group configured in step (b)

Workaround: Perform hard reboot of the device.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when EFP is admin down.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc48211

Symptoms: Traffic from the Label Edge Router (LER) is dropped at the Label Switch Router (LSR) peer. LER is using a invalid/outdated label, unknown to LSR. This issue can be seen with a regular MPLS connection over a physical interface or with a connection over an MPLS TE tunnel interface. The root cause is that LER is using CEF long-path extension, installed to the prefix by a different routing protocol in the past.

* CSCuc55346

Symptoms: SNMP MIB cbQosCMDropPkt and cbQosCMDropByte report 0.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS Release 15.1(3)S1 and Cisco IOS Release 15.2. This issue is not seen with Cisco IOS Release SRE4.

Workaround: Use SNMP MIB cbQosPoliceExceededPkt and cbQosPoliceExceededByte.

* CSCuc55634

Symptoms: IPv6 static route cannot resolve the destination.

Conditions:

 1. A VRF is configured by the old style CLI (for example “ip vrf RED”).

 2. Configure “ip vrf forwarding RED” under an interface.

 3. Configure IPv6 address under the same interface (for example 2001:192:44:1::2/64).

 4. Configure IPv6 static route via the interface configured in item 3, (for example IPv6 route 2001:192:14:1::/64 2001:192:44:1::1).

 5. Then, we are not able to ping the 2001:192:14:1::2 although we can reach 2001:192:44:1::1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc56259

Symptoms: A Cisco 3945 that is running 15.2(3)T2 and running as a voice gateway may crash. Just prior to the crash, these messages can be seen:

After the reload from the crash, it may take some time before it crashes again.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when CUBE receives the SIP REFER message with the Refer-To header having no user part.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc70310

Symptoms: RRI routes are not installed in DMAP. “reverse-route” is a configuration in the DMAP. This prevents packets from being routed through the intended interface, and hence packet loss occurs.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when a simple reverse-route is configured in DMAP without any gateway options.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc71493

Symptoms: Significant transaction time degradation is observed when an e-mail with attachment(s) is sent from the Windows 7 client using Outlook to a server running Outlook 2010 on the Windows 2008 server and the WAN latency is low, that is, ~12ms RTT.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the client is Windows 7 and data is being uploaded using the MAPI protocol and the connection is being optimized by WAAS-Express.

Workaround: Disable WAAS-Express.

* CSCuc71706

Symptoms: Execution of the show run command and other commands such as copy run start and show access-list cause the router to stop for a few minutes before completing.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco ISR G2 routers. This issue is seen only with IPV6 configured and used.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc72244

Symptoms: On the Cisco 7600, both sides running Cisco IOS Release SRE4, Ethernet SPA configured with “negotiation Auto” and changed to “no negotiation auto”. The interface is operating in half-duplex instead of full-duplex mode.

Conditions: This is a timing issue seen when configuring/un-configuring auto-negotiation or when doing continuous router reload.

Recovery action: Configuring “shut” and “no shut” on the interface changes the duplex state to full-duplex.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc73473

Symptoms: The IPv6 default route is not redistributed in BGP(VRF).

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the OSPFv3 “default-information originate always” is configured in the same VRF.

Workaround: To clear the issue, enter “cle ip bg \*”. To avoid the issue, remove “default-information originate always” from OSPFv3 in the respective VRF.

* CSCuc73677

Symptoms: RSA keys are not generated correctly.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when you first clear the RSA keys that are already generated on the router, and then generate the RSA keys.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc76130

Symptoms: IPsec SAs are not getting deleted even after removing ACL.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when using the IPsec feature with Cisco IOS Release 15.3(0.18)T0.1.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc76298

Symptoms: In ASR B2B HA setup, the new active router crashes at ccsip\_send\_ood\_options\_ping immediately after switchover with OOD OPTIONS enabled.

Conditions: This crash is seen in the following scenario:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Standby router has OOD OPTIONS enabled either because it is present in startup configuration or enabled after boot-up.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Next, disable OOD OPTIONS.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Switchover happens.

Workaround: Reload standby router once after OOD OPTIONS configuration changes from enabled to disabled.

* CSCuc76309

Symptom: Crash on rp2 : be\_ip\_arp\_retry\_

Conditions: None

Workaround: Disable arp retry feature. To disable arp retry feature following two commands are needed:  **no ip arp incomplete enable** and  **no ip arp incomplete retry**.

* CSCuc76515

Symptoms: Xconnect fails to negotiate to the correct vc-type on reload.

Conditions: This symptom is seen in vc-type4 session.

Workaround: Clear xconnect peer.

* CSCuc76670

Symptoms: 2X1GE-SYNCE (metronome) SPA does not boot on a 2RU (Cisco ASR 1002).

Conditions: This symptom is observed with Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7S onwards, when metronome SPA (2X1GE-SYNCE) fails to boot on a 2RU. An error message indicating that the SPA is not supported is displayed on the RP console.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc77283

Symptoms: Upon reload or OIR, the CFM MEP configuration on an xconnect EFP is removed and cannot be reconfigured.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with a CFM MEP on xconnect service instance. This issue is seen when reload or OIR is performed.

Workaround: Remove the domain configuration.

* CSCuc77704

Symptoms: The GETVPN/GDOI Secondary Cooperative Key Server (COOP-KS) does not download the policy (that is, when the show crypto gdoi ks policy command is issued on the Secondary COOP-KS and the command output shows that no policy is downloaded) and Group Members (GMs) registering to the Secondary COOP-KS fail to register without any warning/error message.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the GETVPN/GDOI group (with COOP configured) has an IPsec profile configured with one of the following transforms in its transform-set:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) esp-sha256-hmac

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) esp-sha384-hmac

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) esp-sha512-hmac

Workaround: Use esp-sha-hmac as the authentication transform instead.

* CSCuc78328

Symptoms: Randomly, when the below condition is met, SP crashes followed by RP reset.

Conditions: Multicast enabled (PIM) on the tunnels protected with IPsec.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc79161

Symptoms: Memory leak is observed.

Conditions: This symptom occurs after flapping the interface, keeping the setup idle, and executing “clear xconnect”.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Further Problem Description: The PI front-end pseudoport is not deleted when the xconnect is removed, which causes the memory leak. This issue occurs because PD returns BDOMAIN\_PP\_FAILED to PI when pp\_engine\_context is a NULL pointer.

* CSCuc79923

Symptoms: On a Cisco 7600 running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1, packets from FWSM are dropped when the servicemodule session is enabled. Ping fails for the VLAN interface on the FWSM module from the supervisor. The ARP entry is incomplete on the Cisco 7600.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with the following conditions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) This issue is seen on the Cisco 7600 with FWSM and SUP-720-3B running Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S1.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The FWSM is in Crossbar mode.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) The system is in “distributed” egress SPAN replication mode.

This issue is not seen with Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRE7.

Workaround:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Disable the servicemodule session.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Change the fabric switching mode to bus.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) Change SPAN egress replication mode to “centralized”.

* CSCuc82224

Symptoms: When a dynamic-EID host moves from one site to another, the hosts at the old site may not be able to communicate with the host that moved away.

Conditions: This symptom occurs if the xTR at the old site had a map-cache entry for the dynamic-EID host that moved, for example, due to lig self. Then, this map-cache entry prevents communication after the dynamic-EID host moved away.

Workaround: Clear the map-cache entry for the host prefix in question.

* CSCuc82551

Symptoms: A Cisco ASR 1001 running Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.2S or Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7.1S crashes with SNMP traffic.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with SNMP polling with an IP SLA configuration.

The crash signature is as follows:

UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = SNMP ENGINE

Workaround: Remove the SNMP configuration from the router or schedule the probe before polling via SNMP.

* CSCuc83104

Symptoms: Path confirmation fails for blind transfer scenarios for both SIP Line and trunk-side scenarios.

Conditions: This symptom is observed if “no supplementary-service sip refer” is configured.

Workaround: Configure “supplementary-service sip refer”.

* CSCuc85810

Symptoms: A VRF cannot be deleted from CLI.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when “no ipv6 pim vrf <vrf name> rp-address <ipv6 address>” is entered immediately after “no vrf definition <vrf name>”

Workaround: After “no vrf definition <vrf name>”, do not enter “no ipv6 pim vrf <vrf name> rp-address <ipv6 address>”, until VRF deletion is completed.

* CSCuc87208

Symptoms: The router crashes while configuring inherit peer-session.

Conditions: A peer-session template is inheriting from another peer-session template where the inherited template has the “ha-mode sso” configured. For example:

router bgp 1

 template peer-session ps.rmtAS.10000

 remote-as 10000

 exit-peer-session

 template peer-session ps.rmtAS.10000.sso

 inherit peer-session ps.rmtAS.10000

 ha-mode sso

 exit-peer-session

 template peer-session ps.rmtAS.10000.sso.bfd

 inherit peer-session ps.rmtAS.10000.sso

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc88175

Symptoms: When a dynamic cryptomap is used on the Virtual Template interface, SAs do not created and thus the testscripts fail. This issue occurs because the crypto map configurations are not added to the NVGEN, and hence there is no security policy applied on the Virtual Template interface.

Conditions: This symptom occurs only when a dynamic map is used on the Virtual Template interface. However, this issue is not seen when tunnel protection is used on the Virtual Template interface or when a dynamic map is used on the typical physical interface.

Workaround: There is no workaround apart from using tunnel protection on the Virtual Template interface.

* CSCuc88312

Symptoms: A memory leak is seen at cca\_realloc\_cb\_ce\_mask.

Conditions: This happens when CCA is configured on multiple interfaces and one of them is brought down.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc90011

Symptoms: Memory leak is caused by executing “show vpdn history failure” after PPP authentication failure.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when executing the “show vpdn history failure” CLI.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc90061

Symptoms: Attaching the QoS policy on EFP with rewrite action as ingress rewrite push was not supported previously. Now, policy with only class-default can be attached to these EFPs.

Conditions: This symptom is observed only for EFPs with rewrite action configured as ingress rewrite push.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc90580

Symptoms: Ping fails over RoutedPW.

Conditions: This symptom is seen with SVI based MPLS uplink.

Workaround: Disable mac learning.

* CSCuc91582

Symptoms: Adding EFP to Bridge-Domain fails and errors are seen when reloading with Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7.1a.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when reloading the Cisco ASR 903 with Cisco IOS XE Release 3.7.1a, when EFP and PW are in the same Bridge-Domain.

Workaround: Post reload, remove the EFP configurations, and configure PW first and then EFP.

* CSCuc92167

Symptoms: SSH use of Diffie-Hellman exchange to negotiate keying material is insecure and may lower the security of Diffie-Helman exchange.

Conditions: There are known attacks against DH that takes effort of the effectively halving the length of the private key. Due to SSH use of DH private values of certain lengths, if the SSH is negotiated using AES-128 and HMAC-MD5, the time needed to recover the keys is lower than expected.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when the PTP processor is enabled.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc93361

Symptoms: “ip” protocol is not accepted in the ping command with the IPv6 address configured.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when a single interface is configured with an IP address, and later, the mask alone is changed. For example:

int e0/0

ip addr 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0

no shut

Later,

int e0/0

ip addr 10.1.1.1 255.255.0.0

Workaround: Configure a different IP address and then revert to the same address with the changed mask. For example:

int e0/0

ip addr 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0

no shut

Later,

* CSCuc93739

Symptoms: Phase 2 for EzVPN client with split network and VTI does not come up if IPsec SA goes down.

Conditions: The root cause of the issue is that IPsec SA is not being triggered after IPsec SA is down due to no traffic. So in spite of traffic IPsec SA is not coming up leading to packet drops in client network. The same problem is not seen with Cisco IOS Release 15.0(1)M7. This behavior is introduced post-PAL where virtual-interface creates a ruleset where traffic cannot trigger IPsec SA again once IPsec SA is deleted.

Workaround 1: Configure “ip sla” on EZVPN client for split networks, so IPsec SA will not go down.

Workaround 2: Remove “virtual-interface” from EZVPN client profile if that is not needed.

Further Problem Description: The problem is not seen in Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)M1 without virtual-interface.

* CSCuc94687

* CSCuc95160

Symptoms: After receiving the CRCX message, the Cisco AS5400 does not send 200 ok to SSW. SSW sends the CRCX message to the Cisco AS5400 again. Between these messages, debug outputs are displayed. It seems that the call is not disconnected completely for the end point by the previous disconnect request (the DLCX is received after the CRCX message from SSW). The end point may be stuck in call\_disconnecting state.

Conditions: This symptom is observed with MGCP. This issue occurs when the Cisco AS5400 receives DLCX before sending 200 ok for the first CRCX message.

Workaround: There is no workaround.

* CSCuc96241

* CSCud08166

Symptoms: The Cisco ASR 1000 router crashes with “Exception to IOS Thread” and the following error: “UNIX-EXT-SIGNAL: Segmentation fault(11), Process = Virtual Exec”

Conditions: This symptom is observed when an ACL used with “ip pim rp-address” is moved from standard to extended and “no ip multicast-routing” is configured (either in global or in a mVRF). The standard ACL must be deleted and recreated as extended, for example:

The following series of commands are necessary to trigger the crash:

<begin-config>

!

ip multicast-routing

!

ip pim rp-address 10.200.255.42 STATIC-RP-LN-SERVER-FARMS override

!

no ip access-list standard STATIC-RP-LN-SERVER-FARMS

ip access-list extended STATIC-RP-LN-SERVER-FARMS

 remark -- STATIC RP LN SERVER FARMS MCAST GROUP ACL --

 permit ip 239.255.0.0 0.0.255.255 any

 permit ip 224.0.0.0 15.255.255.255 any

!

!

no ip multicast-routing

<end-config>

Workaround: Crash can be prevented by any of the following methods:

 1. Disassociate the standard ACL from “ip pim rp-address” before deleting ACL. For example.

no ip pim rp-address 10.200.255.42 STATIC-RP-LN-SERVER-FARMS override

 and then

 no ip access-list standard STATIC-RP-LN-SERVER-FARMS

 2. Do not convert a standard ACL to extended while it is still being referenced in “ip pim rp-address”. Use a new name for the new extended ACL.

 3. Do not disable multicast routing using “no ip multicast-routing”.

* CSCud08595

Workaround: Remove the service instance and reconfigure with new rewrite tag to be pushed.

* CSCud31012

Symptoms: MVPNv6 is not working with IPservices image.

Conditions: This symptom is observed as MVPNv6 is supported only from Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S. So, this issue is applicable for any release after Cisco IOS Release 15.2(4)S.

Workaround: Use the enterprise image.

* CSCud31808

Symptoms: With the two commands configured listed under the conditions of this release note, the Cisco router might start advertising a low TCP receive window size to the TCP peer for a specific TCP transaction. The value of this receive window size becomes equal to the configured MSS value, and it will never exceed this value anymore. This might impact TCP performance.

Conditions: This symptom happens only if the following two commands are configured on the router:

ip tcp mss x

ip tcp path-mtu-discovery

Workaround: Either change the path-mtu discovery ager timeout to 0, or remove one of the two commands.

* CSCud32967

Symptoms: Standby crash after doing account-logon with v4 session.

 1. When you have L2PT EVC along with non-L2PT EVCs on the same interface or port-channel interface.

 2. On LC OIR or reload, the L2PT packets does not get tunneled.

Workaround: Remove and add the L2PT config on the EVC.

* CSCud33564

Symptoms: BFD sessions are not offloaded.

Conditions: This symptom occurs when XDR infra creates a split event for an XDR mcast\_grp and the BFD client ignores it. For this bug, the reason for the split is that a slot is not able to process messages as fast as other slots, thus causing distribution for all slots to block while it catches up. This issue typically occurs with either of the following conditions:

 1. The slot has a slower CPU than the others.

 2. The amount of work being down during processing of messages is greater than on other slots.

Workaround: Reload ES+ cards.

* CSCud33887

Conditions: This symptom occurs when the system runs out of memory after churning for a couple hours.

Workaround: Reboot the system to recover memory.

* CSCud38038

Symptom: The router records incorrect delay measurements after a reload.

Conditions: Occurs under the following conditions: You configure Delay Measurement Message (DMM) on a port-channel interface The port-channel member links are on different interface modules (IMs) You reload the router.

Workaround: You can use the following workarounds: Remove the ethernet cfm global command and re-apply it after the port-channel member links recover. Configure PTP clock synchronization.

* CSCud38774

Symptoms: Router is showing CPU utilization at 99%. LDAP seems to be hogging the CPU process.

Conditions: This issue can occur randomly at any point of time where NTLM authentication is deployed. This issue is observed only when the server is not able to handle the churn of requests and requests are being stuck at Bind On-Going state, which can be verified with show ldap server server-name connections.

Workaround: Clearing LDAP server connections helps in resolving this issue:

clear ldap server server-name.

* CSCud42938

Symptoms: After a clear crypto session, sometimes ident SM remains at responder side.

Conditions: Doing a clear crypto session multiple times, crypto map deletes but ident remains due to race condition between new connections also coming up. Since map is removed and ident remains, the new connections never come up.

Workaround: Router reboot.

* CSCud43620

Symptoms: The Gateway fails to send ACK after 200 OK while testing DNS/SRV Lookup on a VOIP peer with weight/priority.

Conditions: This symptom is observed when a Cisco router is loaded with c2900-universalk9-mz.SSA.153-1.7.T image.
