Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `gnome-keyring` application fails to properly adhere to its configuration settings related to caching GPG passphrases. Specifically, when the `gpg-cache-method` is set to "idle" or "timeout", the passphrase is not expired as configured, leading to indefinite caching.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Caching:** The core issue is that the `gnome-keyring` does not limit the duration a GPG passphrase is cached, contrary to the intended behavior of the "idle" and "timeout" methods.
- **Configuration Bypass:** The application fails to respect user-defined cache expiration times set via the `gpg-cache-ttl` setting.
- **Regression:** Upstream analysis suggests this is a regression from version 3.3.x of `gnome-keyring`, although older versions could also be affected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain unauthorized access to GPG keys by exploiting the indefinite caching.
- An attacker could use these keys to sign, decrypt or encrypt data, depending on the permissions associated to the compromised GPG keys.
- The "unspecified impact" mentioned in the CVE description can be interpreted as the broad range of malicious activities an attacker could perform with access to the compromised GPG keys.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through local access or compromised user sessions where `gnome-keyring` is actively used.
- An attacker who has gained access to a user's session can potentially use the cached GPG keys without needing the passphrase again.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to use the user's GPG keys, either by local access to the user's account or by compromising the user's session.
- The attacker does not need to know the GPG passphrase itself, because the vulnerability allows to re-use cached credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue affects `gnome-keyring` versions 3.4.0 and 3.4.1.
- Patches have been created and pushed to resolve the issue, which involve correctly hooking up the TTL (time-to-live) cache option and marking secret items as used when accessed.
- The fix involves correcting the handling of the 'idle' and 'timeout' methods for GPG passphrase caching.
- The vulnerability is considered a "low" severity issue by Red Hat.
