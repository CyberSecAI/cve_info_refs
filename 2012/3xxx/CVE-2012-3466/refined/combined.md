The "idle" and "timeout" values do not appear to work as they should, after the timeout I was able to use GPG without entering my password. To test:  gsettings set org.gnome.crypto.cache gpg-cache-method 'idle' gsettings set org.gnome.crypto.cache gpg-cache-ttl 60  then use gpg/gpg2 to sign something, you should be prompted for your gpg password. Then leave it idle, the session should timeout after 60 seconds. Try signing something again, you are not prompted for the password.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=845426#c4)  Huzaifa S.

Date: Thu, 2 Aug 2012 16:47:23 +0200

[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=683655;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: gnome-keyring
Version: 3.4.1-4
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

At some point gnome-keyring seemed to obey the configuration asking it
to stop caching passphrases after a while.  It no longer does.

$ gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.crypto.cache
org.gnome.crypto.cache gpg-cache-authorize false
org.gnome.crypto.cache gpg-cache-method 'idle'
org.gnome.crypto.cache gpg-cache-ttl 600

Yet I'm never asked for the passphrase again.

Cheers,
Julien

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c0)  Laurent Bigonville    2012-08-02 15:53:56 UTC  ``` Hi,  The following bug has been reported on the Debian BTS:  =====8<====  At some point gnome-keyring seemed to obey the configuration asking it to stop caching passphrases after a while.  It no longer does.  $ gsettings list-recursively org.gnome.crypto.cache org.gnome.crypto.cache gpg-cache-authorize false org.gnome.crypto.cache gpg-cache-method 'idle' org.gnome.crypto.cache gpg-cache-ttl 600  Yet I'm never asked for the passphrase again.  =====8<====  An other person has also reported that he saw the same behavior with "org.gnome.crypto.cache gpg-cache-method 'timeout'"  For more information please see <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683655> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c1)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 04:08:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 220633](attachment.cgi?id=220633 "schema: Update description for gpg-cache-method") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=220633&action=edit "schema: Update description for gpg-cache-method") [[review]](review?bug=681081&attachment=220633) schema: Update description for gpg-cache-method   * Document the various method strings that can be present here ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c2)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 04:08:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 220634](attachment.cgi?id=220634 "gpg-agent: Hook up the TTL cache option") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=220634&action=edit "gpg-agent: Hook up the TTL cache option") [[review]](review?bug=681081&attachment=220634) gpg-agent: Hook up the TTL cache option   * So that when the gsettings gpg-cache-method is 'idle' or 'timeout'    we use gpg-cache-ttl to control how long the passphrase is cached    for.  * This is a regression from 3.3.x ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c3)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 04:09:15 UTC  ``` Would it be possible to try out the above patch and see if it fixes the problem for you? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c4)  Raphael Hertzog    2012-08-08 12:41:01 UTC  ``` I tested your patch with the "idle" method but it looks like "idle" is handled like "timeout". It does not reset the cache period everytime that you access the GPG key.  But at least there's again some automatic expiration because after the delay I had to re-enter my passphrase (as expected).  (BTW older versions had an option to require a confirmation before allowing the use of the GPG key, this was a nice option, it would be nice to have it back too) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c5)  Raphael Hertzog    2012-08-08 13:00:01 UTC  ``` In fact, reading the code I believe that the passphrase is now always cached for gpg-cache-ttl seconds as soon as gpg-cache-method is different from always. This means that the semantics of gpg-cache-method="session" (the default) changed.  And gpg-cache-ttl defaults to 300 (i.e. a non-zero value) so it affects everybody automatically.  (For reference I applied the patches on top of gnome-keyring 3.4.1 and that's the code I have been reading) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c6)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 13:30:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 220674](attachment.cgi?id=220674 "gpg-agent: Hook up the TTL cache option") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=220674&action=edit "gpg-agent: Hook up the TTL cache option") [[review]](review?bug=681081&attachment=220674) gpg-agent: Hook up the TTL cache option  * So that when the gsettings gpg-cache-method is 'idle' or 'timeout'    we use gpg-cache-ttl to control how long the passphrase is cached    for.  * This is a regression from 3.3.x ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c7)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 13:30:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 220675](attachment.cgi?id=220675 "secret-store: Mark a secret item as 'used' when accessed") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=220675&action=edit "secret-store: Mark a secret item as 'used' when accessed") [[review]](review?bug=681081&attachment=220675) secret-store: Mark a secret item as 'used' when accessed  * This makes the gpg-agent idle feature work correctly ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c8)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 13:32:12 UTC  ``` Thank you for the review :)  Indeed, both of those were broken. Could you test the two new attached patches?  Off hand, I believe that the code surrounding these patches hasn't changed that much since 3.4.x and that shouldn't be a problem. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c9)  Raphael Hertzog    2012-08-08 14:37:22 UTC  ``` It seems to work for me with those two patches. I tested the correct behaviour of "idle", "timeout" and "session".  Following the earlier code review, I still wonder what's the point of the gcr_prompt_get_choice_chosen() check since the prompt shown to the user (by GNOME Shell?) has no options at all to allow permanent storage of the passphrase... ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c10)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 14:45:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c9)) > Following the earlier code review, I still wonder what's the point of the > gcr_prompt_get_choice_chosen() check since the prompt shown to the user (by > GNOME Shell?) has no options at all to allow permanent storage of the > passphrase...  It does when the 'login' keyring is already unlocked, and thus the daemon is able to store the passphrase permanently in the login keyring. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c11)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 15:03:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c4)) > (BTW older versions had an option to require a confirmation before allowing the > use of the GPG key, this was a nice option, it would be nice to have it back > too)  Although it makes one feel good, this doesn't actually add any security. Any application can click the button via X to allow use of the GPG passphrase. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c12)  Julien Cristau    2012-08-08 15:11:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c11)) > Although it makes one feel good, this doesn't actually add any security.

Only if you let them use XTEST, AFAIK... ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c13)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 15:58:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c12)) > (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c11)) > > Although it makes one feel good, this doesn't actually add any security.

Plus XSendEvent lets an application send an event too. In addition there's no way to securely display the name of the application that wants to access the password (it'll always be gpg).   All that said, maybe it's not impossible after all... If someone wants to invest time and effort to implement this securely then I'd be willing to review patches. But I'm not really that interested in spending a lot of time for no real security gain, so it needs to actually perform its use case securely.  For example, see [bug #525574](show_bug.cgi?id=525574 "RESOLVED FIXED - gnome-keyring-daemon does not honor constrained ssh identities"). In that case with ssh, it does make sense to implement prompting because of SSH agent forwarding. Although it seems that nobody has had time to actually do it. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c14)  Stef Walter    2012-08-08 15:59:50 UTC  ``` [Attachment 220633](attachment.cgi?id=220633 "schema: Update description for gpg-cache-method") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=220633&action=edit "schema: Update description for gpg-cache-method") pushed as [3de11dd](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-keyring/commit/?id=3de11dd) - schema: Update description for gpg-cache-method [Attachment 220674](attachment.cgi?id=220674 "gpg-agent: Hook up the TTL cache option") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=220674&action=edit "gpg-agent: Hook up the TTL cache option") pushed as [111a132](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-keyring/commit/?id=111a132) - gpg-agent: Hook up the TTL cache option [Attachment 220675](attachment.cgi?id=220675 "secret-store: Mark a secret item as 'used' when accessed") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=220675&action=edit "secret-store: Mark a secret item as 'used' when accessed") pushed as [979bf3c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-keyring/commit/?id=979bf3c) - secret-store: Mark a secret item as 'used' when accessed ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c15)  Julien Cristau    2012-08-08 16:18:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c13)) > (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c12)) > > (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=681081#c11)) > > > Although it makes one feel good, this doesn't actually add any security.

So no it's not "always enabled".

Subject: CVE Request: gnome-keyring: improper caching of gpg password/passphrase

Hi All,

gnome-keyring does not obey the configuration asking it
to stop caching passphrases after a while.

More details and patches available at the following
references:

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=681081>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=845426>

Upstream bug suggests that this is a regression from 3.3.x.
But it seems some older versions may also be affected.

Can a CVE id be please assigned to this issue?

Thanks!
