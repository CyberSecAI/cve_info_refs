{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The RBX Gallery WordPress plugin (version 2.1) contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to lack of proper validation of uploaded files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary file upload vulnerability",
        "Lack of file validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts, to the server. This can lead to remote code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to the `uploader.php` script in the plugin directory.",
        "Attacker sends a specially crafted POST request containing the file to be uploaded."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the target server.  No authentication is needed.",
    "additional_information": "The provided exploit code uses `curl` to send a POST request with the file contents to the vulnerable uploader.php. Successful uploads of malicious PHP files such as lo.php or db.php will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. The exploit demonstrates how to upload two files at once, indicating that the plugin was vulnerable to multiple arbitrary file uploads."
