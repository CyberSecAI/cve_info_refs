Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3457:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure default permissions assigned to the `process_perfdata.cfg` file in PNP4Nagios versions 0.6 through 0.6.16. This configuration file is created with world-readable permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is that `process_perfdata.cfg` is world-readable, allowing any local user to access its content.
*   **Exposure of Shared Secret:** The `process_perfdata.cfg` file can contain the `KEY` option, which is used to store the Gearman shared secret. This secret is used for encryption of data packets.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By reading the `process_perfdata.cfg` file, a local attacker can obtain the Gearman shared secret.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Knowledge of the shared secret could allow an attacker to decrypt data packets, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the system where PNP4Nagios is installed. Any user with a local account on the affected system can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system running the vulnerable PNP4Nagios installation.
*   **File Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read the `process_perfdata.cfg` file, which is granted due to the world-readable permissions.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects PNP4Nagios versions 0.6 through 0.6.16.
*   The vulnerability is not present in version 0.4, which does not support the `KEY` option.
*   The fix involves changing the file permissions of `process_perfdata.cfg` to prevent unauthorized access.
*   The issue was fixed in version 0.6.19-1, which changed the permissions on the `process_perfdata.cfg` file to prevent world readable access.
