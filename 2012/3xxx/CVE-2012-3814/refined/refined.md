Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-3814:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress Font Uploader plugin (version 1.2.4) does not properly validate file uploads. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files, including PHP scripts, to the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The plugin lacks proper checks on the type and content of uploaded files.
- Lack of input validation: The plugin does not validate file extensions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Full system compromise: By gaining code execution, an attacker can potentially gain control of the entire web server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker uploads the malicious file through a POST request to the `font-upload.php` script of the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the target WordPress instance.
- No authentication or specific user privileges are required; the vulnerability is exploitable by any user able to reach the server.

**Additional Details**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to upload a PHP file by simulating a POST request to the vulnerable `font-upload.php` script with a filename ending in `.ttf`. This allows bypassing file extension restrictions in place and upload a malicious script
- The uploaded script is then accessible through a web browser allowing for remote code execution.
