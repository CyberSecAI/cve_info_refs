  "CVE-2012-3494": {
    "description": "set_debugreg allows writes to reserved bits of the DR7 debug control register on x86-64.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the `set_debugreg` hypercall allowing writes to reserved bits of the DR7 debug control register on x86-64.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation leading to writing to reserved debug register bits"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious guest can cause the host to crash, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).  Future hardware may widen the impact depending on how these reserved bits are assigned.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious guest operating system through hypercalls",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious guest OS with the ability to execute hypercalls."
    },
    "affected_systems": [
      "All systems running 64-bit paravirtualized guests",
      "Xen 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 RCs, and xen-unstable.hg"
    ],
      "mitigation": "Mitigation is possible by ensuring the guest kernel is trustworthy, or running only 32-bit or HVM guests."
