Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-3867:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue lies in the Puppet server's lack of proper validation of agent certificate names (specifically, the Common Name or CN field in Certificate Signing Requests - CSRs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Sanitization:** The Puppet server did not properly sanitize or validate the characters within the CN field of incoming CSRs.
*   **Misleading Display:** The vulnerability allowed for the use of ANSI control sequences in the certificate name which could be used to manipulate how the certificate name is displayed to an administrator, making it appear as a valid certificate while it is actually malicious.
*   **Missing CN Matching:** The server did not enforce a match between the certificate name (certname) it was intending to sign and the CN value in the CSR.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** By crafting malicious CSRs, an attacker could trick an administrator into signing a certificate for an attacker-controlled system. The attacker could then use this signed certificate to impersonate a legitimate agent node, enabling a man-in-the-middle attack on other nodes.
*   **Loss of Trust:**  Compromised agent certificates would undermine the trust relationship within the Puppet infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious CSR Creation:** An attacker could create a CSR with a manipulated CN field and submit it to the Puppet master for signing.
*   **Exploiting Admin Oversight:**  The success of the attack relied on an administrator unknowingly approving a maliciously crafted certificate request, potentially due to the misleading name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Puppet Infrastructure:** The attacker needs to have the capability to submit certificate signing requests to the Puppet master.
*   **Knowledge of Puppet mechanisms:** A good understanding of how Puppet handles certificates and signing was needed to craft a successful attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Puppet versions 2.6.16 and 2.7.17 and fixed in 2.6.17 and 2.7.18.
*   The fix involved adding stricter validation to the CN field, including limiting the allowed characters and enforcing a match between the expected certificate name and the CN in the CSR.
*   The fix also involved rejecting CSRs with wildcard characters in the CN.
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2012-3864, CVE-2012-3865, and CVE-2012-3866.
*   Affected products include openSUSE 12.1, openSUSE 11.4, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 for VMware, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP2, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP1, Debian and Ubuntu.
