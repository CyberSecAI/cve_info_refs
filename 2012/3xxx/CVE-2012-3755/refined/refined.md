- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow existed in the handling of Targa image files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: Viewing a maliciously crafted Targa file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Viewing a specially crafted Targa file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious Targa file to the user (e.g., via email or website).
