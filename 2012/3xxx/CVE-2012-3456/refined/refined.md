Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-3456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the MS Word ODF filter within Calligra and KOffice. This occurs when processing specially crafted MS Word documents, due to insufficient input validation. The vulnerability is located within an embedded copy of the `wv2` library used for parsing MS Word documents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow. This occurs when the software writes data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations, leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Input Validation Failure:** The vulnerability arises from an input validation failure during the parsing of the MS Word documents. The software does not adequately check the structure or size of the data being read, leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft a malicious MS Word document that, when opened by a user using vulnerable software, can cause the application to crash.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** More seriously, successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system, with the privileges of the user who opened the malicious file. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File-based Attack:** The attack vector is primarily through a specially crafted MS Word document. An attacker would need to trick a user into opening a malicious document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting Malicious Document:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious MS Word document that triggers the buffer overflow during parsing in the vulnerable software.
*   **Social Engineering/Trickery:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening the malicious document, as the vulnerability is triggered when a user processes the malicious document.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Charlie Miller, and details of the exploit were made public at Black Hat 2012 (page 39 of the presentation).
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Calligra before 2.5 and all released versions of KOffice.
*   Patches have been committed to the Calligra Git repository, including the 2.4, 2.5, and master branches. A patch has also been committed to the master branch of the KOffice Git repository.
*   The vulnerability is present in the embedded `wv2` library.
