1.  **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - Integer overflows in the `_objalloc_alloc` function (objalloc.c) and the `objalloc_alloc` macro (include/objalloc.h) within the GNU libiberty library.

2.  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The `_objalloc_alloc` function does not properly validate the addition of `CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE` to the length, leading to a potential overflow when allocating space.
    - The pointer alignment arithmetic in the `objalloc_alloc` macro lacks an overflow check, leading to allocation of memory regions smaller than expected.
    - The `objalloc_alloc` function, when used for allocation can return a pointer to memory that's smaller than requested due to lack of proper overflow checks, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

3.  **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of service (crash) of affected applications.
    - Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the affected binary.

4.  **Attack vectors:**
    - Remote attackers can provide a crafted binary file with a specially crafted header that when processed by affected programs can trigger the integer overflows in libiberty causing a crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

5.  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to provide a crafted binary file to a vulnerable program (e.g., `nm`, `objcopy`, `objdump`, `gdb`).
    - No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability besides the ability to provide an input file processed by vulnerable tools.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability exists in libiberty, a library used by various GNU programs, including binutils and gdb.
- The gdb package is affected but impact is limited to crash only.
- The fix involves adding overflow checks to the `_objalloc_alloc` function and not using fast path in the `objalloc_alloc` macro.
- The issue affects various Linux distributions including Red Hat, Debian and Ubuntu.
- Several packages were identified as bundling libiberty.
- Upstream patch is available and has been integrated into various distributions.
