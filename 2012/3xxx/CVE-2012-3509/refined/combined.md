A remote attacker could provide a binary file which specially-crafted header that, when processed by some of the bfd binaries (nm, objcopy, objdump etc.) would lead to that bfd executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the bfd binary.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=849693#c2)  Jan Kratochvil    2012-08-20 15:46:59 UTC  ``` Is there a remote code execution possibility?

For mingw-binutils, mingw-gcc and mingw-gdb I think these are correct (as their native counterparts also use libiberty). However for mingw-headers, mingw-crt and mingw-w64-tools I think these are false positives.

The following packages actually export the _objalloc_alloc symbol (this is incomplete as my tool doesn't have Fedora 17 imported, so this is from Fedora 16):  binutils-2.21.53.0.1-6.fc16 (binutils): _objalloc_alloc in /usr/lib/libbfd-2.21.53.0.1-6.fc16.so crash-6.0.2-1.fc16 (crash): _objalloc_alloc in /usr/bin/crash gdb-7.3.50.20110722-10.fc16 (gdb): _objalloc_alloc in /usr/bin/gdb insight-6.8.1-4.fc15 (insight): _objalloc_alloc in /usr/bin/insight lush-1.2.1-6.fc12 (lush): _objalloc_alloc in /usr/bin/lush mono-debugger-2.10-1.fc16 (mono-debugger): _objalloc_alloc in /usr/lib/libmonodebuggerserver.so.0.0.0 mutrace-0.2-2.fc15 (mutrace): _objalloc_alloc in /usr/lib/libmutrace-backtrace-symbols.so  Based on prior discussion, it does not seem that gcc is affected by this, and the above backs it up unless gcc is hiding the symbols (or my tool is wrong).  It looks as though lush isn't in Fedora 17 so could be ignored, but the immediate suspects are gdb, binutils, crash, insight, mono-debugger, and mutrace.  I don't know about, for instance, avr-gdb as it doesn't seem to export the symbol, but I also don't know if that really means anything (not sure what avr binaries are or what "remote debugging is", based on the rpm description).  If nothing else, this is a list to work off of, at least initially.  I'm hesitant to file tracking bugs for these, however, because a tracking bug was filed for gdb a month ago for Fedora, and nothing has been done with it that I can see.  Is there a problem with the patch, or some other reason for not getting the fix into gdb?   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=849693#c30)  Jan Kratochvil    2012-11-15 19:49:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #29](show_bug.cgi?id=849693#c29)) > The following packages actually export the _objalloc_alloc symbol  This is incomplete as _objalloc_alloc does not have to be exported but it still can be used inside the binary.  Package 'gdb' exports its very every symbol but this is a current bug to be fixed.  It is caused due to its linkage with Python:   -Xlinker -export-dynamic  avr-gdb does not link with Python so it does not wasterfully export everything. Therefore to very avr-gdb one has to verify _objalloc_alloc presence by:  # yum install avr-gdb-debuginfo $ nm /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/avr-gdb.debug | grep -w _objalloc_alloc 00000000005d85c0 T _objalloc_alloc  So avr-gdb and probably some other packages should be also listed as affected.   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=849693#c31)  Jan Kratochvil    2012-11-16 08:16:32 UTC  ``` Jan, is this bug therefore an "arbitrary code execution" exploitable or not?

Depends on the way how you are asking: -------------------------------------- 1) If you are asking generally if [CVE-2012-3509](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3509) flaw can be used for arbitrary code execution (an adversary to reach code execution under the privileges of the victim, when the victim inspects provided file remotely), then the reply would be yes. The [CVE-2012-3509](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3509) flaw is believed to be able to cause arbitrary code execution. To actually reach this it would not be a trivial task though.  2) If you are asking if gdb packages (since embedding libiberty code) are prone to arbitrary code execution, then the reply would be no. The actual exploitation depends on the 'code around' processing result of bfd_alloc2() / _objalloc_alloc and from what I can tell so far for gdb case, the resulting buffer is under-allocated, but the subsequent routine is just zero-ying its content at:    #2  setup_group (newsect=0x29a9bf0, hdr=0x29b2690, abfd=0x297a960) at ../../bfd/elf.c:607  routine, so explicitly for gdb this could not allow arbitrary code execution.  >  > IMO it is not, therefore it is a normal uninteresting crasher bug which has > been fixed upstream now and which is IMO not even worth a backport.  There > are many such uninteresting invalid-input crasher bugs in GNU toolchain (see > [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=849693#c2)).  See above. If we are talking about gdb case here, then yes, I agree. But for the rest of possibly affected packages the potential impact still needs to be investigated (to either confirm the danger or disprove it like in gdb case).   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=849693#c34)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-11-16 10:42:15 UTC  ```  Statement:  The versions of the gdb package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 are vulnerable to the original libiberty integer overflow flaw. But due the way of subsequent processing of the previously insufficiently pre-allocated libiberty buffer within gdb code, the impact of this issue is limited to crash only. Red Hat Security Response Team does not consider crash of end-user application, such as gdb, to be a security flaw.   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=849693#c35)  Fedora Update System    2012-11-23 07:25:36 UTC  ``` insight-7.4.50-4.20120403cvs.fc18 has been pushed to the Fedora 18 stable repository.

Message-ID: <87zk5dy3dl.fsf@mid.deneb.enyo.de>
Date: Wed, 29 Aug 2012 20:11:50 +0200
From: Florian Weimer <fw@...eb.enyo.de>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE-2012-3509: objalloc_alloc integer overflows in libiberty

Sang Kil Cha discovered that _objalloc_alloc does not guard the
addition of CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE to the length against overflow.  This
can cause _objalloc_alloc to return a pointer to a memory region which
is smaller than expected.

The pointer alignment arithmetic in the objalloc_alloc macro misses an
overflow check as well, with similar consequences.

GCC bug:

<http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_activity.cgi?id=54411>

Patch under review:

<http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2012-08/msg01986.html>

(I believe GCC has the master copy of this file, but does not use it
itself.  libiberty is part of binutils and GDB, too.)

Multiple integer overflows in the (1) \_objalloc\_alloc function in
objalloc.c and (2) objalloc\_alloc macro in include/objalloc.h in GNU
libiberty, as used by binutils 2.22, allow remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash) via vectors related to the "addition of
CHUNK\_HEADER\_SIZE to the length," which triggers a heap-based buffer
overflow.

# USN-2496-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

9 February 2015

Applications from GNU binutils could be made to crash, run programs,
or delete arbitrary files as your login if they opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Details

Michal Zalewski discovered that the setup\_group function in libbfd in

GNU binutils did not properly check group headers in ELF files. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8485](/security/CVE-2014-8485))

Hanno Böck discovered that the \_bfd\_XXi\_swap\_aouthdr\_in function

in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds writes. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8501](/security/CVE-2014-8501))

Hanno Böck discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the

pe\_print\_edata function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker

could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8502](/security/CVE-2014-8502))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered multiple directory traversal

vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft

input that could delete arbitrary files. ([CVE-2014-8737](/security/CVE-2014-8737))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered the \_bfd\_slurp\_extended\_name\_table

function in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed invalid writes when handling

extended name tables in an archive. An attacker could use this to

craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8738](/security/CVE-2014-8738))

Hanno Böck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex\_scan

function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this

to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash). ([CVE-2014-8503](/security/CVE-2014-8503))

Michal Zalewski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the

srec\_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could

use this to to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash); the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf

protection should prevent the possibility of executing arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8504](/security/CVE-2014-8504))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the srec\_scan function in libbfd

in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could

use this to craft input to cause a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 10.04

LTS. ([CVE-2014-8484](/security/CVE-2014-8484))

Sang Kil Cha discovered multiple integer overflows in the

\_objalloc\_alloc function and objalloc\_alloc macro in binutils. This

could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (application

crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2012-3509](/security/CVE-2012-3509))

Alexander Cherepanov and Hanno Böck discovered multiple additional

out-of-bounds reads and writes in GNU binutils. An attacker could use

these to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. A few of these issues may

be limited in exposure to a denial of service (application abort)

by the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf protection.

The strings(1) utility in GNU binutils used libbfd by default when

examining executable object files; unfortunately, libbfd was not

originally developed with the expectation of hostile input. As

a defensive measure, the behavior of strings has been changed to

default to 'strings --all' behavior, which does not use libbfd; use

the new argument to strings, '--data', to recreate the old behavior.

# CVE-2012-3509

| **Name** | CVE-2012-3509 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Multiple integer overflows in the (1) \_objalloc\_alloc function in objalloc.c and (2) objalloc\_alloc macro in include/objalloc.h in GNU libiberty, as used by binutils 2.22, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors related to the "addition of CHUNK\_HEADER\_SIZE to the length," which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. |

| [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=776968#c4)  Marcus Meissner   2012-08-30 12:32:06 UTC  ``` Sang Kil Cha discovered that _objalloc_alloc does not guard the addition of CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE to the length against overflow.  This can cause _objalloc_alloc to return a pointer to a memory region which is smaller than expected.  The pointer alignment arithmetic in the objalloc_alloc macro misses an overflow check as well, with similar consequences.  GCC bug:  <http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_activity.cgi?id=54411>  Patch under review:  <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2012-08/msg01986.html>  (I believe GCC has the master copy of this file, but does not use it itself.  libiberty is part of binutils and GDB, too.) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=776968#c5)  Marcus Meissner   2012-09-05 08:25:18 UTC  ``` Talked with richi ...   we both could not think about exploitability ... if you can supply executables to stuff then you likely already have rights to execute them.  So a minor issue.  It will be fixed in future products. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=776968#c6)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2012-09-10 14:00:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (776968) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/133496> Factory / binutils ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=776968#c7)  Richard Biener   2013-02-12 14:46:14 UTC  ``` Fixed. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=776968#c8)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-10-22 12:10:17 UTC  ``` SUSE-OU-2015:1803-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has 6 fixes is now available.

Code processed by binutils is being executed in any normal scenario, so security exploits could just inject regular binary code. For this reason we update binutils only around once a year to the current stable version to catch up on features and bugfixes. If you are processing untrusted binary code with binutils we recommend doing so on a seperate system or VM.SUSE Bugzilla entry: [776968](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=776968) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=54411#c0)  Florian Weimer    2012-08-29 17:11:11 UTC  ``` Sang Kil Cha discovered that _objalloc_alloc does not guard the addition of CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE to the length against overflow.  This can cause _objalloc_alloc to return a pointer to a memory region which is smaller than expected.  The pointer alignment arithmetic in the objalloc_alloc macro misses an overflow check as well, with similar consequences. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=54411#c1)  Florian Weimer    2012-08-29 17:12:02 UTC  ``` I'll come up with a patch for both issues (I don't think there is one yet). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=54411#c2)  jsm-csl@polyomino.org.uk    2012-08-29 19:09:55 UTC  ``` You do realise that pretty much nothing in the toolchain checks for  overflows in calculating allocation sizes?  If you want to fix such  issues more systematically, the macros in libiberty.h such as XNEWVEC  would be a good starting point in which to insert overflow checks, but  there will be loads of other places affected as well. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=54411#c3)  Florian Weimer    2012-08-29 19:18:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=54411#c2)) > You do realise that pretty much nothing in the toolchain checks for  > overflows in calculating allocation sizes?  bfd_alloc2 (bfd's XNEWVEC variant) contains an overflow check, and this bug defeats it.  Your point about XNEWVEC is appreciated, but this is a different bug. 8-) ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=54411#c4)  jsm-csl@polyomino.org.uk    2012-08-29 21:29:12 UTC  ``` On Wed, 29 Aug 2012, fw at gcc dot gnu.org wrote:  > > You do realise that pretty much nothing in the toolchain checks for  > > overflows in calculating allocation sizes? >  > bfd_alloc2 (bfd's XNEWVEC variant) contains an overflow check, and this bug > defeats it. >  > Your point about XNEWVEC is appreciated, but this is a different bug. 8-)  My point is that there are probably hundreds of such bugs in the toolchain  sources (and lots more bugs where BFD and GDB fail to handle invalid  input); XNEWVEC is just an example of one that's comparatively easy to  find and fix (but I'm sure plenty more are easy to find for anyone going  looking for them). ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=54411#c5)  Florian Weimer    2012-09-18 08:34:12 UTC  ``` Author: fw Date: Tue Sep 18 08:34:05 2012 New Revision: 191413  URL: <http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?root=gcc&view=rev&rev=191413> Log: [PR other/54411](show_bug.cgi?id=54411 "RESOLVED FIXED - libiberty: objalloc_alloc integer overflows (CVE-2012-3509)"): integer overflow in objalloc_alloc  2012-09-18  Florian Weimer  <fweimer@redhat.com>  	[PR other/54411](show_bug.cgi?id=54411 "RESOLVED FIXED - libiberty: objalloc_alloc integer overflows (CVE-2012-3509)") 	* objalloc.h (objalloc_alloc): Do not use fast path on wraparound.  2012-09-18  Florian Weimer  <fweimer@redhat.com>  	[PR other/54411](show_bug.cgi?id=54411 "RESOLVED FIXED - libiberty: objalloc_alloc integer overflows (CVE-2012-3509)") 	* objalloc.c (_objalloc_alloc): Add overflow check covering 	alignment and CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE addition.

# [PATCH] PR other/54411: libiberty: objalloc\_alloc integer overflows (CVE-2012-3509)

* *From*: Florian Weimer <fw at deneb dot enyo dot de>
* *To*: gcc-patches at gcc dot gnu dot org
* *Date*: Wed, 29 Aug 2012 19:32:51 +0200
* *Subject*: [PATCH] PR other/54411: libiberty: objalloc\_alloc integer overflows (CVE-2012-3509)

---

```
This patches fixes an integer overflow in libiberty, which leads to
crashes in binutils.  The long version of the objalloc_alloc macro
would have needed another conditional, so I removed that and replaced
it with a call to the actual implementation.

This has been compiled-tested only.  We do not use this function in
GCC, therefore I want to commit this just to the trunk.

2012-08-29  Florian Weimer  <fw@deneb.enyo.de>

	PR other/54411
	* objalloc.h (objalloc_alloc): Always use the simple definition of
	the macro.

2012-08-29  Florian Weimer  <fw@deneb.enyo.de>

	PR other/54411
	* objalloc.c (_objalloc_alloc): Add overflow check covering
	alignment and CHUNK_HEADER_SIZE addition.
