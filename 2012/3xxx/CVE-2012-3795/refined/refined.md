Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3795:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2012-3795 in the ICS-CERT advisory and describes it as "Invalid Memory Read Access." This aligns with the CVE description which is about a memory read access issue.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper bounds checking when handling a size value in a network packet. This allows an attacker to specify a large size value, causing the server to attempt to read memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Invalid memory read access, which can lead to information disclosure.
- Lack of input validation of the size parameter.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to server crash
- Disclosure of memory contents. The server copies memory back to the client, potentially revealing sensitive information in the process.

**5. Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack through specially crafted network packets sent to the vulnerable service.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service (Pro-Server EX).
- No authentication is required, as the vulnerability is exploitable even when the server is protected by a password.

**Details:**
The vulnerability exists in the `osUTmemcpy` function. An attacker can control the size parameter of the data to be copied which allows them to read beyond allocated memory. Specifically, the opcode `0x07 -> 0x5/0x6/0x7/0x14` can trigger this condition.  The server reads data from memory locations specified in the network packet and returns a desired amount of memory back to the client. This means the attacker can read memory until the end of the buffer.

The vulnerability is present in Pro-Server EX versions 1.00.00 through 1.30.00, and HMI screen editor and logic programming software GP-Pro EX and related software WinGP Versions 2.00.00 through 3.01.100.

The ICS-CERT advisory also notes that public exploits for this vulnerability are available.
