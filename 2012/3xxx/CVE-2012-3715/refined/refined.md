- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic issue existed in the handling of HTTPS URLs in the address bar. Specifically, if a portion of the address was edited by pasting text, the request might be unexpectedly sent over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect handling of HTTPS URLs after editing via pasting in the address bar.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A request that should have been sent over HTTPS might be sent over HTTP, potentially exposing sensitive data to network eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into editing an HTTPS URL in the address bar by pasting text, leading to the potential downgrade to an unencrypted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the user's actions, potentially via a social engineering tactic to get the user to paste text into the URL bar of a secure website.
