  Introduction

Introduction

This 8.6(2a)SU2 ReadMe file contains important information about installation procedures and resolved
caveats for Cisco Unified Communications Manager release 8.6(2a)SU2. This SU can be applied to Cisco
Unified Communications Manager, Business Edition 5000 or 6000 and Cisco Unity Connection. It should not
be installed on a Business Edition 3000 server.

System Requirements

The following sections comprise the system requirements for this release.

Server Support
Make sure that you install and configure this SU on a Cisco Media Convergence Server (MCS) or a
Cisco-approved HP server configuration or a Cisco-approved IBM server configuration.

To find which servers support Cisco Unified CM Release 8.6(x), refer to the Cisco Unified
Communications Manager Server Support Matrix at

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/voicesw/ps6790/ps5748/ps378/prod_brochure0900aecd80
62a4f9.html

Note Make sure that the matrix shows that your server model supports Cisco Unified CM Release 8.6(x).

Uninterruptible Power Supply
Ensure that you connect each Unified CM node to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to provide
backup power and protect your system.

Caution

Failure to connect the Cisco Unified Communication Manager nodes to a UPS may result in damage to
physical media and require a new installation of Cisco Unified CM.

Version and Description

This SU is a cumulative update that incorporates all of the fixes and changes from Cisco Unified
Communications Manager 8.6(2), 8.6(2a), and 8.6(2a)SU1, along with additional changes that are
specific to this SU.

Note

You can only install this SU on Cisco Unified Communications Manager Release 6.1(4x), 6.1(5x),
7.1(3x), 7.1(5x), 8.0(1x), 8.0(2x), 8.0(3x), 8.5(1x), 8.6(1x), 8.6(2), 8.6(2a), 8.6(2a)SU1 or any 8.6(2)es
from 8.6.2.21001-1 to 8.6.2.22033-1. Upgrades from 6x and 7x need to be requested via PUT
(www.cisco.com/upgrade) to obtain the necessary license. This SU should not be installed on a Business
Edition 3000 server.

See the Compatibility Matrix for further details:

  Important Notes

Important Notes

SUs do not impact system compatibility unless specifically stated.

Cisco provides the following guidance to help you successfully upgrade Cisco Unified Communications
Manager software:

  • To minimize call-processing interruptions during the upgrade process, register all devices to servers
that are running the same version of Cisco Unified Communications Manager software. Make sure
that you register all devices to the backup Cisco Unified Communications Manager server or to the
primary Cisco Unified Communications Manager server, but not to both the backup and primary
servers.

Warning for CSCtj50884

  • This SU contains an update to the RTMT client that addresses a significant memory leak. You must
upgrade the client version on any device that uses the RTMT client to completely resolve this issue.
Please see the Bug Details of fix CSCtj50884 for complete instructions on resolving this issue.

Firmware Upgrade Issues

For all SCCP and SIP firmware upgrades from firmware release versions earlier than 8.3(3) to version
8.5(2)SR1 or greater, you must first upgrade your firmware to version 8.5(2). Once you have upgraded
to version 8.5(2), you can upgrade your IP Phone to version 8.5(2)SR1 or later. Refer to the Firmware
Versions in this Release section of this document to determine the firmware load provided in this SU.

For additional details, Firmware Upgrade Instructions, and Firmware Download locations please see:

Installation Instructions

Note

Apply this SU to all of your Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers, beginning with the
publisher server and TFTP server.

Refer to the “Upgrading to Unified CM 8.6(2a)” section of the Release Notes for Cisco Unified Com-
munications Manager Release 8.6(2a) for detailed information about doing this upgrade:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/rel_notes/8_6_2/cucm-rel_notes-862a.html#
wp1944944

Note

Because the 8.6.2.22900-9 build is a non-bootable ISO, it proves useful only for upgrades. You cannot use it
for new installations.

Release 8.6(2) is available in both restricted (which is the release type that has always been available from
Cisco) and unrestricted versions of software to comply with import / export restrictions to various coun-
tries. The unrestricted version is available in limited markets. Please refer to the 8.6(2) Release Notes refer-
enced above for a more detailed description.

Caution

For both restricted and unrestricted upgrades from an 8.5(x) or earlier release to an 8.6(x) release, a patch
(COP file) must be applied prior to initiating the upgrade. Before you upgrade from compatible versions
of Unified CM, install the COP file named ciscocm.refresh_upgrade_v1.1.cop.sgn. Please refer to the
Installing the COP File section of the Release Notes for Cisco Unified Communications Manager
Release 8.6(2a) referenced earlier in this document for detailed installation instructions and download
location.

The file names and MD5 values you will use for this upgrade are:

  • UCSInstall_UCOS_8.6.2.22900-9.sgn.iso

The MD5 for the Restricted combined download is: eb4aa145026357a04e4269956138ed0d

Note

Once installed, UNRST releases can never be converted or upgraded to releases which support full
encryption capabilities

For the Unrestricted version:

  • UCSInstall_UCOS_UNRST_8.6.2.22900-9.sgn.iso

The MD5 for the Unrestricted combined download is: 7433345a5cef3c90fd971d360315bfa4
