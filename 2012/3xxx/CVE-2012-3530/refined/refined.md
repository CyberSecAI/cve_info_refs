Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3530:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the failure of the `t3lib_div::RemoveXSS()` API method in TYPO3 to remove certain HTML5 JavaScript events. Additionally, the `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue()` method does not properly encode for Javascript. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `t3lib_div::RemoveXSS()` method uses a blacklist approach and fails to remove all potentially dangerous HTML5 JavaScript events, thus not filtering specially crafted HTML injections.
*   **Improper Output Encoding:** The `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue()` method fails to properly encode output for JavaScript context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users. This allows for various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of websites
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Data theft

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through specially crafted HTML injections that exploit the insufficient sanitization in the `t3lib_div::RemoveXSS()` method. 
*   Additionally, the improper Javascript encoding of `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue()` can be exploited via JavaScript injections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No specific access needed:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N)
*   **HTML crafting knowledge:** Attackers need the ability to create malicious HTML/JavaScript code that can bypass sanitization and encoding mechanisms.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is rated as Medium severity.
*   The official advisory notes that developers should not rely solely on the `RemoveXSS()` blacklist, and should always encode user input before output.
