Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2012-3983:

**CVE-2012-3983:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a memory safety issue within the JavaScript engine of Firefox. Specifically, it involves a crash related to the use of `newGlobal`, `newContext` and the `--dump-bytecode` options when evaluating javascript code within different contexts. The root cause is that when a new Javascript context is created, code from a non-pccount script can be inlined into a pccount script, leading to a crash.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Memory corruption due to incorrect handling of JavaScript contexts.
    *   The issue is triggered during the execution of JIT-compiled (mjit) code.
    *   The vulnerability occurs when the function `g()` is executed.
    *   Improper handling of JSOPTION\_PCCOUNT during function compilation and execution.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Crash of the browser.
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption can be controlled to a greater extent.
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious website, especially with JavaScript enabled.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered through JavaScript code execution when a user visits a malicious page.
    *   The `--dump-bytecode` option is part of the Javascript shell, and whilst not intended for web-based attacks, can be used to replicate the conditions for a crash in testing.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to serve or inject malicious JavaScript into a webpage.
    *   The user must be using a vulnerable version of Firefox.
    *   The user must enable javascript for the malicious page.

**Additional Details from the Bug Reports:**

*   The bug was introduced by changes related to adding options to the JavaScript shell's `evaluate()` function, specifically the `newContext` option.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a function is evaluated in a new context and then called repeatedly, particularly with `JSOPTION_PCCOUNT` set in the calling context but not necessarily during compilation of the new context.
*   The fix involved ensuring that the correct compartment is entered when allocating types in `ReserveForTradeGuts` to ensure the appropriate memory area is used for the new Javascript context.
*   The vulnerability was considered security critical and was addressed by a patch in Firefox 16. The issue also affected Firefox versions 13, 14 and 15, as well as ESR 10 but were not fixed due to limited impact.

The provided content also lists other CVEs fixed in the same update, indicating a wider range of security issues were addressed simultaneously.
