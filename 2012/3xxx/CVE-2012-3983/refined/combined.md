How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Many kudos to Jesse for reducing to this super testcase after I found it and sent a half-reduced one over to him.

This doesn't have a security rating, but has been requested for tracking. Does that imply this is an sg:crit?

This seems likely, but we are not sure and would like double confirmation from the JS devs.

[Bug 755808](/show_bug.cgi?id=755808 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add more options to shell evaluate() function") only changed js.cpp (the shell), so unless this turns out to be a shell-only bug, we can't assume this bug was introduced when [bug 755808](/show_bug.cgi?id=755808 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add more options to shell evaluate() function") landed.

Right. I can't tell yet.
That patch added the "evaluate(code, {newContext: true})" option, which didn't exist before. But evaluating code in a new JSContext \*is\* something that might be possible in the browser -- which is why I added the ability to run such tests in the shell.

OK, a bit simpler:
function f() { }
evaluate('function g() { f(); }', {newContext: true});
for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++)
g(0);
I think it happens because JSOPTION\_PCCOUNT is set when the function g is executed but not when it is compiled.

It happens because jaeger inlines the non-pccount script into the pccount script. Easy fix.

Jason, does this affect earlier versions of Firefox? (14 & earlier, including ESR 10)
Also, I think the patch will need to be nominated for aurora landing if it affects 15.

sfink thinks the only things using pccount are a couple of experimental tools. That's unlikely to change in 15 or earlier.
Based on that, we think it's not necessary to patch this on aurora or earlier branches.

When there is no frame, the result of IsCapabilityEnabled is always true. This is not good since event listeners can be called with no frame.

[testcase - arbitrary code execution](attachment.cgi?id=631400)

This uses [bug 344495](/show_bug.cgi?id=344495 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS against certain sites that are using scripts that access properties of top, parent or opener")'s trick.
This works on trunk.

That used moz\_bug\_r\_a4's stack frame trick? I wasn't sure those were ever checked in.

We don't want to check in tests demonstrating the exploit, but often the specific problem can be demonstrated without using that trick (sometimes requires a chrome testcase to show the wrong thing is getting used/returned in places).Blocks: [754202](/show_bug.cgi?id=754202 "RESOLVED FIXED - Pull principals directly off the context/object compartment")Keywords: [regression](/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&resolution=---),

This should be fixed by the backout in [bug 754202 comment 41](/show_bug.cgi?id=754202#c41 "RESOLVED FIXED - Pull principals directly off the context/object compartment") right?

I can't get this testcase to do anything on pre-fix trunk builds. The only thing I see that is different pre and post fix on my mozilla central builds is that pre-fix has the following in the webconsole:
[12:02:01.330] Error: Permission denied for <<https://bug762920.bugzilla.mozilla.org>> to get property XPCComponents.utils
I see the same whether I load it locally or from bugzilla, as in above. Do we have something that repros that issue?

There should be a specific window, between when [bug 754202](/show_bug.cgi?id=754202 "RESOLVED FIXED - Pull principals directly off the context/object compartment") landed and when it was backed out, where you should get an alert popup (indicating that the exploit was successful).

All right. I was a day off last time. Bug repro's in 6/9 Mozilla Central build and was fixed after back out off [bug 754202](/show_bug.cgi?id=754202 "RESOLVED FIXED - Pull principals directly off the context/object compartment").Status: RESOLVED → VERIFIED

Attached patch

[patch](attachment.cgi?id=661041&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=661041&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=790865&attachment=661041)

Nice find, Jesse! We get in trouble here while doing some wrapper rejiggering and we call JSObject::swap. At this point, the value of cx->compartment is not expected to be anything in particular. Then we call ReserveForTradeGuts without entering any compartment. It potentially allocates shapes and types, which go in cx->compartment, and that is likely to be the wrong compartment.
I'm pretty surprised that this bug has lasted as long as it has. It seems to have been introduced with the ObjShrink work (FF11), which was when we tied an object's shape to the number of slots it has. That's what forces us to make new shapes.
The fix is to add an AutoEnterCompartment in ReserveForTradeGuts. The remainder of the patch adds a lot of compartment assertions. Perhaps most significantly, it adds a much more precise compartment checker that runs at the beginning of every GC. It iterates over every GC thing in the heap, looking for pointers outside the current compartment. With only this checker enabled, and without the AutoEnterCompartment, I get an assertion just doing a little browsing around. Very embarrasing.
Hopefully this fix will cause a noticeable downward effect on our crash volume.Assignee: general → wmccloskeyStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

This is filled with win. Would it be possible and worth it to systematically add assertions for cx->compartment == thing->compartment at all JS\_ entry points that take gcthing pointers?

Can we add a reliable testcase for this to the testsuite? Maybe when [bug 829349](/show_bug.cgi?id=829349 "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE - Add more assertSameCompartment to places where the browser calls into the JS engine") is through?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110209 Firefox/4.0b12pre ID:20110209030359
We run into a huge memory leak which can also freeze the system, just by performing the following steps:
1. Create a fresh profile and stick the attached users.js file into it
2. Install the latest alpha version of Firebug 1.7 (<http://getfirebug.com/releases/firebug/1.7X/firebug-1.7X.0a10.xpi>)
3. Open the given URL
Within seconds the memory will be filled-up completely and the system can freeze.
This is a regression and happened between Beta 7 and Beta 8. I will nail down the regression range tomorrow morning.

what advanced js settings are set?
user\_pref("javascript.options.strict", true);
user\_pref("pref.advanced.javascript.disable\_button.advanced", false);
why are you using strict? This is a known problem, believe we have bugs on it
already.Whiteboard: [mlk] → [mlk][dupeme]

If you use the strict option, you will get lots of warnings to the error console on pretty much any site.
If Firebug saves all error console output, you will get a "leak".

It only happens with all those three prefs set. Removing only one will not cause this leak. Even with GreaseMonkey not installed, I don't see how that pref has an influence here.

What does "that pref" mean in the last sentence?

Before that patch, in certain places we would parse JS files by reading them
and parsing them one chunk at a time, where a chunk was a few KB. After
that patch, we instead read the whole file into memory before parsing. This
made scanning much simpler and faster at the cost of higher (transient)
memory use.
Compiler::compileScript() was the top-level function whose API changed.
It's called by the following functions:
- JS\_CompileFile (affected)
- JS\_CompileFileHandleForPrincipals (affected), which is called by:
- JS\_CompileFileHandleForPrincipalsVersion (affected)
- JS\_CompileFileHandle (affected)
- JS\_CompileUCScriptForPrincipals (unaffected)
- EvalKernel (unaffected)
Of the affected functions, only JS\_CompileFileHandleForPrincipalsVersion()
is used in the browser, AFAICT, and only then if HAVE\_PR\_MEMMAP isn't
defined.
So I can't see off the top of my head what could be going wrong, but I've
written this down to (a) refresh the details in my own head, and (b) in case
it sparks an idea in someone else.
I'll now try to reproduce.

I can reproduce on Linux64, more or less. Viewing that page without Firebug installed, process size topped out at ~800MB. With Firebug, it topped out at ~3100MB, with ~2300 resident. about:memory claimed only 256MB mapped, so it's not a heap problem. The browser was responsive the whole time, maybe because I have 4GB of RAM.
But in the time it's taken me to write this comment, process size has dropped to 869MB. So it looks like a big transient spike. Time to pull out Massif.

Oh, wait, I tried again. The big drop didn't occur until after I opened about:memory. And this time about:memory said "memory mapped" was 2.0GB and "memory in use" was 1.9GB, but none of the individual counts below that were out of the ordinary. So it \*is\* heap memory that's the problem.

I can reproduce with only this option set:
user\_pref("javascript.options.strict", true);
So I suspect this is a dup of [bug 620218](/show_bug.cgi?id=620218 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Loading a web page hangs browser (>1GB of additional memory usage) when javascript.options.strict enabled and any console service is attached"). I don't know why [bug 588648](/show_bug.cgi?id=588648 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't copy chars when scanning") would be the regression suspect, I'll double-check if it really is the regression.
(As [bug 620818](/show_bug.cgi?id=620818 "VERIFIED INVALID - Remove the AppID name in the app launcher") says, setting that option is just asking for trouble, it's not clear to me why it exists.)

Thanks for checking on this. From what I gather, that pref is considered harmful, and [bug 620218](/show_bug.cgi?id=620218 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Loading a web page hangs browser (>1GB of additional memory usage) when javascript.options.strict enabled and any console service is attached") doesn't block, so neither should this bug.blocking2.0: final+ → -Whiteboard: [mlk][dupeme][hardblocker] → [mlk][dupeme]

Oh, I know what's happened. [Bug 588648](/show_bug.cgi?id=588648 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't copy chars when scanning") also changed error reporting a bit. Previously, because we were dealing with chunks, there was a limit to how much of a line an error message could include. But now the error message contains the entire line. If you have very long lines and lots of errors, it's a recipe for high memory usage, especially since we call js\_DeflateString() on the error message string, resulting in two copies of it (one made of jschars, the other made of chars).
On the site in question, heaps of errors occurred on a line containing 122,895 chars, resulting in over 1G of chars (at 3 bytes per char!) being put into error messages.
As for why it only occurs when Firebug is installed... without Firebug, I think we do lots of big allocations but then free each one as soon as the error has been reported. So there's lots of malloc churn, but no big spike. With Firebug, the error reports are evidently held onto somehow. Furthermore, if I disable Firebug but open the error console the spike also occurs.
It should be a pretty easy fix; I just need to truncate the line if it's larger than a certain size. I think it's reasonable to keep this as a hardblocker.

The question is whether we can get thousands of error messages in other situations. I don't have a good sense of how likely that is, and thus whether this should block.

Just to clarify, the cause of this bug the interaction of the following things:
(1) [Bug 588648](/show_bug.cgi?id=588648 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't copy chars when scanning") allowed error messages to contain entire lines (which can be very wrong).
(2) The presence of javascript.options.strict can lead to thousands of error messages.
(3) The presence of a console (be it the error console or Firebug) causes those error messages to be held onto.
(3) is controlled by the user. (2) is a bad option, but large numbers of errors may occur due to other reasons. (1) is stupid and can be fixed easily.

You could have some sort of minified JS (so it's all on one line; I'll bet that's what happens with the site in question) that has a bug in a setInterval it sets. Then you'll get an error every 10ms or worse if there are multiple copies of the interval.

Attached patch

[patch (against TM 62203:d7a8d64336ba)](attachment.cgi?id=513032&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=513032&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=634444&attachment=513032)

This patch adjusts the syntax error reporting to truncate long lines --
it'll show at most 2\*WINDOW+1 chars of a line in an error message, where
WINDOW=100. 100 seems reasonable but I'm open to changing it.
The patch also fixes another defect that [bug 588648](/show_bug.cgi?id=588648 "RESOLVED FIXED - Don't copy chars when scanning") introduced, whereby
tp->begin.index could be set to -1, which became 4294967295 because it's
unsigned. I found this because the new line truncation code uses
begin.index and when it was 4294967295 all hell broke loose. This required
fiddling with the |adjust| parameter to getChar() for a couple of cases. I
added an assertion in newToken() to prevent this defect from arising again.
I've confirmed that the big memory spike seen in the browser no longer
happens when javascript.options.strict is true and a console is present.

patch (against TM 62203:d7a8d64336ba)
Looks good, nits only. The "sline" name looks like "slime" but maybe that is fitting ;-).
>-TokenStream::findEOL()
>+TokenStream::findEOLorTrunc(jschar \*tokptr, int max)
This isn't quite camelCaps but I see why "or" is all-lowercase. Still kind of overlong and unsightly. Just "findEOL" seems fine to me, better than trying to say more yet still chopping "ate" off.

Could use "wline" or "window" instead of "sline" -- would fit the WINDOW name better.
Digging the non-camelCaps localnames. Don't change (but see below).

This needs to be backed out and not included in Firefox 4.0 -- see [bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes") and [bug 629858](/show_bug.cgi?id=629858 "RESOLVED FIXED - strict warning \"function f does not always return a value\" can cause buffer overreads").

I agree with backing this out. (Although, to be fair, [bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes") was pre-existing, and this only happened to trigger that concomitant bad behavior.) I'll do the deed later tonight -- I have to push a patch to m-c, so I'm going to be around watching a tree anyway.
But really, hoary unchecked pointer arithmetic this close to release? For error messages only? This seems a quintessential non-hardblocker, at least fixed this way. If excess memory consumption for long-line errors is truly a hardblocker concern (I don't think it is), let's just "null out" the right fields and not provide source for long-line errors.

I found that paragraph hard to understand, but I think you're saying this bug shouldn't be a hardblocker. I agree, which is why we're backing it out; I'm assuming/hoping a higher-up will change this to blocking2.x and remove the "[hardblocker]" marking in the whiteboard.

I don't want to belabor it, but the point was that if we're talking something primarily affecting developers who use a console-like function, and the fix involves a bunch of unchecked pointer arithmetic (LOCAL\_ASSERT-style checks might have avoided real badness), it seems reasonably clear that deferring is the right thing to do now.

I've confirmed that both of these were pre-existing bugs that this patch just exposed. But we shouldn't include this patch in 4.0 just in case there are other similar latent bugs.

Seems to be the following script, which causes the problem:

Attached patch

[patch, v2](attachment.cgi?id=623569&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=623569&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=634444&attachment=623569)

This is a revived version of the old patch, which shows at most 121 chars in
an error message (the first char of the offending token, plus up to 60
chars before it, and up to 60 chars after it).
There's no test, unfortunately, because AFAIK you can't get the context in
an error message within JS code. I'd love to hear how a test might be
written for this.
I tested on winvistatips.com ([comment 37](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444#c37 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use")). Without the patch (and with
script option enabled and the error console open), the browser locks up.
With the patch there's a pause but then it works ok again fairly quickly.

This is still doing a depressing amount of raw pointer arithmetic of the sort that made me leery over a year ago here, but it looks like it checks out. Still I'm leery enough of this that I'd kind of like it if you held off landing this until after the next merge date, in a week and a few days. I'd really really really like to see this converted to use StringBuffer or something that does all the bounds-checking assertions for us. Maybe in a quick followup?

findEOLMax? I'd rather avoid phrase-y names when possible, just turns into a mouthful -- plus "not too far" is not exactly concise. Also make max size\_t, please.

The code shows the character, plus |windowRadius| characters before it, plus |windowRadius| characters after it. We seem to be interpreting "radius" differently in this discrete context, perhaps I should use a different name?

This version uses StringBuffer to construct |windowChars|. I had to expose StringBuffer::extractWellSized(). I've left |windowRadius| unchanged for now, but I've addressed the other nits.

Oh, hm. So you're showing an \*odd\* number of characters, then? That seems more than a bit strange. Let's show the even number and make radius mean half width, as everyone will definitely expect. (Whether they would expect the "radius" of an odd width to be as you have it in this patch, I dunno. Let's avoid the confusion entirely and use it in a way everyone will understand.)

You need to handle failure here. (extractWellSized can OOM if the characters are stored inline and allocation fails, or if realloc to the smaller length fails [possible with some libc implementations].)

Well, it's not \*necessarily\* the case people should do that. It'll depend on people's use cases. How about having something like this instead:
Creates a raw string from the characters in this buffer. The string is exactly the characters in this buffer: it is \*not\* null-terminated unless the last appended character was '\0'.

Using '\0' caused an ambiguous overloading of append(), so I stuck with |(jschar)0|.

The problematic code has been present in released code for over a year without causing too many real-world problems. It should ride the trains.

An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.

miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

## Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others

discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3982](/security/CVE-2012-3982), [CVE-2012-3983](/security/CVE-2012-3983), [CVE-2012-3988](/security/CVE-2012-3988), [CVE-2012-3989](/security/CVE-2012-3989),

[CVE-2012-4191](/security/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always

properly handle the  element. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.

([CVE-2012-3984](/security/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the

HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](/security/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform

security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](/security/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be

bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-3991](/security/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a

remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject

script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](/security/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that

allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-3993](/security/CVE-2012-3993), [CVE-2012-3994](/security/CVE-2012-3994), [CVE-2012-4184](/security/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in

Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker

could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context

of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3990](/security/CVE-2012-3990), [CVE-2012-3995](/security/CVE-2012-3995), [CVE-2012-4179](/security/CVE-2012-4179), [CVE-2012-4180](/security/CVE-2012-4180),

[CVE-2012-4181](/security/CVE-2012-4181), [CVE-2012-4182](/security/CVE-2012-4182), [CVE-2012-4183](/security/CVE-2012-4183), [CVE-2012-4185](/security/CVE-2012-4185), [CVE-2012-4186](/security/CVE-2012-4186),

[CVE-2012-4187](/security/CVE-2012-4187), [CVE-2012-4188](/security/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location

object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability

to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4192](/security/CVE-2012-4192), [CVE-2012-4193](/security/CVE-2012-4193))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-74

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:16.0/ rv:10.0.8)

Announced
October 9, 2012
Reporter
Mozilla Developers
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 16
* Firefox ESR 10.0.8
* SeaMonkey 2.13
* Thunderbird 16
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.8

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we
presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird
and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk
in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

### References

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox 15.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
