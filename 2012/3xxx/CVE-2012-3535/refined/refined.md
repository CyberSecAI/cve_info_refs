  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing validation of the 'numresolutions' field read from a JPEG2000 file. This value is used as an index into the 'tccp->prcw' array, and without proper validation, an attacker can supply a large value, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Missing input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause an application using OpenJPEG to crash or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by providing a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote, via specially crafted JPEG2000 image file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted JPEG2000 image file, and the target application needs to be processing this image using a vulnerable version of the OpenJPEG library."
