- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vBulletin application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying error messages related to exceeding the maximum allowed characters in the post title field ('subject' parameter).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when the victim views the error message. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A registered user adds a new post to the forum, providing a title ('subject' parameter) longer than 85 characters, including malicious JavaScript code. This triggers an error message containing the unsanitized input, leading to XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a registered user on the vBulletin forum.
