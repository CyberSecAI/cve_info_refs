{
  "CVE-2012-3962": {
    "description": "Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceape, an internet suite based on Seamonkey. The reported vulnerabilities could lead to the execution of arbitrary code or the bypass of content-loading restrictions via the location object.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A bad iterator in text runs, specifically in `nsTextFrameThebes.cpp`, occurs when `nsTextFrame::IsFloatingFirstLetterChild()` returns false because the text frame is missing `TEXT_FIRST_LETTER` (likely due to being zero-length). This leads to `BuildTextRuns()` not finding the line container for the first-letter's placeholder.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free",
       "Incorrect handling of text runs causing memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation could lead to application crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Triggering the vulnerable code path with crafted HTML content.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to serve crafted HTML content to the vulnerable application."
