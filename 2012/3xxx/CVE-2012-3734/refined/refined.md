- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Office Viewer would write a temporary file containing data from the viewed document to the temporary directory of the invoking process when viewing a Microsoft Office document.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unencrypted document data could be written to a temporary file, potentially exposing sensitive information if the invoking app uses data protection or encryption to protect user files.
- **Attack vectors:** Viewing a Microsoft Office document through the vulnerable Office Viewer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the device's filesystem to potentially read the temporary files created.
