- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer wrap vulnerability exists within the `img.exe` component of HP Intelligent Management Center when handling message packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability occurs due to arithmetic operations on unvalidated user-supplied values, which determine the size of a new heap buffer. This can cause an integer wrap, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `img.exe`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, targeting the `img.exe` process, which listens on TCP port 8800 by default.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing prior authentication by sending a specially crafted packet to the vulnerable service.
