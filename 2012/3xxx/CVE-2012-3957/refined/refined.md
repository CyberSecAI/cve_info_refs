{
  "CVE-2012-3957": {
    "description": "Heap-buffer-overflow in nsBlockFrame::MarkLineDirty",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow caused by an incorrect assumption about line lists when marking a line as dirty in `nsBlockFrame::MarkLineDirty`. Specifically, it assumes the previous sibling is on a normal line, when it might be on an overflow line. This results in an out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow",
      "Incorrect assumptions about line lists"
    ],
    "impact": "A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a denial of service via application crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted HTML page"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "User needs to be tricked into opening a specially crafted webpage.",
    "details": "The vulnerability occurs in `layout/generic/nsBlockFrame.cpp` and was caused by a change in the way line lists are handled. It is triggered when processing an overflow line and calling `MarkLineDirty` without the correct line list argument, leading to a read beyond allocated memory."
