- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in WebSphere MQ 7.1 SVRCONN channels allows client applications to bypass configured security settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper security enforcement on SVRCONN channels.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized users can gain access to the queue manager, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: Client applications connecting to a vulnerable WebSphere MQ 7.1 server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a client application capable of connecting to the WebSphere MQ server. The attacker also needs to be an unauthorized user.
