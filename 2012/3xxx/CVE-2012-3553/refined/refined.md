- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference in the Skinny channel driver occurs when a Station Key Pad Button Message is processed after an Off Hook message, due to an inappropriate dereference of a null pointer in Asterisk 10 releases.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Null pointer dereference vulnerability in the Skinny channel driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can cause a denial-of-service by crashing the Asterisk server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a Station Key Pad Button Message after a previously registered station sends an Off Hook message when a connection is closed to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A remote attacker with a valid SCCP ID needs to have a registered station and can trigger this by closing a connection when the station is in the "Off Hook" state.
