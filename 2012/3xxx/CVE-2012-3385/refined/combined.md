Seeing as how I have heard back from security@...dpress.org on another
matter, but not this one (nor has Steve said "don't do it" =), I can
only assume CVE #'s have not been assigned. If CVE's were issued for
these issues they have not been published anywhere I can find them.
Google:

site:wordpress.org CVE-2012

returns 12 results, most of which are CVE-2012-1835.

Please use CVE-2012-3383 for this issue.

Please use CVE-2012-3384 for this issue.

Please use CVE-2012-3385 for this issue.

Hopefully these are in fact only hardening issues and not security
issues, so no CVE. More details (like links to the code commits) would
be appreciated though.

On June 27, 2012, WordPress 3.4.1 was released to the public. This is a maintenance and security update.

For version 3.4.1, the [database version](https://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Database_version) (**db\_version** in **wp\_options**) changed to 21115.

## [Installation/Update Information](#installation-update-information)

To download WordPress 3.4.1, update automatically from the Dashboard > Updates menu in your site’s admin area or visit <https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/>.

For step-by-step instructions on installing and updating WordPress:

* [Updating WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/updating-wordpress/)

If you are new to WordPress, we recommend that you begin with the following:

* [New To WordPress – Where to Start](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/new_to_wordpress_-_where_to_start/)
* [First Steps With WordPress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/first-steps-with-wordpress/) or [Upgrading WordPress Extended](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/upgrading-wordpress-extended-instructions/)
* [WordPress Lessons](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-lessons/)

## [Summary](#summary)

From the [announcement post](https://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/), this maintenance release addresses 18 bugs with version 3.4, including:

* Fixes an issue where a theme’s page templates were sometimes not detected.
* Addresses problems with some category permalink structures.
* Better handling for plugins or themes loading JavaScript incorrectly.
* Adds early support for uploading images on iOS 6 devices.
* Allows for a technique commonly used by plugins to detect a network-wide activation.
* Better compatibility with servers running certain versions of PHP (5.2.4, 5.4) or with uncommon setups (safe mode, open\_basedir), which had caused warnings or in some cases prevented emails from being sent.

Additionally: Version 3.4.1 fixes a few security issues and contains some security hardening. These issues were discovered and fixed by the WordPress security team:

* Privilege Escalation/XSS. Critical. Administrators and editors in multisite were accidentally allowed to use unfiltered\_html for 3.4.0.
* CSRF. Additional CSRF protection in the customizer.
* Information Disclosure: Disclosure of post contents to authors and contributors (such as private or draft posts).
* Hardening: Deprecate wp\_explain\_nonce(), which could reveal unnecessary information.
* Hardening: Require a child theme to be activated with its intended parent only.

A full log of the changes made for 3.4.1 can be found at <https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?reponame=&new=21153%40branches%2F3.4&old=21076%40trunk>
