  "Root cause": "Insufficient permission checks in the java.beans MethodElementHandler implementation.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Insufficient permission checks allowing access to restricted methods and fields.",
    "Java sandbox bypass."
  ],
  "Impact": "A Java code running in the Java sandbox could use this flaw to bypass sandbox restrictions and run arbitrary code with the Java Virtual Machine privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Exploitation of the java.beans MethodElementHandler.",
    "Malicious Java code execution within a sandbox."
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute malicious Java code within a Java sandbox."
