The content relates to CVE-2012-3460.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- When Cumin is installed, it creates a "cumin" PostgreSQL user without a password and modifies `pg_hba.conf` to allow passwordless authentication for that user.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure default configuration: The PostgreSQL user is created without a password and the authentication configuration is modified to allow passwordless authentication.
- Weak role separation: By not requiring a password, a malicious user can bypass role separation by connecting to the PostgreSQL database.

Impact of exploitation:
- Privilege escalation: A regular Cumin user could submit a job that connects to the PostgreSQL database and modifies it to gain administrative privileges.

Attack vectors:
- Local access: An attacker with access to the same machine where Cumin and PostgreSQL are installed can exploit this vulnerability.
- Malicious job submission: A regular Cumin user can submit a job to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must have the ability to submit jobs to the Cumin service
- The attacker must have local access to the system where the Cumin service and Postgres database are running.
