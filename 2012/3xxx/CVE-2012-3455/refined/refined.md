Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-3455:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Microsoft Word document import filter within KOffice. Specifically, the issue is located in `filters/kword/msword-odf/wv2/src/styles.cpp` within the `grupx` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow when processing a malformed Word document. This occurs because the code does not properly validate input, leading to the `grupx` buffer overflowing when handling certain specially crafted documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running KOffice. This means an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the user's system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could also cause a denial of service by crashing the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Word Document:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted Microsoft Word document.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user or automated system into opening the malicious file with KOffice.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting a Malicious File:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed Microsoft Word document that triggers the buffer overflow.
*   **Social Engineering or Access:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the file or have access to an automated system that processes Word documents using KOffice.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by Charlie Miller during his Black Hat 2012 presentation. The presentation includes details about the exploit (page 39).
*   The vulnerability also affects Calligra, which is a fork of KOffice, and was assigned CVE-2012-3456.
*   Patches were made available in the KOffice Git repository (commit ID: `4e851f9`) as well as in the Calligra Git repository on the `2.4` branch (`7d72f7dd`), `2.5` branch (`f04d585c`), and the master branch (`8652ab67`).
*   Ubuntu released security updates to address this issue (USN-1526-1).
*   OpenSUSE also released a security update (openSUSE-SU-2012:1060-1) for this issue.

In summary, CVE-2012-3455 describes a buffer overflow in the KOffice MS Word import filter that allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by enticing a user to open a specially crafted document.
