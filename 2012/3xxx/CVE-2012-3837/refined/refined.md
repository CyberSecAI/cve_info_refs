Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-3837:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the Baby Gekko CMS application. Specifically, the CMS does not properly handle user-provided data when parsing parameters through both GET and POST methods. This allows attackers to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Multiple Stored (Persistent) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The CMS stores user input without proper sanitization, which enables an attacker to inject and store malicious JavaScript within the system's database. This stored script will be executed when other users access the affected content.
- **Multiple Reflected (Non-Persistent) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The CMS reflects user-supplied input directly back to the user in the browser without sanitization. This allows an attacker to craft a link with malicious JavaScript. When a user clicks on the link, the script executes in the user's browser.
- **Path Disclosure:** The CMS reveals the full installation path of the affected CMS. This can provide attackers with more information about the system's structure, potentially aiding further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Theft of sensitive information
    - Redirection to malicious websites
- **Path Disclosure:** The attacker can obtain the full installation path of the affected CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** Reflected XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited through specially crafted URLs.
- **HTTP POST Requests:** Stored XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by submitting malicious data through forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Knowledge of Web Application Exploitation:** The attacker needs knowledge of web application vulnerabilities and how to craft malicious payloads.
- **Access to Vulnerable CMS:** The attacker needs access to the Baby Gekko CMS to exploit the vulnerabilities. For stored XSS, they need to be able to interact with forms. Reflected XSS can be achieved by tricking users into clicking malicious links.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Baby Gekko CMS version 1.1.5c.
- The identified vulnerabilities include both reflected and stored XSS, along with path disclosure.
- The advisory mentions specific parameters that are vulnerable to XSS.
- The vendor released a patched version (1.2.0) to address these issues.
- The advisory ID is ZSL-2012-5086.
- The researcher who discovered these vulnerabilities is Gjoko Krstic (LiquidWorm).
- The content also includes proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits demonstrating the vulnerability.
