The provided content relates to CVE-2012-3452.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A commit in gnome-screensaver 3.4.2, specifically  `43ee32ed` which changed the drawing area associated with each monitor's screensaver window to get realized early. This resulted in the screensaver not properly locking all monitors in a multi-monitor setup.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The screensaver failed to lock all displays in a multi-monitor setup.
- Secondary monitors remained visible and usable even when the screen was locked.
- Input (mouse/keyboard) could still interact with applications on the unlocked displays.
- In some cases, the password dialog was not visible on the primary monitor either, making the system effectively unusable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the system as the screensaver did not properly prevent access to running applications on unlocked secondary displays.
- Potential exposure of sensitive data or ongoing work.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability was triggered when the user locked the screen in a multi-monitor setup using gnome-screensaver 3.4.2.
- An attacker in a physical proximity of the system could take advantage of the unlocked displays.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to a system with a multi-monitor setup running the vulnerable version of gnome-screensaver.
- No special technical skills are required to exploit this vulnerability as the secondary display remains usable by default.
