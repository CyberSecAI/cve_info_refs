- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An invalid pointer dereference issue existed in the kernel's handling of packet filter ioctls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Invalid pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges, allowing an attacker to alter kernel memory.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user must be able to interact with the device.
