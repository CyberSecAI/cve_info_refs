  "CVE-2012-3988": {
    "Description": "Security researcher Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may be potentially exploitable.",
    "Root cause": "A timing-dependent use-after-free pointer reference during full-screen mode and history navigation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A hang or crash, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Invoking full-screen mode and then navigating backwards in the browser history.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to trick a user into performing the required actions in a browser or browser-like context.",
        "Affected_components": [
      "Firefox",
      "Firefox ESR",
      "SeaMonkey",
      "Thunderbird",
      "Thunderbird ESR"
        ],
    "More_Info": "The vulnerability exists in the nsDocShell::RestoreFromHistory function where view pointers are used after they may have been freed due to script execution during page navigation, particularly during full screen mode transitions. The vulnerability is addressed by re-retrieving the view pointers in `nsDocShell::RestoreFromHistory()` by storing references to the parent/sibling views' content nodes and verifying that the new root view has not already been inserted into the view manager hierarchy."
