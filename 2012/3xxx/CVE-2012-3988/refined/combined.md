| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=863621#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-06 05:10:32 UTC  ``` Mozilla community member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-81.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Alice White as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=863621#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:33:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1351 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1351.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=863621#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:53:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1350 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1350.html>   ``` |  |

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-79

## DOS and crash with full screen and history navigation

Announced
October 9, 2012
Reporter
Soroush Dalili
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 16
* Firefox ESR 10.0.8
* SeaMonkey 2.13
* Thunderbird 16
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.8

### Description

Security researcher **Soroush Dalili** reported that a
combination of invoking full screen mode and navigating backwards in history
could, in some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing dependent
use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may be potentially exploitable.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

Attached file
[mozFullScreen-Back-Crash.html](attachment.cgi?id=595841)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=595841&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/535.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/17.0.963.46 Safari/535.11
Steps to reproduce:
When history.length is greater than 1 (back button is enabled) and user initiate the click button:
Calling the "mozRequestFullScreen()" function and then "history.go(-1)" can cause a crash or a DoS in Mozilla Firefox.
I have created a test case that will replicate the issue.
As the Offset value can change, it can be a security issue as well. However, I could not find out the reason for this offset change.
Please also verify if it can be a case for the bug bounty.
Actual results:
Mozilla Firefox show the crash reporter
Or
It becomes unresponsive
If you cannot see this result, please use the provided attach file and do it again. Note: Your history should not be empty.
Expected results:
It should disable the full screen and then redirect the user to the previous page.

Added this to the bounty nomination queue, but at first glance those crashes look like null derefs and probably not exploitable. We need to run this under Valgrind or ASan to see if there's some worse memory abuse masquerading as a safe crash.

I don't have a debug build of Firefox 10 available. Do you need a valgrind report on it?

Bob: yes, please run Valgrind on Fx10. (also Christian, start with Fx10 rather than trunk if ASan runs on the older builds). If you still have them please also attach your Valgrind output for one of the beta runs (or both if they're different).
Looks like the crash may be something we fixed already, but it could just different symptoms due to the way code has moved around. If Fx10 turns up a different memory problem we should file a separate bug on the uninitialized memory.

|  | |

Ok, I took an initial look at this. Because I did not have a Fx10 ASan build handy, I started with trunk which was readily available. And it turns out that at least on trunk, this is neither fixed, nor a simple null deref.
Rather, I see a use-after-free in ASan both on debug and opt builds (64 bit). However, I'm having problems getting a symbolized trace (likely unrelated to this particular issue though). I'll try to get symbols into the trace and will attach it then. I'll also try to take another look with Valgrind because both tools should be able to see this.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=598734&action=edit)

Okay, there seems to be a bug in the ASan symbolizer code but I managed to work around and wrote my own symbolizer script. Attached is the symbolized log for this testcase on Firefox Trunk (m-c rev 307a032f2007).
Strangely enough, Valgrind does not see this issue at all, although it should.

Valgrind's use-after-free tracking is imperfect -- it holds onto freed blocks for a while in order to detect them, but eventually the blocks are recycled.
Christian, does Valgrind detect it if you run it with --freelist-vol=200000000? That makes Valgrind hold onto blocks for 10x longer than the default.

You were right :) Now I see the issue also in Valgrind:

I tried a release debug build on OS X 10.5, Fedora 16 32 and 64 bit though I could reproduce the crash without valgrind I was never able to reproduce the crash with valgrind. I think timing issues prevent the crash with valgrind. On Mac and and Linux 32 bit I was able to get a similar invalid read though. I used an old svn 3.7 build on Mac and a current svn 3.8 build on Linux without needing the --freelist option.

It could be due to timing issues or different memory layout. See <http://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/faq.html#faq.crashes>

Might also be worth trying --fair-sched=yes, which changes the running order
of threads to be more fine-grainedly interleaved. Only works with V trunk
on Linux, not on OSX.

Here's a bit of analysis w.r.t. the trace shown below (which is the
same as in [comment #16](/show_bug.cgi?id=725770#c16 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox crashes by mozRequestFullScreen and history.back function")). It has to do with nsDocShell.cpp:
7272 // Insert the new root view at the correct location in the view tree.
7273 if (rootViewParent) {
7274 nsIViewManager \*parentVM = rootViewParent->GetViewManager();
7275
7276 if (parentVM && newRootView) {
...
7284 parentVM->InsertChild(rootViewParent, newRootView,
7285 rootViewSibling,
7286 rootViewSibling ? true : false);
It appears that at 7273, rootViewParent points at an object that has
already been freed. At 7274, the second word of the object is read,
triggering the complaint. The word is passed tp GetViewManager() and
that returns it unchanged -- from reading the object code, is the
identity fn.
So we now have parentVM being junk hauled out of a potentially
reallocated object, could be any value. If it's nonzero then
at 7284 we're very likely to crash when doing something with it.
Crashy? Definitely. Exploitable? I don't know.

I cannot reproduce this on [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20120301 Firefox/13.0a1].
Is this fixed on trunk?
I won't be able to try on other platforms until I go back into work on Monday, NZST.

So I can reproduce this on my x64 Linux box at the office and in my 32bit WinXP VM at least, but not on my primary Win7 x64 laptop.
If I apply the (review denied) patch in [Bug 708553](/show_bug.cgi?id=708553 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hovered element state is not relinquished when entering and exiting fullscreen mode") the crash goes away. This implies to me that this crash is caused by reframing the document when we transition between fullscreen and normal mode. In fullscreen mode we apply a position:fixed CSS style which cause the document presentation to be recreated, which I'm guessing is messing with rootViewParent here?
So presumably fixing [bug 708553](/show_bug.cgi?id=708553 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hovered element state is not relinquished when entering and exiting fullscreen mode") will fix this bug. To fix [bug 708553](/show_bug.cgi?id=708553 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hovered element state is not relinquished when entering and exiting fullscreen mode") we're proposing to make frame reconstruction not destroy/recreate the subdocument presentation. That fix will be tricky, and I imagine not something we should rush onto beta/aurora.
bz, roc or tn may be able to figure out a simpler fix, I'm not a layout expert yet. ;)Depends on: [708553](/show_bug.cgi?id=708553 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hovered element state is not relinquished when entering and exiting fullscreen mode")

Looks like the SetCurrentURI call in nsDocShell::RestoreFromHistory can call script (via nsDocLoader::FireOnLocationChange and nsBrowserStatusFilter::OnLocationChange) and hence lead to flushing and that can destroy anything.
Even if we fix the full screen problem this problem would still exist, no? So we should fix this too.

The view pointers in this function seem to be the only non-nsCOMPtrs, so everything else is safe. We'd either need to use weak views to tell when they get deleted, or store something else and reget the views we need from it, like the content node of the iframe containing this docshell. There are currently no uses of weak views in the tree, so if we can avoid that we can delete the weak view code.

I have a build with a fix coming through Try now here:
<https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=4a529f7578a7>
Looks like it's going green.
The fix is based on Timothy's suggestion of using nsWeakViews instead of raw pointers in nsDocShell::RestoreFromHistory(). I couldn't get Timothy's other suggestion to work (storing parent frame's content node, retrieving view from that) the parent's content node kept being null for some reason I don't understand. I had to alter nsWeakView, since it couldn't handle the case where the view outlives nsWeakView, as nsWeakView wasn't clearing the nsIView->nsWeakView reference upon its destruction.

rootViewParent is actually the anonymous inner view of the subdocument frame, meaning it does not have a corresponding frame (its client data is null). So you wouldn't be able to get a content node from it. You'd have to look at rootViewParent's parent.

Based on [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=725770#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox crashes by mozRequestFullScreen and history.back function") and the description of the fix in [comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=725770#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - Firefox crashes by mozRequestFullScreen and history.back function") this definitely looks exploitable in theory. We can argue about how hard it might be to turn into a reliable attack but we should save the energy and just fix it.

Attached patch

[Patch: re-retrieve the view references](attachment.cgi?id=604800&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=604800&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=725770&attachment=604800)

As an alternative to my other patch, instead re-retrieve the view pointers in nsDocShell::RestoreFromHistory() by storing references to the parent/sibling views' content nodes.
Note I need to guard against the newRootView already having been inserted in the rootViewParent's tree because transitioning to/from fullscreen mode can cause the containing frame to be re-framed, which creates the view. (For a call stack of the newRootView being inserted, see: <http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1514716> ).
Greenish on Try: <https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=65d9e9a5f1c5>
Once this on nightlies, we'll want some QA testing on browser going back/forward in history, in particular (but not only) from pages that are in fullscreen mode (for example an HTML5 video running in fullscreen mode).

Ok, thanks for the stack. I want to think a little bit about whether the reconstruct reinserting the view is okay here because this is one of the few key points where we mess with inserting/removing root views.

Boris, in nsDocShell::RestoreFromHistory we fetch and save a view parent pointer and a view sibling pointer to know where to insert the root view for the document that we are navigating to. It then does some stuff and then inserts the new root view. However the SetCurrentURI call in RestoreFromHistory can run script, and its possible to destroy those views. In this testcase we destroy and reconstruct the subdocument frame holding this docshell. This inserts the root view of the document so when we get to insert the root view we find it is already there. Boris, do you have an opinion if this is an okay thing to happen?

Which part of it? SetCurrentURI running script, or the reconstruct per se?
SetCurrentURI is triggering chrome-only script via onLocationChange, right?
In a sane world there would be some scriptblockers here or something, but I'm worried about changing the code flow... We could try telling SetCurrentURI to not fire onLocationChange, and do it ourselves after we hook up the views. Or we could try to detect when we actually get reframed during onLocationChange and skip the view hookup.

This is what Chris' patch does, it just checks if the new root view is inserted into the view manager hierarchy already. We could try your other suggestion, not sure which approach is better.

Perhaps because we're transitioning between two documents in the <iframe>, and so there's two documents in the <iframe>, each of which has it's own nsIFrame and view?
I'm not sure... I don't know this code very well... Perhaps we should just take my earlier nsWeakViews patch and be done with this? We \*do\* need to do something here though, this crash is apparently exploitable.

OK. Let me rephrase. I think that the rootViewSibling parts of the attached patch are just wrong. The right thing is probably to verify that it is the view of its frame and then to hold on to the \_content\_ pointer and reget its primary frame (if any) and its view (if any). But I'm not sure what the right thing to do is in cases when those end up null (or in the weakview case when the weakview goes null). :(

OK, Timothy explained to me what's going on with rootViewSibling. The patch now makes sense, but needs a lot more comments to explain what's going on (in particular, that rootViewSibling is from some random other document).

Patch v3: More comments...
I think what we should document in addition to this is the following:
1) rootViewParent is the inner view of the parent iframe, if any.
2) rootViewSibling is the root view for another document loaded in the same
iframe as us; this is only non-null in the middle of a page transition.
#2 is important because it explains why getting rootViewSibling off an nsIDocument as the root view of it's presshell is reasonable.
r=me with those bits.

Since this bug has been designated as exploitable, how should I land this fix?
Should I strip the comments from my patch and land that with a comment containing only the bug number, and come back and land the comments once it ships? Or should I just land the patch as is?
We should at least take this patch on Aurora as well, we're perhaps too close to the end of the beta cycle to risk landing it on beta.

Patch 1 of 2: Code changes
[Approval Request Comment]
Bug caused by (feature/regressing bug #): Fullscreen API
User impact if declined: This patch fixes an exploitable crash, which can ocur when navigating "back" away from a fullscreen page.
Testing completed (on m-c, etc.): Local testing, been on m-c for several days.
Risk to taking this patch (and alternatives if risky): Could cause regressions. We should take this on Aurora and monitor for crashes when pressing the UI back button. I wouldn't feel comfortable taking this on Beta this close to the end of the cycle.
String or UUID changes made by this patch: None.

An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

dropdown menu can be used for URL spoofing, other evil
Firefox 10.0.1 : Navigation away from a page with
multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*
CVE-2012-3995: Out of bounds read in
IsCSSWordSpacingSpace
\*
CVE-2012-4179: Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn
\*
CVE-2012-4180: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace
\*
CVE-2012-4181: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILAnimationController::DoSample
\*
CVE-2012-4182: Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditRules::WillInsert
\*
CVE-2012-4183: Heap-use-after-free in
DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures
\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-4185: Global-buffer-overflow in
nsCharTraits::length
\*
CVE-2012-4186: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData
\*
CVE-2012-4187: Crash with ASSERTION: insPos too small
\*
CVE-2012-4188: Heap-buffer-overflow in Convolve3x3
\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others

discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3982](/security/CVE-2012-3982), [CVE-2012-3983](/security/CVE-2012-3983), [CVE-2012-3988](/security/CVE-2012-3988), [CVE-2012-3989](/security/CVE-2012-3989),

[CVE-2012-4191](/security/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always

properly handle the  element. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.

([CVE-2012-3984](/security/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the

HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](/security/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform

security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](/security/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be

bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-3991](/security/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a

remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject

script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](/security/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that

allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-3993](/security/CVE-2012-3993), [CVE-2012-3994](/security/CVE-2012-3994), [CVE-2012-4184](/security/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in

Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker

could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context

of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3990](/security/CVE-2012-3990), [CVE-2012-3995](/security/CVE-2012-3995), [CVE-2012-4179](/security/CVE-2012-4179), [CVE-2012-4180](/security/CVE-2012-4180),

[CVE-2012-4181](/security/CVE-2012-4181), [CVE-2012-4182](/security/CVE-2012-4182), [CVE-2012-4183](/security/CVE-2012-4183), [CVE-2012-4185](/security/CVE-2012-4185), [CVE-2012-4186](/security/CVE-2012-4186),

[CVE-2012-4187](/security/CVE-2012-4187), [CVE-2012-4188](/security/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location

object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

## Synopsis

Critical: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1351)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3982,
CVE-2012-3988, CVE-2012-3990, CVE-2012-3995, CVE-2012-4179, CVE-2012-4180,
CVE-2012-4181, CVE-2012-4182, CVE-2012-4183, CVE-2012-4185, CVE-2012-4186,
CVE-2012-4187, CVE-2012-4188)

Two flaws in Thunderbird could allow malicious content to bypass intended
restrictions, possibly leading to information disclosure, or Thunderbird
executing arbitrary code. Note that the information disclosure issue could
possibly be combined with other flaws to achieve arbitrary code execution.
(CVE-2012-3986, CVE-2012-3991)

Multiple flaws were found in the location object implementation in
Thunderbird. Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site
scripting attacks, script injection, or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2012-1956,
CVE-2012-3992, CVE-2012-3994)

Two flaws were found in the way Chrome Object Wrappers were implemented.
Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site scripting attacks or
cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-3993, CVE-2012-4184)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Soroush Dalili,
miaubiz, Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen, Johnny Stenback, Alice White,
moz\_bug\_r\_a4, and Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporters of these
issues.

Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.8 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=863619#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-06 05:01:17 UTC  ``` Security researcher Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may be potentially exploitable.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-79.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Soroush Dalili as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=863619#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:33:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1351 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1351.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=863619#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:53:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1350 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1350.html>   ``` |  |

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
