  "CVE-2012-3571": {
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way the dhcpd daemon handled zero-length client identifiers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to dhcpd, possibly causing it to enter an infinite loop and consume an excessive amount of CPU time.",
    "root_cause": "The DHCP server incorrectly handled certain malformed client identifiers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause the DHCP server to enter an infinite loop, consuming excessive CPU and preventing the DHCP server from processing further requests.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker sends a specially crafted DHCP request to the DHCP server.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send DHCP requests to the server. No authentication is required."
