Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3817:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from `launchpad.net`, `www.ubuntu.com`, `rhn.redhat.com` and `lists.opensuse.org` directly references **CVE-2012-3817** and describes a vulnerability in BIND related to DNSSEC validation.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from an **uninitialized data structure** being used in BIND's failing query cache during DNSSEC validation, specifically in the `lib/dns/resolver.c` file.
   - This occurs when a large number of DNS queries, especially those requiring DNSSEC validation, are processed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Improper Initialization:** The core issue is that the software attempts to use a variable related to the expiry of a failing query (`bad->expire`) before it has been properly set/initialized.
   - **Use-Before-Initialization:** This leads to accessing potentially invalid or garbage data which results in the assertion failure and service crash.
   - **Incorrect Cache Handling:** There's a flaw in how BIND manages its cache of failing queries.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service, as the vulnerable BIND server crashes due to the assertion failure.
   - **Service Disruption:** The BIND DNS server becomes unavailable, disrupting name resolution for clients using that server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Remote Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely by sending specially crafted network traffic to a BIND server.
   - **DNS Queries:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a large number of DNS queries that require DNSSEC validation to trigger the vulnerable code path.
   - **DNSSEC Required:** DNSSEC validation needs to be enabled in BIND for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target DNS server.
   - **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** An attacker would need knowledge of this specific flaw to craft the queries that would trigger it.

**Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerability is located in `lib/dns/resolver.c`.
   - The fix involves ensuring that `bad->expire` is correctly initialized before use.
   - Patches were backported from BIND version 9.7.6-P2.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The vulnerability is specifically triggered under conditions of high query loads while DNSSEC validation is active.
   - Various Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Red Hat, openSUSE, and Slackware provided security updates to address this issue in their respective bind9 packages.
