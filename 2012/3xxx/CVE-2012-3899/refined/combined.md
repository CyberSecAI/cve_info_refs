SERVICE PACK NOTE
This SERVICE PACK addresses the issues described in the RESOLVED ISSUES
section of this document.
This service pack is being used as a release vehicle to repair critical
sensor failures.
This service pack contains the S549 signature level, but preserves any
more recent signature levels installed on your sensor.

6.2(4)E4 SERVICE PACK UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS AND DETAILS
NOTE: You must have a valid maintenance contract per sensor to
receive and use software upgrades including signature updates from
Cisco.com.
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
To install the IPS-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg, IPS-NME-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg, or
IPS-AIM-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg service pack version upgrade file, you must be
running IPS version 5.1(6)E3 or later on your sensor.
NOTE: The IPS-AIM-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg upgrade file can only be used to
upgrade AIM-IPS sensors. The IPS-NME-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg upgrade file can
only be used to upgrade NME-IPS sensors. The IPS-SSC\_5-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg
can only be used to upgrade AIP SSC5 sensors. For all other supported sensors,
use the IPS-K9-6.2.4-E4.pkg upgrade file.
To see what version the sensor is currently running, log in to the CLI
and execute the 'show version' command.
For detailed instructions on installing the service pack upgrade file,
refer to "Upgrading, Downgrading, and Installing System Images," in
Configuring the Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Sensor Using
the Command Line Interface 6.2 available at this URL:

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
The following IPS/IDS platforms are supported:
- IPS 4240 Series Appliance Sensor
- IPS 4255 Series Appliance Sensor
- IPS 4260 Series Appliance Sensor
- IPS 4270 Series Appliance Sensor
- IDSM2 for Catalyst 6500
- AIP SSC-5 for ASA 5505
- AIP SSM-10 for ASA 5500
- AIP SSM-20 for ASA 5500
- AIP SSM-40 for ASA 5500

The following platforms are no longer supported:
- IDS-4210 Series Appliance Sensor
- IDS-4215 Series Appliance Sensor
- IDS-4235 Series Appliance Sensor
- IDS-4250 Series Appliance Sensor
- NM-CIDS for Cisco 26xx, 3660, and 37xx Router Families
INSTALLATION USING THE CLI
NOTE: You must be logged on to Cisco.com using an account with
cryptographic privileges to access the download site, and you must have
a SMARTnet maintenance contract number to request software upgrades from
Cisco.com.
NOTE: This service pack requires an automatic reboot of the sensor to
apply the changes. Inline network traffic will be disrupted during the
reboot.
To install the 6.2(4)E4 service pack using the CLI, follow these steps:
1. Download the file IPS-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg to a local server.
Note: The AIM, NME, and SSC-5 devices require their own platform-specific
package as listed above.
2. Log in to the CLI using an account with administrator privileges.
3. Type the following command to enter configuration mode:
configure terminal
4. Type the following command to upgrade the sensor:
sensor(config)# upgrade [URL]/IPS-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg
where the [URL] is a uniform resource locator pointing to where
the package is located. For example, to retrieve the update via
SCP, type the following:
sensor(config)# upgrade scp://@///
IPS-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg
The available transport methods are SCP, FTP, HTTP, or HTTPS.
5. Enter the appropriate password when prompted.
6. To complete the upgrade, type yes when prompted.
7. The sensor reboots to finish applying the changes.
To determine whether the 6.2(4)E4 service pack has successfully been
installed on a sensor, log in to the CLI and type 'show version' at the
command prompt. The sensor will report the version as 6.2(4)E4, and the
Upgrade History should include IPS-K9-6.2-4-E4.pkg.
INSTALLATION CAVEATS
The 6.2(4)E4 service pack cannot be uninstalled. You must re-image the
sensor using a system image file, which causes all configuration settings
to be lost. The install behavior of this service pack is that all
executables,libraries, and so forth are replaced but user configuration
is preserved. The reason for this upgrade behavior change is that this
service pack contains changes to libraries and drivers.
RESOLVED ISSUES
The following known issues have been resolved in the 6.2(4)E4 service pack
release. Release notes can be viewed in Bug Navigator at the following
