Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The WordPress plugin "Count Per Day" version 3.1.1 is vulnerable to multiple XSS issues due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `userperspan.php` file. Specifically, the `page`, `datemin`, and `datemax` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize the `page`, `datemin`, and `datemax` parameters in `userperspan.php`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page.
*  **Reflected XSS:** The injected JavaScript is reflected back to the user's browser when the vulnerable page is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Account Compromise:**  An attacker can potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information, leading to account compromise.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the website's appearance, redirect users to other websites or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Malicious code can be used to impersonate legitimate login forms and harvest user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `userperspan.php` file with malicious JavaScript code injected into the `page`, `datemin`, or `datemax` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and persuade a victim to visit them. No specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker can use social engineering to entice users to click on a malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.2 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was identified and reported by Stefan Schurtz.
*   The provided content gives a clear picture of the vulnerable parameters, the file, the exploitation and the fix.
