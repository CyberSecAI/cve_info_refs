Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3552:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper synchronization when manipulating the `inet->opt` (IP options) structure within the Linux kernel's networking subsystem. Specifically, the `ip_make_skb()` function calls `ip_setup_cork()`, which might create a copy of the `ipc->opt` structure. However, there was no protection against other threads concurrently modifying `inet->opt`, leading to a race condition. This could result in a thread using a stale or freed `inet->opt` pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Race condition:** Concurrent access to `inet->opt` without proper locking or synchronization.
*   **Use-after-free:**  A thread can potentially access the `ip_options` structure after another thread has freed it.
*   **Slab corruption:** Memory corruption in the kernel's slab allocator, as threads may try to operate on freed or stale memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):**  The primary impact of successful exploitation is a kernel crash, resulting in a system-wide denial of service. This could be triggered by a remote attacker with specific crafted network traffic or by a local, unprivileged user. The vulnerability can cause the system to crash.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While not the primary concern, the bug report mentions that a potential privilege escalation impact could not be ruled out.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:**  A remote attacker could trigger the vulnerability by sending network traffic to a vulnerable server application that uses socket options and processes traffic over the same socket concurrently. This could potentially trigger the race condition.
*   **Local:** A local, unprivileged user could also trigger the vulnerability, likely without needing any specific application running or crafted traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker would need to be able to send traffic to a vulnerable system. The attacker would need knowledge of vulnerable server applications running on the target system that are using IP options.
*   **Local:** The attacker would need to have access to a local user account on the vulnerable system. No special privileges are needed.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided content includes a link to the upstream fix: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=f6d8bd051c391c1c0458a30b2a7abcd939329259>. This fix uses RCU (Read-Copy-Update) to protect access to `inet->opt`, which was renamed to `inet->inet_opt`. The fix also includes changes to avoid cache line dirtying by copying ip\_options structures when necessary.
*   The vulnerability affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6. It did not affect Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2. Patches were released for RHEL 5 and 6.
*   The vulnerability was assigned a "moderate" severity by Red Hat.
*   The bug was reported by Hafid Lin.
