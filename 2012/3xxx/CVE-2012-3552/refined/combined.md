| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2012-05-18 04:22:02 UTC  ``` Reported by Li Honggang (internal): Attempting an rds connection from the IP address of an IPoIB interface to itself causes a kernel panic due to a BUG_ON() being triggered.  Making the test less strict allows rds-ping to work without crashing the machine.  A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the sytem.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c4)  Petr Matousek    2012-06-05 18:04:54 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux MRG. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-06-18 13:35:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0743 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0743.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c6)  Murray McAllister    2012-12-04 03:59:47 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Li Honggang of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=822754#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 20:53:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1540 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1540.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=853465#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-31 15:57:44 UTC  ``` Description of the problem: Lack proper synchronization to manipulate inet->opt ip_options can lead to system crash.  Problem is that ip_make_skb() calls ip_setup_cork() and ip_setup_cork() possibly makes a copy of ipc->opt (struct ip_options), without any protection against another thread manipulating inet->opt. Another thread can change inet->opt pointer and free old one under us.  Given right server application (setting socket options and processing traffic over the same socket at the same time), remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. More likely though, local unprivileged user could use this  flaw to crash the system.  Potential privilege escalation impact cannot be ruled out.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1540)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues, two bugs, and
add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages contain the Linux kernel.

Security fixes:

* A race condition in the way asynchronous I/O and fallocate() interacted

when using ext4 could allow a local, unprivileged user to obtain random
data from a deleted file. (CVE-2012-4508, Important)

* A flaw in the way the Xen hypervisor implementation range checked guest

provided addresses in the XENMEM\_exchange hypercall could allow a
malicious, para-virtualized guest administrator to crash the hypervisor or,
potentially, escalate their privileges, allowing them to execute arbitrary
code at the hypervisor level. (CVE-2012-5513, Important)

* A flaw in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation

could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.
(CVE-2012-2372, Moderate)

* A race condition in the way access to inet->opt ip\_options was

synchronized in the Linux kernel's TCP/IP protocol suite implementation.
Depending on the network facing applications running on the system, a
remote attacker could possibly trigger this flaw to cause a denial of
service. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial
of service regardless of the applications the system runs. (CVE-2012-3552,
Moderate)

* The Xen hypervisor implementation did not properly restrict the period

values used to initialize per VCPU periodic timers. A privileged guest user
could cause an infinite loop on the physical CPU. If the watchdog were
enabled, it would detect said loop and panic the host system.
(CVE-2012-4535, Moderate)

* A flaw in the way the Xen hypervisor implementation handled

set\_p2m\_entry() error conditions could allow a privileged,
fully-virtualized guest user to crash the hypervisor. (CVE-2012-4537,
Moderate)

Red Hat would like to thank Theodore Ts'o for reporting CVE-2012-4508; the
Xen project for reporting CVE-2012-5513, CVE-2012-4535, and CVE-2012-4537;
and Hafid Lin for reporting CVE-2012-3552. Upstream acknowledges Dmitry
Monakhov as the original reporter of CVE-2012-4508. CVE-2012-2372 was
discovered by Li Honggang of Red Hat.

Bug fixes:

* Previously, the interrupt handlers of the qla2xxx driver could clear

pending interrupts right after the IRQ lines were attached during system
start-up. Consequently, the kernel could miss the interrupt that reported
completion of the link initialization, and the qla2xxx driver then failed
to detect all attached LUNs. With this update, the qla2xxx driver has been
modified to no longer clear interrupt bits after attaching the IRQ lines.
The driver now correctly detects all attached LUNs as expected. (BZ#870118)

* The Ethernet channel bonding driver reported the MII (Media Independent

Interface) status of the bond interface in 802.3ad mode as being up even
though the MII status of all of the slave devices was down. This could pose
a problem if the MII status of the bond interface was used to determine if
failover should occur. With this update, the agg\_device\_up() function has
been added to the bonding driver, which allows the driver to report the
link status of the bond interface correctly, that is, down when all of its
slaves are down, in the 802.3ad mode. (BZ#877943)

Enhancements:

* This update backports several changes from the latest upstream version of

the bnx2x driver. The most important change, the remote-fault link
detection feature, allows the driver to periodically scan the physical link
layer for remote faults. If the physical link appears to be up and a fault
is detected, the driver indicates that the link is down. When the fault is
cleared, the driver indicates that the link is up again. (BZ#870120)

* The INET socket interface has been modified to send a warning message

when the ip\_options structure is allocated directly by a third-party module
using the kmalloc() function. (BZ#874973)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues and add these enhancements. The system must
be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

inet: add RCU protection to inet->opt

```
We lack proper synchronization to manipulate inet->opt ip_options

Problem is ip_make_skb() calls ip_setup_cork() and
ip_setup_cork() possibly makes a copy of ipc->opt (struct ip_options),
without any protection against another thread manipulating inet->opt.

Another thread can change inet->opt pointer and free old one under us.

Use RCU to protect inet->opt (changed to inet->inet_opt).

Instead of handling atomic refcounts, just copy ip_options when
necessary, to avoid cache line dirtying.

We cant insert an rcu_head in struct ip_options since its included in
skb->cb[], so this patch is large because I had to introduce a new
ip_options_rcu structure.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=869904#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-10-25 06:21:58 UTC  ``` A race condition flaw has been found in the way asynchronous I/O and fallocate interacted which can lead to exposure of stale data -- that is, an extent which should have had the "uninitialized" bit set indicating that its blocks have not yet been written and thus contain data from a deleted file. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to cause an information leak.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Theodore Ts'o for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Dmitry Monakhov as the original reporter.  References:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=dee1f973ca341c266229faa5a1a5bb268bed3531>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=869904#c1)  Petr Matousek    2012-10-25 06:24:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 633181](attachment.cgi?id=633181) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=633181&action=edit) Upstream patches  Theodore Ts'o writes:  "There are two ways of patching this bug.  One is to apply the entire set of AIO/DIO race fixes, which will fix a number of other bugs (some of which can cause the system to deadlock if the right stress tester is run).  All but the last two patches in the enclosed tar file are in the ext4.git tree and will shortly be pushed to Linus.  The last two will fix stale data exposure bug.  A simpler fix is to simply apply the last patch in this patch series. This should work on all older kernels; the downside of applying just the last patch is that there is a slight risk of data loss if the file system is full at the point where we have the AIO/fallocate race, *AND* the leaf node in extent tree is full, requiring a block allocation in order to split an extent so we can mark part of the extent as being uninitialized.  This is a very hard-to-hit corner case, so it should be OK to just apply the last patch in this series.  Applying the entire patch series will allow us to significantly reduce the chances of this corner case happening.  The enclosed tar file has these patches ported to the 3.6 kernel; it should not be hard to make them apply for older kernels as necessary."  The last patch is also referenced in [comment#0](show_bug.cgi?id=869904#c0).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=869904#c5)  Petr Matousek    2012-10-25 06:29:36 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 869909](show_bug.cgi?id=869909 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-4508 kernel: ext4: AIO vs fallocate stale data exposure [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=869904#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 19:59:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1491 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1491.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=869904#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 20:53:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1540 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1540.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=869904#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 06:53:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0496 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0496.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=869904#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-11-13 18:54:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2013:1519 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1519.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=869904#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-12-05 17:09:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 EUS - Server and Compute Node Only  Via RHSA-2013:1783 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1783.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=853465#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-31 15:57:44 UTC  ``` Description of the problem: Lack proper synchronization to manipulate inet->opt ip_options can lead to system crash.  Problem is that ip_make_skb() calls ip_setup_cork() and ip_setup_cork() possibly makes a copy of ipc->opt (struct ip_options), without any protection against another thread manipulating inet->opt. Another thread can change inet->opt pointer and free old one under us.  Given right server application (setting socket options and processing traffic over the same socket at the same time), remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. More likely though, local unprivileged user could use this  flaw to crash the system.  Potential privilege escalation impact cannot be ruled out.  Upstream fix: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=f6d8bd051c391c1c0458a30b2a7abcd939329259>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=853465#c1)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-31 16:08:32 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
