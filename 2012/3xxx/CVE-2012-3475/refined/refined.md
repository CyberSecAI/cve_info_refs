Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-3475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Ushahidi installer, specifically how it handles redirects after installation is initiated. The installer does not properly terminate the script execution after redirecting to the installer page when the application has not been configured. This allows an attacker to repeatedly trigger the installer even after the initial installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Admin User Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack an administrator account because the installer could be re-executed even after a valid admin account has been created.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** By re-running the installer, an attacker could set up a new admin account, effectively taking over the Ushahidi instance and gaining complete control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the Ushahidi application.
*   **Uninitialized Application:** The vulnerability is present when the application has not yet been initialized (e.g. the `database.php` file is missing or the application has not been fully configured), causing the redirect to the installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Ushahidi instance.
*   **Uninitialized Application State:** The attacker needs to target an instance of Ushahidi that is in an unconfigured state to trigger the installer.

This commit shows a fix that adds an `exit()` call after redirecting to the installer, which prevents the script from continuing execution and mitigates the vulnerability.
*   **[https://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_Web/commit/fcdad03](https://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_Web/commit/fcdad03)**
This commit contains another fix within the installer, adding `exit()` to prevent further execution after a redirect.
