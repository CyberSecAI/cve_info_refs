Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2012-3513:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `munin-cgi-graph` script in Munin, when running as a CGI module under Apache, incorrectly handles command-line arguments passed through the query string. Specifically, it processes the query string as command-line arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Handling:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the query string before using it as command-line parameters. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
- **Configuration Manipulation:** A malicious user could manipulate the `logdir` option in the `munin-cgi-graph` configuration by inserting the `logdir` command via a crafted query string in a web request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Creation:** By manipulating the `logdir` option, an attacker can create arbitrary files and directories on the server, with the privileges of the webserver user.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, the Debian bug report mentions that `munin` attempts to open a file with a `.storable` extension using Perl's `Storable` module. While not confirmed to be an exploit vector, this could potentially lead to code execution, similar to Python's pickle vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests.
- **CGI Script:** The vulnerability is specific to setups where `munin-cgi-graph` is used as a CGI script under Apache, rather than FastCGI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `munin-cgi-graph` script.
- No specific authentication is required, as the vulnerability is exploited through the query string, which is publicly accessible.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the `munin-cgi-graph` configuration options.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Munin version 2.0.6, where the `munin-cgi-graph` script is modified to ignore command-line arguments from `@ARGV`.
- The vulnerability is specific to setups where `munin-cgi-graph` is deployed as a CGI script under Apache, and not when running as FastCGI.
- The vulnerability only affected Ubuntu 12.10.
- The vulnerability was found by Stevie Trujillo.
