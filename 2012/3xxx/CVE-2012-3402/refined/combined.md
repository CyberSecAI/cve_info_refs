| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-10 13:28:05 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Adobe Photoshop(tm) PSD plug-in of Gimp, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, performed decoding of headers, when loading certain Adobe Photoshop image files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened in Gimp would lead to PSD plug-in crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gimp executable.  This issue was found by Jan Lieskovsky of the Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-11 15:52:27 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-3402](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3402) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c4)  Nils Philippsen    2012-08-08 15:35:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 603059](attachment.cgi?id=603059&action=diff "Patch to fix CVEs 2009-3909 and 2012-3402") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=603059&action=edit "Patch to fix CVEs 2009-3909 and 2012-3402") Patch to fix CVEs 2009-3909 and 2012-3402   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-20 13:45:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1181 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1181.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-10 13:28:05 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Adobe Photoshop(tm) PSD plug-in of Gimp, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, performed decoding of headers, when loading certain Adobe Photoshop image files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened in Gimp would lead to PSD plug-in crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gimp executable.  This issue was found by Jan Lieskovsky of the Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-11 15:52:27 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-3402](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3402) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c4)  Nils Philippsen    2012-08-08 15:35:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 603059](attachment.cgi?id=603059&action=diff "Patch to fix CVEs 2009-3909 and 2012-3402") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=603059&action=edit "Patch to fix CVEs 2009-3909 and 2012-3402") Patch to fix CVEs 2009-3909 and 2012-3402   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-20 13:45:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1181 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1181.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Subject: The Gimp PSD plug-in CVE-2012-3402 issue

Hello vendors,

  see below report about the GIMP's PSD plug-in CVE-2012-3402 issue:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary: Gimp (PSD plug-in): Heap-buffer overflow by decoding certain PSD headers

CVE: CVE-2012-3402

Description:
A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Adobe Photoshop(tm) PSD plug-in
of Gimp, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, performed decoding of headers, when loading
certain Adobe Photoshop image files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
PSD image file that, when opened in Gimp would lead to PSD plug-in crash or, potentially,
arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gimp executable.

Note: A different flaw than CVE-2009-3909.

CVSSv2: 6.8/AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

Affected versions: X <= 2.2.13
                   Newer versions (gimp-v2.6.X, gimp-v2.8.X, master) are not affected
                   by this issue.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1181)

## Topic

Updated gimp packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and
editing program.

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
were found in the GIMP's Adobe Photoshop (PSD) image file plug-in. An
attacker could create a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened,
could cause the PSD plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2009-3909,
CVE-2012-3402)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the GIMP's GIF image format plug-in. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted GIF image file that, when opened, could cause the GIF
plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3481)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)
decompression algorithm implementation used by the GIMP's GIF image format
plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted GIF image file that,
when opened, could cause the GIF plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP.
(CVE-2011-2896)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's KiSS CEL file
format plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted KiSS palette
file that, when opened, could cause the CEL plug-in to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3403)

Red Hat would like to thank Secunia Research for reporting CVE-2009-3909,
