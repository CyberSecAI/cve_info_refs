  "CVE-2012-3402": {
    "Description": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Adobe Photoshop(tm) PSD plug-in of Gimp performed decoding of headers, when loading certain Adobe Photoshop image files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened in Gimp, would lead to a PSD plug-in crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gimp executable.",
    "Root cause": "Heap-based buffer overflow during decoding of PSD headers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "PSD plug-in crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the gimp executable.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially-crafted PSD image file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted PSD image file",
     "Affected versions": "X <= 2.2.13"
