Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in OpenStack Keystone when updating a user's default tenant. While the API would respond with a 401 "Not Authorized" error for unauthorized users attempting to change a user's default tenant, the user was still granted membership to the specified new tenant. This occurred because the authorization check was not performed before adding the user to the new tenant.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness is the insufficient authorization check when updating a user's default tenant via the administrative API.  The API was partially denying the request by not updating the default tenant, but incorrectly granting tenant membership.
- **Inconsistent API Response:** The API returned a 401 error, indicating lack of authorization, but still performed the action of adding the user to the tenant, creating an inconsistency between the API's stated and actual behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker, not authorized to modify user tenant assignments, could successfully add any user to any tenant within the OpenStack environment. This allows them to escalate their privileges by adding themselves to administrator tenants or grant others access to restricted resources.
- **Data Exposure:** By adding users to unauthorized tenants, an attacker could gain access to sensitive data within those tenants.
- **Compromised Infrastructure:** The ability to manipulate user-tenant assignments could potentially be used to disrupt services or compromise the integrity of the OpenStack environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Administrative API:** The attack vector is through the administrative API of OpenStack Keystone, typically deployed on port 35357.
- **HTTP PUT Request:** The specific vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted PUT request to the `/v2.0/users/{user_id}/tenant` endpoint of the admin API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the administrative API endpoint (port 35357 by default).
- **API Client:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP PUT requests to the administrative API.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability could be triggered even without proper authentication to the admin API, as the authorization check was flawed. However, the provided exploit example in the bug report shows the attacker was not using a valid X-Auth-Token for the request.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenStack Keystone versions in Essex and Folsom releases.
- Patches were released to address this vulnerability.
- The issue was initially reported by Dolph Mathews of Rackspace.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical".
- The fix was included in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS updates.

In summary, CVE-2012-3542 describes a critical authorization bypass in OpenStack Keystone's administrative API, enabling unauthorized users to add any user to any tenant, leading to potential privilege escalation and data exposure.
