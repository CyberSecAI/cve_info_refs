Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from an incorrect sequence of `onLocationChange` events during page transitions in the browser. Specifically, the `nsSecureBrowserUI::OnLocationChange` is fired before `XULBrowserWindow.onLocationChange`. This leads to a situation where the browser's security UI incorrectly displays SSL certificate information from the previous site, even after a new site has loaded. The `XULBrowserWindow.onSecurityChange` method early returns due to `_hostChanged` flag being false, which blocks UI updates. 

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect State Management:** The browser incorrectly manages the internal state related to location changes and security notifications, particularly the `_hostChanged` flag. The browser window, which acts as the sink for security change notifications, is notified *before* its host changed flag is set, so its security UI can miss updates.
*   **Race Condition:** A race condition exists in the order of calling  `OnLocationChange` and `OnSecurityChange` methods, which leads to inconsistent UI state.
*   **SSL UI Spoofing:**  The vulnerability leads to an incorrect display of SSL certificate information in the address bar. This shows certificate information from a previous website even after loading the new website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** The primary impact is the potential for successful phishing attacks. Attackers can lure users to malicious websites while the address bar displays the SSL information of a trusted website.
*   **User Deception:** Users can be deceived into believing they are interacting with a legitimate website, which may result in them entering sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Navigation:** The vulnerability is triggered by navigation between HTTPS websites. A user navigates from one https site to another. Specifically, the user loads a website, and then loads another https site from the history or manually entering the new address in the address bar
*   **Exploitation Steps:** The steps include loading a first webpage, then loading another webpage from history or through direct entry and after closing and reopening other tabs. This can cause the initial page's cert info to remain on the address bar after a new page is loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special privileges needed:** This is not a privilege escalation vulnerability and can be exploited by anyone who can navigate to the website.
*   **User interaction needed:** Exploitation requires the user to perform specific actions (navigating between specific sites).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report indicates that the regression was introduced by a fix for another bug ([Bug 745254](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=745254)).
*   The fix involves reverting the behavior to call `onSecurityChange` from both `STATE_STOP` and `STATE_DOCUMENT`.
*   The bug was fixed in Firefox 15, Firefox ESR 10.0.7, and SeaMonkey 2.12.
*   The vulnerability is also described in Ubuntu USN-1548-1 and SUSE-SU-2012:1167-1 security updates.
