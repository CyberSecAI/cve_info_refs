{
  "CVE-2012-3496": {
    "Description": "XENMEM_populate_physmap can be called with invalid flags. By calling it with MEMF_populate_on_demand flag set, a BUG can be triggered if a translating paging mode is not being used.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the MEMF_populate_on_demand flag within the XENMEM_populate_physmap hypercall when a translating paging mode is not in use.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Incorrect flag handling in hypercall"
     ],
    "Impact": "A malicious guest kernel can crash the host, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious guest kernel can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a paravirtualized guest kernel and have the ability to call hypercalls."
