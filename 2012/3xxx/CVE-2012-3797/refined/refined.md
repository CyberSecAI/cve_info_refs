Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2012-3797:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a lack of size checks on received packets. This allows an attacker to send a small packet and force the server to write its fields at memory locations beyond the allocated buffer, leading to heap corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Memory Corruption/Out-of-bounds write:** The server reuses input packet memory for modification and sending back, without validating the size of the packet. This allows writing beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory corruption:** Overwriting data on the heap, which can lead to unpredictable program behavior.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The memory corruption is likely to result in a system crash.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed, the document mentions that out-of-bounds memory access may lead to execution of arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted packets to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected Pro-face Pro-Server EX application or WinGP PC Runtime.
-   A moderate skill level is required to craft the exploit packets.
-   No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the server doesn't check the size of incoming packets. When a small packet is sent, and the server attempts to modify or send back, it writes beyond the allocated memory, corrupting the heap.
- The specific opcode `0x7 -> 0x14` triggers this vulnerability.
- The same vulnerability exists on both TCP and UDP ports for PCRuntime.exe
- The memory buffer is reused and fits the latest biggest packet, thus the attack is possible only if no bigger packets have been received previously.
- Public exploits for this vulnerability are available
- A patch has been released by Digital Electronics to mitigate the vulnerability.
