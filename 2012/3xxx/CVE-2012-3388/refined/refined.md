Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3388:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of cached user records in `lib/accesslib.php`. Specifically, the `is_enrolled` function was not correctly checking user capabilities after a user record had been cached.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Capability Checks:** Capability checks were not performed correctly for cached users, leading to a bypass of permission controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially bypass intended permission restrictions, gaining access to resources they should not be able to access.  The provided description indicates this is a "Minor" severity issue, suggesting it likely did not allow for full privilege escalation but likely provided access to sensitive data or functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Caching Mechanism:** The vulnerability is triggered by the caching mechanism for user records, meaning an attacker would likely exploit this through normal interaction with the system such that their user record gets cached.
- **Specific Function:** The issue is located in the `is_enrolled` function of `lib/accesslib.php`. This indicates that the attack would involve interacting with functionality that calls this function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker would likely need to be a valid, authenticated user on the system, as the issue arises from the caching of user data after the initial authentication.
- **Knowledge of System Functionality:**  An attacker may need to have knowledge of the system to specifically target the vulnerable function and caching mechanisms.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is identified as "MSA-12-0040" in the Moodle Security Advisories.
- The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 2.3 and 2.2 to 2.2.3+.
- The fix for this issue is linked to commit `a386e6e01792144ba53ae2ab257c0f014fc7b0e2`
