{
  "CVE-2012-3972": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `format-number` function of XSLT due to PR_dtoa returning a negative offset for the decimal position during conversion of very small numbers. The buffer overflow occurs during a check for a carry when formatting numbers.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Heap-buffer-overflow"
     ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability can lead to inaccurate formatting of numbers, information leakage, and potentially a crash of the application.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted XSLT stylesheet with a manipulated divisor or very small numbers. This can be done via a web page or an extension.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to control the XSLT stylesheet being processed, either by serving a malicious web page or by leveraging an affected extension.",
     "Additional Details": "The incorrect handling of the negative decimal offset causes a non-deterministic and inaccurate formatting of numbers. The out-of-bounds read was initially misidentified as a buffer overflow."
