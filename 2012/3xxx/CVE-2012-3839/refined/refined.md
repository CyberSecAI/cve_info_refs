      "description": "Multiple remote SQL Injection vulnerabilities are detected in the MyClientBase Content Management System v0.12. The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise. The vulnerability is located on invoice & tag when processing to request the invoice search module function of the content management system.",

The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action. The vulnerability is located on the username input fields first- or lastname & affects the user account listing on the admin section.",
