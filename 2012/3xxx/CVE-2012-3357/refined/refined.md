Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the SVN revision view in ViewVC handles log messages when a readable path is copied from an unreadable path.  Specifically, ViewVC improperly processes log messages in this scenario, leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of sensitive information from the log messages of copied paths that should otherwise be inaccessible.
- **Improper Access Control:** ViewVC fails to enforce access restrictions properly when dealing with copied paths, leading to the exposure of log messages from the source path to users who should not have access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information present within the log messages of the unreadable source path. This could include information about code changes, project details, passwords, or other confidential data committed to the repository.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of ViewVC when accessing SVN revision views.
- **Copied Paths:**  The attack requires the presence of a readable path copied from an unreadable path within the SVN repository.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to ViewVC:** Attackers need to have access to the ViewVC web interface.
- **Knowledge of SVN Structure:** Attackers need to know or discover a copied path where the source is unreadable and the destination is readable.
- **No Privilege Elevation:** This vulnerability doesn't provide any privilege escalation capabilities.
