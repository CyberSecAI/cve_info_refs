This means that a valid connection will be returned for an invalid credential.\n\n  This could also mean that, provided the correct subject, a datasource connection can be obtained that which might belong to a privileged user. A fix for this issue is already available up-stream. The up-stream fix is located at [jira [JBJCA-864](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBJCA-864)].\n"
