  "CVE-2012-3422": {
    "description": "Potential read from an uninitialized memory location",
    "root_cause": "An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in IcedTea-Web web browser plugin. The `get_cookie_info()` and `get_proxy_info()` call `getFirstInTableInstance()` with the `instance_to_id_map` hash as a parameter. If `instance_to_id_map` is empty, `getFirstInTableInstance()` returns an uninitialized pointer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of an uninitialized pointer"
    ],
    "impact": "Visiting a malicious web page could possibly cause a web browser using the IcedTea-Web plug-in to crash, disclose a portion of its memory, or execute arbitrary code.",
        "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page containing a specially crafted Java applet"
    ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or inject a malicious Java applet into a legitimate web page"

  "CVE-2012-3423": {
    "description": "Incorrect handling of not 0-terminated strings",
        "root_cause": "The IcedTea-Web plug-in incorrectly assumed all strings received from the browser were NUL terminated. When using the plug-in with a web browser that does not NUL terminate strings, visiting a web page containing a Java applet could lead to buffer over-read or over-write.",

      "Incorrect string handling",
            "Improper input validation"
    ],
