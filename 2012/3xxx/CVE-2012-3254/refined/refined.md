{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The iNodeMngChecker.exe component blindly copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack when handling the 0x0A0BF007 packet type.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM user privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based, sending a specially crafted 0x0A0BF007 packet to the iNodeMngChecker.exe service listening on TCP port 9090.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with network access to the vulnerable service. No authentication required."
