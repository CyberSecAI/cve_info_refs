Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from an insecure protocol redirection in the LDAP authentication process of Moodle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Protocol Redirection:** When a user is redirected after logging in via LDAP authentication, the system "forgets" the use of HTTPS and redirects the user to HTTP instead.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Downgrade to HTTP:**  The primary impact is that users are redirected from a secure HTTPS connection to an insecure HTTP connection after successful LDAP authentication. This exposes the user's session and potentially sensitive information to eavesdropping or tampering.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the insecure HTTP connection after the user is redirected, potentially compromising the user's session and accessing their information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LDAP Authentication and Redirection:** The attack vector is through the normal login process using LDAP authentication. After successful authentication, the system's redirect function does not maintain the HTTPS protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the server during the redirection from HTTPS to HTTP.
*   **Passive Eavesdropping/Active Interception:** The attacker could be passively eavesdropping on the network traffic or actively intercepting and modifying the traffic.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Moodle versions 2.3, 2.2 to 2.2.3+, 2.1 to 2.1.6+, and 2.0 to 2.0.9+ are affected.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description. It clearly outlines the vulnerable component (LDAP authentication), the specific issue (insecure protocol redirection), the impact (downgrade to HTTP), and the attack vector.
