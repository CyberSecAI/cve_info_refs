# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

## MGASA-2012-0316

| **Date:** | October 29th, 2012 |
| --- | --- |
| **Affected releases:** | 1, 2 |

**Description:**

Updated rpmdevtools package fixes security vulnerability:

A TOCTOU race condition was found in the way 'annotate-output' (used to

execute a program annotating the output linewise with time and stream) tool

of rpmdevtools before 8.3 performed management of its temporary files used

for standard output and standard error output. A local attacker could use

this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, possibly leading to their

ability in an unauthorized way to alter files belonging to the user running

the 'annotate-output' tool (CVE-2012-3500).

**Updated Packages:**

Mageia 1:

rpmdevtools-8.3-1.mga1

Mageia 2:

rpmdevtools-8.3-1.mga2

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our

CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2240 CVE-2012-2241 CVE-2012-2242 CVE-2012-3500

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in devscripts, a set of
scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier.
The following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ids have
been assigned to identify them:

CVE-2012-2240:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that dscverify does not perform
    sufficient validation and does not properly escape arguments to
    external commands, allowing a remote attacker (as when dscverify is
    used by dget) to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-2241:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that dget allows an attacker to delete
    arbitrary files when processing a specially-crafted .dsc or
    .changes file, due to insuficient input validation.

CVE-2012-2242:

    Raphael Geissert discovered that dget does not properly escape
    arguments to external commands when processing .dsc and .changes
    files, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    This issue is limited with the fix for CVE-2012-2241, and had
    already been fixed in version 2.10.73 due to changes to the code,
    without considering its security implications.

CVE-2012-3500:

    Jim Meyering, Red Hat, discovered that annotate-output determines
    the name of temporary named pipes in a way that allows a local
    attacker to make it abort, leading to denial of service.

Additionally, a regression in the exit code of debdiff introduced in
DSA-2409-1 has been fixed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.10.69+squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.12.3.

We recommend that you upgrade your devscripts packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-14 10:47:55 UTC  ``` A TOCTOU race condition was found in the way 'annotate-output' (used to execute a program annotating the output linewise with time and stream) tool of rpmdevtools, a suite of scripts and (X)Emacs support files to aid in development of RPM packages, performed management of its temporary files used for standard output and standard error output. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, possibly leading to their ability in an unauthorized way to alter files belonging to the user running the 'annotate-output' tool.

Following post clarifies that as the mkfifo is used to create temporary "files", this does not allow symlink attack and can at worst cause the script to exit early with an error.

The fix was applied in Fedora and hence should be included in future Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.  There's no plan to fix this issue as a security flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ``` |  |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [devscripts](/security/cves?package=devscripts) - scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier

## Details

Raphael Geissert discovered that the debdiff.pl tool incorrectly handled

shell metacharacters. If a user or automated system were tricked into

processing a specially crafted filename, a remote attacher could possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-0212](/security/CVE-2012-0212))

Raphael Geissert discovered that the dscverify tool incorrectly escaped

arguments to external commands. If a user or automated system were tricked

into processing specially crafted files, a remote attacher could possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-2240](/security/CVE-2012-2240))

Raphael Geissert discovered that the dget tool incorrectly performed input

validation. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing

specially crafted files, a remote attacher could delete arbitrary files.

([CVE-2012-2241](/security/CVE-2012-2241))

Raphael Geissert discovered that the dget tool incorrectly escaped

arguments to external commands. If a user or automated system were tricked

into processing specially crafted files, a remote attacher could possibly

execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and

Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2012-2242](/security/CVE-2012-2242))

Jim Meyering discovered that the annotate-output tool incorrectly handled

temporary files. A local attacker could use this flaw to alter files being

processed by the annotate-output tool. On Ubuntu 11.04 and later, this

issue was mitigated by the Yama kernel symlink restrictions.

([CVE-2012-3500](/security/CVE-2012-3500))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-14 10:47:55 UTC  ``` A TOCTOU race condition was found in the way 'annotate-output' (used to execute a program annotating the output linewise with time and stream) tool of rpmdevtools, a suite of scripts and (X)Emacs support files to aid in development of RPM packages, performed management of its temporary files used for standard output and standard error output. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, possibly leading to their ability in an unauthorized way to alter files belonging to the user running the 'annotate-output' tool.   Issue found by Jim Meyering of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-14 10:50:32 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of the rpmdevtools package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the rpmdevtools package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16 and 17.  --  This issue did NOT affect the version of the rpmdevtools package, as shipped with Fedora EPEL 5 as it did not include support for 'annotate-output' tool yet.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-14 10:52:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 604260](attachment.cgi?id=604260&action=diff "Proposed patch by Jim Meyering to fix CVE-2012-3500") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=604260&action=edit "Proposed patch by Jim Meyering to fix CVE-2012-3500") Proposed patch by Jim Meyering to fix [CVE-2012-3500](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3500)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-16 15:12:24 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-3500](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3500) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-31 15:11:46 UTC  ``` Created rpmdevtools tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 853452](show_bug.cgi?id=853452 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-3500 rpmdevtools: TOCTOU race condition in annotate-output [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2012-09-20 13:27:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c0))  > A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, possibly > leading to their ability in an unauthorized way to alter files belonging to the > user running the 'annotate-output' tool.  Following post clarifies that as the mkfifo is used to create temporary "files", this does not allow symlink attack and can at worst cause the script to exit early with an error.  [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/8277/focus=8286](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/8277/focus%3D8286)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2012-11-15 15:42:42 UTC  ``` Closing as not-a-security-bug based on the information in [comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=848022#c8).  The fix was applied in Fedora and hence should be included in future Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.  There's no plan to fix this issue as a security flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
