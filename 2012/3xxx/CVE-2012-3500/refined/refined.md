{
  "CVE-2012-3500": {
    "Description": "A TOCTOU race condition was found in the way 'annotate-output' (used to execute a program annotating the output linewise with time and stream) tool of rpmdevtools before 8.3 performed management of its temporary files used for standard output and standard error output. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks, possibly leading to their ability in an unauthorized way to alter files belonging to the user running the 'annotate-output' tool.",
    "Root cause": "TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race condition in the handling of temporary files by the 'annotate-output' tool.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "TOCTOU race condition",
      "Insecure temporary file handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could potentially alter files belonging to the user running the `annotate-output` tool.",
        "Attack vectors": [
      "Local exploitation",
      "Symbolic link attack"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system and the ability to create symbolic links."
