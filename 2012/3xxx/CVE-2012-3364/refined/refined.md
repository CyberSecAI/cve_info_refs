The provided content relates to CVE-2012-3364.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The NCI (Near Field Communication Controller Interface) code in the Linux kernel was not properly validating length fields from incoming frames, leading to buffer overflows.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Multiple remotely exploitable stack-based buffer overflows due to missing boundary checks on length fields from incoming frames. Data was being copied into statically-sized arrays without verifying the length of the incoming data.

Impact of exploitation:
A remote attacker could potentially crash the system or execute privileged code by exploiting these buffer overflows.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted NFC frames with malicious length fields. The attack is remote and does not require local access to the system.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
A remote attacker capable of sending specially crafted NFC frames. No local access or specific privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
