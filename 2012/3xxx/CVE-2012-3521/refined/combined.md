Hi,

Were these reports of security issues supposed to be genuine?

Or was this simply your "idea on how to get them to update GeSHi". [1]

You refer to vulnerabilities in unspecified "contrib" scripts, but it
seems to me that Debian does not even ship them in the php-geshi package.

"Debian who STILL believes the most recent version is 1.0.8.4", actually
identifies the latest version as 1.0.8.10 on the PTS [2], with a link to
the source tarball, and that will surely update within a few hours to
indicate the new 1.0.8.11 release.

Yes, you already filed a wishlist bug asking for someone to package the
new version, so there was no reason to file a new 'serious'-severity
duplicate just now demanding the same.

It seems to me you are in fact wasting the time of whoever would
potentially package your software, of developers busy fixing serious
issues to make the next Debian release happen, and of the security team,
who would be kindly looking after users for the package's 2-3 year term
in stable/oldstable.

Some users really prefer long-term, unchanging versions, because they
deploy lots of software that they don't want to have to review for
what's changed, update it, re-test and check compatibility on a regular
basis.  Debian's stable distribution fulfills that need.

The freeze deadline has already passed, for someone to have
_volunteered_ to update the GeSHi package in time for the Wheezy release
process.  The only exception now might be for a genuine security fix or
serious flaw (which would probably be only a minimal patch for the
specific issue),

It is possible for more frequent updates to be packaged in testing or
backports, for example to support new programming languages, but it
would require continued effort on the part of a volunteer maintainer.
That person would have had to process your bug reports too.

With the freeze this is no longer possible. If this is indeed
a security issue, we can either apply a backported fix or have
the package removed from the release, at this point in time.

Well, no. But it'd be a bit long for this mail to shed light on all the
background. And since I don't want to bore you to death while you
actually could be doing something useful (like e.g. updating the
package) I refrain from doing so.

Debian ships them. And the Security Team already has been notified about
the details. That's also the reason why these two bugs have been made
public as part of a longer discussion yesterday.

Just checked [2]: Still says 1.0.8.10. But that wasn't the point of the
blog post: The point was about the packaging which was (and by the way
still is) way behind; but more on this in a moment.

There was a request on the #debian-qa channel when I talked to some
people directly asking for it. If you'd like the log just ask.

Oh, thanks for that compliment, but I've to decline. Given exactly the
2-3 years this package will be in stable/oldstable is the reason why
there should be an update to something reasonably recent before the
package is put into a distribution. Putting in a package which is
~40kLOCs in diffs behind the current version (to compare the core
component only is about 5kLOC) will be a monster to support. Last time
there was a report to fix something in a stable release took about 4
months of MY time to look up a patch that the Package maintainers
requested; it would have taken about 2 days using upstream AND testing
it thouroughly.

Yeah, no news to me. And BTW: I'm also using Debian on some of my systems.

And if you really want to try: GeSHi 1.0.7.15 (which should be around
etch IIRC) can be replaced by a current 1.0.8.11 and everything just
keeps working. That's aboutith Cygwin half my system breaks everytime I
install an update.

Feel lucky I had the revisions for the bugfix still at hand...

And regarding the packaging: It has been known for at least the time
there was this wishlist ticket that GeSHi was needing an update in
unstable/testing. It's absolutely not my fault that there's only someone
waking up once a security problem is notified. Also: I repeatedly tried
to get someone who was willing to do the packaging for php-geshi to
resolve those long-standing issues. If again the packaging team can't
manage to grant necessary privileges for about 5 month that's another
problem on your side.

Correct. And I already did some work on this part prior and in parallel
to these reports. So don't be as gentle as an elephant shopping for
procelain.

Hi Benny,

If I seem annoyed, it's because I was alerted about security issues in a
package deployed on one of my systems, and had to spend time looking
into it urgently.  (And I still don't know what the issues really are.)

All I could find out is that you've been insisting that Debian
distribute a new version of your software, that you had an "idea on how
to get them to update GeSHi", and that nothing from the contrib/
directory in the source is shipped in the php-geshi package anyway.

<http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/all/php-geshi/filelist>

So I'm still not sure what to make of this.

Regards,

tags 685324 = security upstream patch
thanks

Bug affects an example script in the documentation only.

Untrusted paths are used by file() and opendir().  A patch committed
upstream tries to sanitise the inputs. [1]

But these and other user-supplied data are still echoed out unescaped,
so I think would allow XSS if someone used the script on a public-facing
webserver.  The code looks like it might have all sorts of other issues.

It seems obsoleted by cssgen2.php, which does not need to accept user
input at all.  That is distributed already in php-geshi 1.0.8.4-1.

So I suggest removing the cssgen.php file altogether.  Thank you.

Sorry, it’s now too late for that. In May, something could have
been done, but not now. No new upstream versions, any more.

(That being said, updating it in sid now would be reasonable,
and wheezy users could just pull that package from sid.)

Thanks for this suggestion. I will prepare an upload that removes this file
from the examples directory and  will ask the release team for a freeze
exception.

If the change suggested above by Steven will be accepted by the release team
I will upload a new upstream version to unstable after the fixed version
migrated to testing.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

Thanks,

with his security hat on:

Dear release team,

I have an upload of geshi for Squeeze ready. The upload fixes #685324. The
upload was requested by Jonathan Wiltshire [1]. I attach a debdiff between
the version currently in Squeeze and my prepared update.
