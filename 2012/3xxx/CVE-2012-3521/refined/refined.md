Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3521:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `geshi-path` and `geshi-lang-path` HTTP GET/POST variables in the `cssgen` contrib module of GeSHi (a generic syntax highlighter). This module was designed to generate custom CSS files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The lack of proper sanitization allowed attackers to manipulate the path variables to access files and directories outside of the intended scope of the application.
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, attackers could potentially read the content of arbitrary local files accessible by the webserver's user privileges.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization**: The code used `file()` and `opendir()` on user-supplied data without proper validation.
- Additionally, user-supplied data was echoed without proper escaping, which could allow for XSS attacks although this was treated separately as CVE-2012-3522

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information stored on the server by reading local files.
- **Potential Server Compromise:** Depending on the server configuration and the sensitivity of the files accessible, this vulnerability could be a stepping stone to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP GET/POST requests.
- **Specially Crafted URLs:** Attackers would craft URLs containing malicious values in the `geshi-path` and `geshi-lang-path` parameters to exploit the directory traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability existed in the `cssgen.php` contrib script, not the core GeSHi functionality.
- The fix involved removing the vulnerable `cssgen.php` file and later it was replaced with `cssgen2.php` which does not take user input.
- The issue was addressed in GeSHi version 1.0.8.11 and patches were created by upstream developers.
