Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2012-3693:

**Vulnerability:**
- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how WebKit handles International Domain Names (IDN) and Unicode fonts. This allowed for the creation of URLs with look-alike characters.
- **Weakness:**  The vulnerability is a character spoofing issue, where characters visually similar to legitimate domain names could be used to create a deceptive URL.
- **Impact:** A malicious website could use a URL with look-alike characters to redirect the user to a spoofed site, visually appearing as a legitimate domain. This could potentially lead to phishing or other forms of social engineering attacks.
- **Attack Vector:**  A user visits a malicious website with a crafted URL. The user may be misled to believe that the website is legitimate.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create and host a website with a malicious URL containing look-alike characters. They also need to entice a user to visit that website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by supplementing WebKit's list of known look-alike characters.
- Look-alike characters are rendered in Punycode in the address bar after the fix, thus making the spoofing attempt less effective.
- This vulnerability affected both iOS and macOS.
- The vulnerability was reported by Matt Cooley of Symantec.
