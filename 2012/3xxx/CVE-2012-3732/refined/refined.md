- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The S/MIME signed messages displayed the untrusted 'From' address, instead of the name associated with the message signer's identity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Mail application displayed the untrusted 'From' address from a S/MIME signed message.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could spoof the sender of a S/MIME signed message by making the 'From' address appear as though it was from the actual signer.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector would involve sending a crafted S/MIME signed email message with a spoofed From address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send emails, and have the ability to create or modify S/MIME signed messages.
