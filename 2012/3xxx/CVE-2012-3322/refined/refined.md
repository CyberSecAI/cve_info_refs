The provided document discusses multiple vulnerabilities across various IBM products, including Maximo Asset Management, Tivoli Service Request Manager, and others. It mentions "XSS, Gain Privileges, Improper Access Control vulnerabilities" without specifying which CVE ID refers to which vulnerability. Since this document is a collection of security fixes and does not detail the exact vulnerabilities related to CVE-2012-3322, I am going to answer NOINFO as there is no detailed vulnerability information for the specific CVE.
