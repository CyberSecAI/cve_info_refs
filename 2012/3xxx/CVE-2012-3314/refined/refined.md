- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of XML signatures within Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) when handling certain single sign-on protocols and token modules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the inadequate validation of XML signatures. Specifically, TFIM fails to correctly identify and reject messages containing invalid or untrusted XML signatures.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can craft malicious messages that TFIM will mistakenly accept. This allows the attacker to potentially impersonate another user and perform actions on their behalf, gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted messages with invalid or untrusted XML signatures to the TFIM server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the TFIM server. They must also be able to craft XML messages with manipulated signatures, which implies knowledge of the XML signature format used by the targeted protocols.
