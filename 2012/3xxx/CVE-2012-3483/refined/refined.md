Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3483:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Race Condition (TOCTOU):** The vulnerability stems from a Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition. Specifically, there's a delay between when Tunnelblick's `openvpnstart` executable checks the permissions of a script file and when it actually executes that script as root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure File Permission Handling:** The `openvpnstart` program checks if a script has 744 permissions and is owned by root before executing it as root. This is insufficient because an attacker can exploit the time gap between the check and the execution.
*   **Missing atomic operation:** The check and execution of the file are not an atomic operation, opening a race condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Local Root Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local, unprivileged user to gain root privileges. The attacker can execute arbitrary code with root permissions by manipulating the script file during the race window.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker creates a malicious script file.
*   **Symlink manipulation:** The attacker can modify a symlink, targeting the vulnerable file, within the race window.
*   **Race Condition Exploitation:**  The attacker exploits the race condition by repeatedly changing the script file (e.g., through a symlink). The goal is to have the malicious script in place at the precise moment `openvpnstart` attempts to execute it after the permission check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have a regular user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to Create Files/Directories:** The attacker needs to be able to create directories and files in a location where they can be accessed by the vulnerable application.
*   **Ability to run `openvpnstart`:** The user needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable `openvpnstart` program.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
*   The content includes a proof-of-concept exploit (Pwnnel-Blicker) that demonstrates the race condition, creates the vulnerable directory structure, manipulates symlinks, and triggers `openvpnstart`.
*   The exploit uses a loop to repeatedly create/remove symlinks, taking advantage of the race window.
*   The vulnerability specifically affects Tunnelblick's `openvpnstart` executable on macOS.
*   The exploit writes a pid file for tracking purposes and can be triggered multiple times. The first run sets up the exploit, and subsequent runs achieve root privilege.
*  The exploit is written in C and has a set of clear steps to reproduce the issue.
