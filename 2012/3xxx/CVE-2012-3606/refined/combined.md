## Safari 6.0.1

**Note**: For OS X Mountain Lion systems, Safari 6.0.1 is included with OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2.

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted downloaded HTML document may lead to the disclosure of local file content

  Description: In OS X Mountain Lion HTML files were removed from the unsafe type list. Quarantined HTML documents are opened in a safe mode that prevents accessing other local or remote resources. A logic error in Safari's handling of the Quarantine attribute caused the safe mode not to be triggered on Quarantined files. This issue was addressed by properly detecting the existence of the Quarantine attribute.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-3713 : Aaron Sigel of vtty.com, Masahiro Yamada

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1

  Impact: Using Autofill on a maliciously crafted website may lead to the disclosure of contact information

  Description: A rare condition existed in the handling of Form Autofill. Using Form Autofill on a maliciously crafted website may have led to disclosure of information from the Address Book "Me" card that was not included in the Autofill popover. This issue was addressed by limiting Autofill to the fields contained in the popover.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-3714 : Jonathan Hogervorst of Buzzera

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1

  Impact: After editing a HTTPS URL in the address bar, a request may be unexpectedly sent over HTTP

  Description: A logic issue existed in the handling of HTTPS URLs in the address bar. If a portion of the address was edited by pasting text, the request may be unexpectedly sent over HTTP. This issue was addressed by improved handling of HTTPS URLs.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-3715 : Aaron Rhoads of East Watch Services LLC, Pepi Zawodsky

* **WebKit**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple memory corruption issues existed in WebKit. These issues were addressed through improved memory handling.

# About the security content of iOS 6.1 Software Update

This document describes the security content of iOS 6.1.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see [How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620).

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

## iOS 6.1

* **Identity Services**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Authentication relying on certificate-based Apple ID authentication may be bypassed

  Description: An error handling issue existed in Identity Services. If the user's AppleID certificate failed to validate, the user's AppleID was assumed to be the empty string. If multiple systems belonging to different users enter this state, applications relying on this identity determination may erroneously extend trust. This issue was addressed by ensuring that NULL is returned instead of an empty string.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0963

* **International Components for Unicode**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A canonicalization issue existed in the handling of the EUC-JP encoding, which could lead to a cross-site scripting attack on EUC-JP encoded websites. This issue was addressed by updating the EUC-JP mapping table.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3058 : Masato Kinugawa

* **Kernel**
