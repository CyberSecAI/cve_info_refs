      "description": "The provided content includes information about CVE-2012-3993, specifically related to XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) in Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause is that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error wrapped in a COW that does not specify exposed properties. An attacker could add these properties, leading to access to chrome privileged functions through script. Additionally, COW did not disallow access to properties from standard prototypes in some situations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of Chrome Object Wrappers (COW).",
        "Failure to properly specify exposed properties on Error objects wrapped in COW.",
        "Bypassing security checks when accessing properties of cross-origin objects.",
        "XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW."
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or arbitrary code execution within the context of the application (Firefox, Thunderbird). This would allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying page content, stealing confidential data, or executing arbitrary code with user privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Tricking a user into opening a malicious web page.",
        "Exploiting the failure of InstallTrigger to create an error wrapped in a COW with insufficient security restrictions.",
         "Exploiting flaws in ChromeObjectWrapper's handling of standard prototypes."

      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to inject script into a vulnerable context, such as a browser environment.",
