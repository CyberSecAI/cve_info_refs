I think this is a problem with the teTeX configuration; however, I am not that smart on setting up teTeX.  I just use it.  With RH 5.1, it just worked.  With 5.2 it doesn't work...   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=86#c1)  Preston Brown    1998-11-23 16:18:59 UTC  ``` this one's for you, Cristian.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=86#c2)  Cristian Gafton    1998-12-05 17:31:59 UTC  ``` *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [119](show_bug.cgi?id=119 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - latex no longer compiles some files it did in RH 5.1") ***   ``` |  |

An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

dropdown menu can be used for URL spoofing, other evil
Firefox 10.0.1 : Navigation away from a page with
multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*
CVE-2012-3995: Out of bounds read in
IsCSSWordSpacingSpace
\*
CVE-2012-4179: Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn
\*
CVE-2012-4180: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace
\*
CVE-2012-4181: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILAnimationController::DoSample
\*
CVE-2012-4182: Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditRules::WillInsert
\*
CVE-2012-4183: Heap-use-after-free in
DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures
\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-4185: Global-buffer-overflow in
nsCharTraits::length
\*
CVE-2012-4186: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData
\*
CVE-2012-4187: Crash with ASSERTION: insPos too small
\*
CVE-2012-4188: Heap-buffer-overflow in Convolve3x3
\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-83

## Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) does not disallow access to privileged functions or properties

Announced
October 9, 2012
Reporter
Mariusz Mlynski
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 16
* Firefox ESR 10.0.8
* SeaMonkey 2.13
* Thunderbird 16
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.8

### Description

Security researcher **Mariusz Mlynski** reported that when
InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper
(COW) that fails to specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome privileged functions
through script.

While investigating this issue, Mozilla security researcher
**moz\_bug\_r\_a4** found that COW did not disallow accessing of
properties from a standard prototype in some situations, even when the original
issue had been fixed.

These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or arbitrary
code execution.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

After [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype") landing, content still can access properties of a standard prototype from a chrome scope if \_\_exposedProps\_\_ doesn't exist.
67 ChromeObjectWrapper::get(JSContext \*cx, JSObject \*wrapper, JSObject \*receiver,
68 jsid id, js::Value \*vp)
69 {
70 // Try the lookup on the base wrapper.
71 if (!ChromeObjectWrapperBase::get(cx, wrapper, receiver, id, vp))
72 return false;
73
74 // If we found something or have no proto, we're done.
75 JSObject \*wrapperProto = JS\_GetPrototype(wrapper);
76 if (!vp->isUndefined() || !wrapperProto)
77 return true;
ChromeObjectWrapperBase::get lookups the chrome object's prototype chain and can find something on a standard prototype from the chrome scope.

[testcase 2 - XrayWrapper pollution](attachment.cgi?id=648980)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=648980&action=edit)

This does a similar thing to what the testcase in [bug 768101 comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=768101#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW") does.
This works on fx14-17 but does not work on fx10.

Ah, crap.
The code isn't broken per se, but the issue that moz\_bug\_r\_a4 pointed out means that I was mistaken to suggest it as a solution to [bug 768101](/show_bug.cgi?id=768101 "VERIFIED FIXED - XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW"). It will do the right thing once \_\_exposedProps\_\_ starts being mandatory, but that's only going to happen this cycle.
In order to get the behavior I was imagining, we'll need [bug 778085](/show_bug.cgi?id=778085 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement getPrototype proxy trap"), which offloads the duties of ChromeObjectWrapper into the JS engine and lets us remove ChromeObjectWrapper.{cpp,h} entirely. Those patches will be landing on m-i tomorrow probably once Eddy and I work out a few details.

Tracking this bug for 15, though we are going to final beta now, but if there is a chemspill we can look at taking this along. Also tracking ? for ESR until this lands and we can approve for the appropriate ESR at the time. This is the rest of the work started/landed in [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype").

Is it worth adding an Object.prototype.bar in the sandbox and ensuring that the Object.prototype being used is the sandbox's?

Yeah, this is pretty ugly. One way to fix it would be to expose the guts of BaseProxyHandler::get as a protected function that takes a JSPropertyDescriptor and gets the value using it. For now, I think this is fine, since the double protochain walk isn't detectable (and should be fast enough anyway). If we end up allowing \_\_exposedProps\_\_ on objects on the proto chain though, it might be worth it to clean this up.

Part 2 - Remap objects from standard prototypes even if they're explicitly exposed. v2
Back from vacation. Looks like this stuck on m-c (which has now also branched to m-a), so it's time to get this onto beta and esr10.
This patch isn't super risky. The bulk of the work happened over in [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype"), which has now landed everywhere. This just tweaks it a bit. No string or IID changes.

## Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others

discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3982](/security/CVE-2012-3982), [CVE-2012-3983](/security/CVE-2012-3983), [CVE-2012-3988](/security/CVE-2012-3988), [CVE-2012-3989](/security/CVE-2012-3989),

[CVE-2012-4191](/security/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always

properly handle the  element. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.

([CVE-2012-3984](/security/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the

HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](/security/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform

security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](/security/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be

bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-3991](/security/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a

remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject

script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](/security/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that

allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-3993](/security/CVE-2012-3993), [CVE-2012-3994](/security/CVE-2012-3994), [CVE-2012-4184](/security/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in

Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker

could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context

of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3990](/security/CVE-2012-3990), [CVE-2012-3995](/security/CVE-2012-3995), [CVE-2012-4179](/security/CVE-2012-4179), [CVE-2012-4180](/security/CVE-2012-4180),

[CVE-2012-4181](/security/CVE-2012-4181), [CVE-2012-4182](/security/CVE-2012-4182), [CVE-2012-4183](/security/CVE-2012-4183), [CVE-2012-4185](/security/CVE-2012-4185), [CVE-2012-4186](/security/CVE-2012-4186),

[CVE-2012-4187](/security/CVE-2012-4187), [CVE-2012-4188](/security/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location

object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability

to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4192](/security/CVE-2012-4192), [CVE-2012-4193](/security/CVE-2012-4193))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=863623#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-06 05:19:00 UTC  ``` Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome privileged functions through script.  While investigating this issue, Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 found that COW did not disallow accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.  These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

## Synopsis

Critical: thunderbird security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1351)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3982,
CVE-2012-3988, CVE-2012-3990, CVE-2012-3995, CVE-2012-4179, CVE-2012-4180,
CVE-2012-4181, CVE-2012-4182, CVE-2012-4183, CVE-2012-4185, CVE-2012-4186,
CVE-2012-4187, CVE-2012-4188)

Two flaws in Thunderbird could allow malicious content to bypass intended
restrictions, possibly leading to information disclosure, or Thunderbird
executing arbitrary code. Note that the information disclosure issue could
possibly be combined with other flaws to achieve arbitrary code execution.
(CVE-2012-3986, CVE-2012-3991)

Multiple flaws were found in the location object implementation in
Thunderbird. Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site
scripting attacks, script injection, or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2012-1956,
CVE-2012-3992, CVE-2012-3994)

Two flaws were found in the way Chrome Object Wrappers were implemented.
Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site scripting attacks or
cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-3993, CVE-2012-4184)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Soroush Dalili,
miaubiz, Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen, Johnny Stenback, Alice White,
moz\_bug\_r\_a4, and Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporters of these
issues.

Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.8 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

[Proof of concept](attachment.cgi?id=636392)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=636392&action=edit)

When InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper. It doesn't specify |\_\_exposedProps\_\_|, so it's unsafe by default. An attacker may append custom-tailored |\_\_exposedProps\_\_| at the bottom of the error's prototype chain (in Object.prototype), thus exposing privileged functions of Object or Function. Function seems to be guarded well (it throws "Not allowed to access chrome eval or Function from content"), but Object has things like defineProperty or \_\_defineGetter\_\_, and they can be exploited to pollute the XrayWrapper of the content window.

Sigh, it sure would have been nice if people would have let me land [bug 553102](/show_bug.cgi?id=553102 "RESOLVED FIXED - Flip __exposedProps__ default for non-WN objects to default-safe") when I tried to back in May.
Anyway, that's the real fix here - everything else is just whack-a-mole. But it might be a game of whack-a-mole that we have to play.
Here's where the error is being thrown:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/extensions/content/extensions-content.js#68>
I think the sanest thing to do here in the interim is to special-case exception objects and make them default to deny.

Oh right - but this is actually pulling the stuff off Object.prototype. Maybe we'll have to special-case that as well.

Hm, I guess this might as well be time to fix [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype").
Rather than trying to plug holes all the way up the prototype chain, I think it makes more sense for COW wrapping to detect if the proto of the wrapped object is a standard class, and if so, use the corresponding proto from the wrapper's compartment rather than the wrapped proto from the wrappee's compartment. This plugs the hole in the bug here, and also paves the way for a possible solution over in [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype"): when the COW access check fails, we can just punt to our prototype and do the lookup there.
The easiest way to do this seems to be to add another wrapping callback to allow a custom prototype.
One thing we would need would be a way to detect whether an object is a proto from a standard class. We can currently locate such protos from the global (JSProto\_Object etc), but I don't see any way to go the other direction.
Luke, is there such a way? Or could we add one?

I'm almost finished with a set of patches for [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype") that fix this bug as a side effect. As such I'm going to use that bug as the primary vehicle, since it allows development to happen in the open, and since it gives us a plausible story for why we need to backport (making life more sensible for the addon developers who will be hit by the \_\_exposedProps\_\_ warning).

Attached file
[Local file theft demo using polluted Xrays (CRASHES)](attachment.cgi?id=638513)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=638513&action=edit)

I wanted to see how far I could go with overwritten Xrays without relying on add-ons or user interaction, and ended up with a local file theft demo. Here it is for the record, it forces a crash after a while and tries to get "C:\secret.txt" after the restart.

Attached patch

[Imply empty \_\_exposedProps\_\_ for Error objects. v1](attachment.cgi?id=638693&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=638693&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=768101&attachment=638693)

This is a small fix that \_might\_ be helpful in general, but doesn't fix the bug at hand. I'm leaning against landing it, since trunk will be fixed soon anyway (when we make \_\_exposedProps\_\_ mandatory), and would only be useful if chrome stuck custom properties on exceptions it threw (which is unlikely).

A fix "soon" on trunk doesn't ship for 3-4 months, and doesn't help us on ESR at all. Any other options?Assignee: nobody → bobbyholley+bmo

Perhaps I wasn't clear. I was referring to the patch in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=768101#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW"), which doesn't fix any known security bug, but was motivated by this testcase. It's tangential, and I just uploaded it for posterity. You can ignore it.
The actual fix for this bug lives in [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype"). When it gets review, we can move forward.

I can't reproduce the testcases I posted in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=768101#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW") and [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=768101#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW"), the chrome objects such as Object or Function can't be accessed from the proto chain lookup anymore. However, the fix to [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype") is partially flawed -- the property lookup is not properly redirected to the local prototype chain. Thus, the inherited properties on COW come from the chrome counterparts of the objects in the prototype chain. Should I file a new bug for it?

Yeah, moz\_bug\_r\_a4 filed this as [bug 780370](/show_bug.cgi?id=780370 "RESOLVED FIXED - ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented as intended").
The patches as-landed are correct in their intended purpose, but I was incorrect in my assessment that they would fix this bug. I believe we need the patches in [bug 778085](/show_bug.cgi?id=778085 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement getPrototype proxy trap") and [bug 778086](/show_bug.cgi?id=778086 "RESOLVED INACTIVE - Reimplement ChromeObjectWrapper with getPrototype proxy hook"), which I'll try to get landed on m-c today assuming that Eddy is around.

Imply empty \_\_exposedProps\_\_ for Error objects. v1
Gah. So per [bug 780370](/show_bug.cgi?id=780370 "RESOLVED FIXED - ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented as intended"), the fix that we backported in [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype") is circumvented because Error objects don't have \_\_exposedProps\_\_.
This patch I uploaded here wasn't useful before (because callers could just do Object.getPrototypeOf and walk around the Error object). But now, this patch will plug the hole in a whack-a-mole sort of way. So maybe we should land this on m-a and m-b? It's only effective if there are no other ways that content can get its hands on a chrome object without \_\_exposedProps\_\_. I'm not sure how reasonable of an assumption that is. Blake?

Should be fixed by those two, I believe.

Try to use Nightlies corresponding to dates when PoC's were posted. For example, local file theft demo v1 was posted on 2012-07-02, and it won't work with a 2012-07-30 build, because [bug 760109](/show_bug.cgi?id=760109 "RESOLVED FIXED - Make __exposedProps__ more aware of the prototype") had been landed on 2012-07-28 and the bug I used to crash the browser was also fixed in the meantime.
To test the local file theft demos, simply open the page and wait. The browser will crash when session store collects form data, which is done periodically and may take anywhere from 1 to 20 seconds to happen. When the crash reporter window appears, click "Restart Firefox". If the browser doesn't crash for some reason, check the error console to see if there've been any errors -- if not, kill the browser manually.
The demos force the browser to fill the file input box with "C:\\secret.txt" -- this is a Windows path, so you may want to adjust it for your OS by opening the html file in a text editor, replacing this string with whatever references a file on your system, and saving the file.

Thanks Mariusz, with the first PoC and the Firefox 16.0a1 2012-06-25 build I get a very big context menu when I right click. Is this the effect of the PoC? In other words, a fixed build should not show the context menu?

I first get an alert dialog saying "called" and then a big context menu as you described. A fixed build should not pop up the alert dialog and should display a normal context menu. I have no idea why you're not getting an alert dialog, perhaps the context menu immediately cancels the dialog on systems other than Windows? Anyway, that test was merely to show that the browser operates on a polluted XrayWrapper, and if the context menu doesn't look normal, that's an effect of calling bogus getSelection.

Sorry, I forgot to mention the alert dialog was showing before the context menu. In other words:
1. Load PoC testcase
2. Right click

3. Click OK

I managed to get the first local file demo to work by changing C:\\secret.txt to /home/ashughes/Downloads/foo.txt but the second local file demo does not work with the same change. Note, I used Firefox 16.0a1 2012-07-02 for testcase 1, Firefox 17.0a1 2012-08-08 for testcase 2.
Anything you can advise Mariusz?

> Anything you can advise Mariusz?
"Does not work" is a little vague. :-)
It doesn't crash? Wait 20 seconds, open the web console (Ctrl+Shift+K), type node and press enter. If it returns an input element, that means your browser somehow made it through the crash function -- kill it manually from the task manager and restart. If it returns undefined, I'm not sure what happens -- check the Error console (Ctrl+Shift+J).
It crashes, but the input box isn't filled on restart? You could try replacing |setTimeout('crash()',1000);| with |setTimeout('alert(1)',1000);| -- when the alert box appears, check the Error console. You could also try to open sessionstore.js located in your profile folder and search for the path you specified to see if it's been injected properly.
For the record, I've rechecked the second file theft demo in Firefox 17.0a1 2012-08-08 Win32 and it WFM.

1. Loaded testcase v2
2. Waited a minute
> No crash
3. Opened webconsole and typed "node" then pressed enter
> Returned [object HTMLInputElement @ 0x3d05490 (native @ 0x52bfd60)]
4. Killed the process and restarted Firefox
> Empty alert box appears
5. Dismiss the alert box
> Input box has the text
I get the following in error console:
Error: Exposing chrome JS objects to content without \_\_exposedProps\_\_ is insecure and deprecated. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPConnect_wrappers> for more information.
Source File: file:///home/ashughes/Downloads/file-theft-demo2.htm
Line: 24
I see the following in my sessionstore.js:
{"url":"file:///home/ashughes/Downloads/file-theft-demo2.htm","ID":3,"docshellID":6,"docIdentifier":3,"formdata":{"id":{"foo":{"type":"file","fileList":["/home/ashughes/Downloads/foo.txt"]}},"xpath":{}},"scroll":"0,0"}]
No crash though...
Again, using Firefox 17.0a2 2012-08-08 debug.

OK, so the only thing that failed was the crash routine. I guess the vector I used is OS-specific. The crucial elements worked as expected, ie. the polluted function was called, the file path was injected into sessionstore.js and then "restored" after a restart. You can call it verified if you can't reproduce this behaviour in the latest Nightly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
