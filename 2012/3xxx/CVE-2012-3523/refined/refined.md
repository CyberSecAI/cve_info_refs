Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a "starttls command injection issue" in the `inn` (InterNetNews) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability allows for command injection through the `starttls` command, indicating a lack of proper input sanitization or validation in how the command is handled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided content does not specify the exact impact of a successful command injection. However, command injection vulnerabilities can often lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `starttls` command, which suggests the attack vector is through a network connection to a service using the `inn` software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the vulnerable service to exploit the vulnerability. This suggests the attacker would either need to be on the same network as the vulnerable service, or be able to reach it over the internet. They would also need to craft a malicious `starttls` command to perform the injection.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple openSUSE versions including 12.2, 12.1, and 11.4.
- Patches were released to correct the vulnerability.
- The specific patch for all affected versions of openSUSE is `openSUSE-2012-600`.
- The fix is included in `inn` versions 2.5.2-12.5.1 for openSUSE 12.2, 2.5.2-9.4.1 for openSUSE 12.1, and 2.5.2-9.1 for openSUSE 11.4.
