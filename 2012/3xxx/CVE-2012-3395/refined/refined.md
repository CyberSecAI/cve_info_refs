Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Feedback module in Moodle was accepting form data without proper filtering. Specifically, the `data_submitted` parameter was being abused.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The lack of filtering on the `data_submitted` parameter in the Feedback module allows for the possibility of SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Serious" which indicates a significant potential impact.
- Successful SQL injection could allow an attacker to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (accessing sensitive information).
    - Data modification (altering existing data).
    - Unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
    - Denial of Service (by making the database unavailable or unresponsive)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Feedback module's form data submission. Specifically, the `data_submitted` parameter.
- An attacker could craft malicious input within the form data sent to the Feedback module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to submit data to the Feedback module.
- The attacker would need to be able to manipulate form data, specifically the `data_submitted` parameter, to inject SQL commands.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 2.2 to 2.2.3+, 2.1 to 2.1.6+, and 2.0 to 2.0.9+.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in the commit: `http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=9d8d2ee6192e8b7ebb6713bd6215e06f94e2a9f7&st=commit&s=MDL-27675`.
- The commit message states: "MDL-27675 - Feedback module abuses data_submitted"
- The fix involved sanitizing/filtering the `data_submitted` parameter to prevent SQL injection.
