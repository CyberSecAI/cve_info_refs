Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to incorrect interrupt handling within VirtualBox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Incorrect interrupt handling in the Virtualbox x86 virtualization solution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote as indicated by "Problem type: remote" in the Debian security advisory. However, the Oracle advisory specifies the attack vector as "Local". The Debian advisory implies the attacker is external to the VM while the Oracle advisory suggests a local attacker within the guest OS is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   According to Debian, the attacker can be remote, suggesting that it might be possible to trigger the vulnerability from outside the virtual machine. The Oracle advisory indicates a local attacker within the virtual machine is required.
*   The Debian advisory states that the vulnerability is not Debian-specific, indicating that other systems running affected VirtualBox versions are vulnerable.
*   The Oracle document mentions that the vulnerability can only be exploited locally.
*   The Oracle document says this impacts Oracle VM Virtual Box versions 3.2, 4.0 and 4.1.
