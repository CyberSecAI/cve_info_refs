  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The sudo package's %postun script in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 created a temporary file insecurely. Specifically, there was a race condition between the removal of the temporary file and its re-creation using the `touch` command.",

      "Insecure temporary file creation",
      "Race condition vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit the race condition to create a symbolic link or the temporary file after it's been removed. This can lead to overwriting arbitrary files with contents of /etc/nsswitch.conf, or making the script create /etc/nsswitch.conf with attacker-controlled content and permissions.",
