| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=844442#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2012-07-30 16:15:32 UTC  ``` The sudo packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 contained a %postun script (executed during the package removal or upgrade) that created a temporary file insecurely.  The script did the following:  # Remove the "sudoers:" line from nsswitch.conf if it's not modified if grep -q "^sudoers: files ldap$" ""/etc/nsswitch.conf""; then    rm -f ""/var/tmp/nsswitch.conf.bak"" && \    touch ""/var/tmp/nsswitch.conf.bak"" && \    grep -v "^sudoers: files ldap$" ""/etc/nsswitch.conf"" > ""/var/tmp/nsswitch.conf.bak"" && \    mv -f ""/var/tmp/nsswitch.conf.bak"" ""/etc/nsswitch.conf"" fi  There was a race condition between the removal of the temporary file and its re-creation using touch.  A local attacker could possibly use this to create nsswitch.conf.bak file or symlink after rm -f "/var/tmp/nsswitch.conf.bak" was run and cause the script to overwrite arbitrary file with the contents of the /etc/nsswitch.conf file, or make the script create /etc/nsswitch.conf file with attacker controlled content and permissions.  The attack would have to be executed during the sudo package upgrade or removal.  This problem was introduced in the sudo erratum RHSA-2012:0309 which was released in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.8:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0309.html>  The sudo packages in other Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions did not include this %postun script and were not affected this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=844442#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-07 16:54:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1149 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1149.html>   ``` |  |

# Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

## Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin - July 2016

### Description

The Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle VM Server for x86 Security Advisories (OVMSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad](//linux.oracle.com/ovm-bulletin-pad)

### Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletin Schedule

Oracle VM Server for x86 Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017
* 18 April 2017
* 18 July 2017
