- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Traffic coming from remote virtual devices is incorrectly handled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of traffic from remote virtual devices.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who is capable of manipulating the traffic from a remote virtual device can crash the virtual machine.
- **Attack vectors**: Manipulating traffic from a remote virtual device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to manipulate the traffic from a remote virtual device. Users need administrative privileges on the virtual machine in order to attach remote devices. The attacker can leverage untrusted remote devices.
