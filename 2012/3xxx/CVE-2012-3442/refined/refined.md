Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-3442:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the redirect target's scheme in Django's `login()` and `logout()` views within the authentication framework. These views use a "POST-redirect-GET" pattern where a configurable querystring parameter specifies the redirect location after successful submission. The code validated the domain but not the URL scheme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of scheme validation allowed an attacker to craft a `data:` URL in the redirect target. This URL scheme can execute JavaScript when processed by a browser, potentially leading to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Attack:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web application. This can enable a range of malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker would create a specially crafted URL that contains a `data:` scheme redirect target.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on this malicious link, often through phishing or social engineering techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker must have the ability to create a URL with a malicious `data:` scheme redirect target.
- **Ability to Induce User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to click on the malicious link. This typically does not require access to the server or any special privilege.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text notes that some browsers, like Google Chrome, mitigate this by explicitly disallowing redirects to `data:` scheme URLs, but other major browsers do not.
- The fix involves subclassing Django's `HttpResponseRedirect` and `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect` and adding a whitelist of allowed URL schemes ('http', 'https', 'ftp'). Attempts to redirect to a non-whitelisted scheme now raise a `SuspiciousOperation` exception.
- The initial fix does not catch this exception in authentication views, meaning that site administrators will receive error reports when it is raised. Future releases will likely catch the exception.
