The provided content relates to CVE-2012-3006.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of insufficient entropy during the generation of RSA keys on embedded devices. Specifically, predictable "random" numbers are sometimes repeated or generated using weak methods, leading to both repeated keys and factorable keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Predictable Randomness:** Keys are generated using pseudorandom number generators seeded with predictable values, like the current time in seconds which could lead to multiple devices generating the same key.
2.  **Repeated Public Keys:**  Due to entropy issues, some devices generate identical public keys. This implies they also share the same private key and if one is compromised all devices with that key are also compromised.
3.  **Factorable Public Keys:** A vulnerability where moduli share a common prime factor (p), enabling an attacker to efficiently factor the keys by calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of pairs of moduli.  The addition of extra randomness between prime generation in OpenSSL, intended to increase security, can also contribute to this.
4.  **Default Certificates:** Many embedded devices use the same pre-installed default certificates across all devices of the same model.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Impersonation:** An attacker with a compromised private key can impersonate a legitimate web server to clients.
2.  **Traffic Decryption:** An attacker can decrypt encrypted traffic to and from a vulnerable device if they have obtained the private key.
3.  **Compromise of Multiple Devices:** In the case of repeated keys, compromising one device compromises all devices with the same key.
4.  **Large Scale Compromise:** The existence of factorable keys allows an attacker to potentially compromise a large number of devices using automated tools.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by scanning for and identifying vulnerable public keys.
2.  **GCD Calculation:** Attackers can factor keys by computing the GCD of pairs of RSA moduli, revealing the private key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to scan and retrieve public keys of vulnerable devices.
2.  **Computational Resources:** An attacker needs computational resources to perform GCD calculations.
3.  **Software Tools:** Attackers use tools like `nmap` and custom software to identify and factor vulnerable keys.

**Additional Details:**

*   The research identified that 1% of RSA keys in the SSL scans were repeated, and 0.4% were factorable.
*   The vulnerability primarily affects embedded devices like routers, firewalls, VPN devices, remote server administration tools, printers, projectors, and VOIP phones.
*   The article explains that the flaw exists not directly in OpenSSL's code, but how it’s used in an entropy-starved environment, which can be worsened by an additional step in OpenSSL that adds the time in seconds to the entropy pool between prime generations.
*   The researchers scanned every IPv4 address on the Internet, collecting 5.8 million SSL certificates and 10 million SSH host keys.
*   The article mentions that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two 1024-bit RSA moduli can be computed in around 17µs using a desktop computer.
*   They used an optimized method based on Dan Bernstein’s work to compute GCDs across the whole dataset, allowing them to factor the keys in a few hours instead of years.
*   The authors mention they are withholding specific vendor information until they have contacted them directly.
