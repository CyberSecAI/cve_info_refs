Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of SLING-2512, which appears to be related to CVE-2012-3353:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The JCR ContentLoader in Apache Sling was allowing the use of file elements in XML imports even when the location of the XML file wasn't available. This was a regression introduced by the fix for SLING-1161, which aimed to make initial content loading of binary files easier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of file elements in XML imports when location information is missing.
- Unintended exposure of file system access capabilities via the content loader when a location is not properly set.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
While not explicitly stated, the ability to use file elements when the location is not available implies that a malicious actor could potentially manipulate the content loader to access files within the system that they normally shouldn't have access to, or potentially use it to write files if the functionality exists. It bypasses security checks based on the expected content load location.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted XML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XML file that could be used by the content loader. 
- The attacker would need to be in a position to cause the content loader to use the maliciously crafted XML file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was fixed in JCR ContentLoader 2.1.6.
- The issue is related to the content loader and its XML import mechanism specifically.
- The severity is marked as "Major".
- The description indicates the issue was not intended and introduced as part of a previous fix.
- The provided text does not indicate the scope of the file access and further research into the code and functionality would be needed to determine the full impact of exploitation.
