Hi.

Thanks for the report and the patch!

And sorry for the long delay.

I have made minor modifications to the patches.

(will attach next).

I have to admit though, that I did not quite understand the problem though.

The seeding of the hash seems reasonabe in any case, but for, the loading of your hashes page takes approximately the same time

- without a proxy

- with unpatched tinyproxy

- with patched tinyproxy.

Maybe it is simply too late here and I am doing something wrong,

but could you please explain some more what you are experiencing

with and without the patches?

Thanks - Michael

To be quite clear: I see the danger of hash collisions and also understand the risk of higher CPU consumption when the hashes collide since behind a hash, we have a linear list in the bucket.

But since the "hashofheaders" is currently only built of 32 buckets,

(i.e. a 5 bit hash), with a big number of headers, we will have many

many collisions anyway. So I dont't quite see the point. What am I thinking wrong?

Maybe we should use a tree implementation, e.g. an rbtree.

That would give us really quick searching.

Cheers - Michael

Pickup an rbtree implementation from the tofu repo:

<https://banu.com/cgit/tofu/tree/tofu/>

It's standalone and would need some minor editing to remove the tofu prefixes from symbols. Deletion from this tree is not possible though (as it's unnecessary in tofu). If we want deletion, I'll give you another local implementation.

Using maps from libHX

Supports deletion, etc.

This needs more testing because I am not sufficiently familiar with tinyproxy to get this crash-free.

Hi.

Thanks for the report and the patch!

And sorry for the long delay.

I have made minor modifications to the patches.

(will attach next).

I have to admit though, that I did not quite understand the problem though.

The seeding of the hash seems reasonabe in any case, but for, the loading of your hashes page takes approximately the same time

- without a proxy

- with unpatched tinyproxy

- with patched tinyproxy.

Maybe it is simply too late here and I am doing something wrong,

but could you please explain some more what you are experiencing

with and without the patches?

Thanks - Michael

To be quite clear: I see the danger of hash collisions and also understand the risk of higher CPU consumption when the hashes collide since behind a hash, we have a linear list in the bucket.

But since the "hashofheaders" is currently only built of 32 buckets,

(i.e. a 5 bit hash), with a big number of headers, we will have many

many collisions anyway. So I dont't quite see the point. What am I thinking wrong?

Maybe we should use a tree implementation, e.g. an rbtree.

That would give us really quick searching.

Pickup an rbtree implementation from the tofu repo:

<https://banu.com/cgit/tofu/tree/tofu/>

It's standalone and would need some minor editing to remove the tofu prefixes from symbols. Deletion from this tree is not possible though (as it's unnecessary in tofu). If we want deletion, I'll give you another local implementation.

Using maps from libHX

Supports deletion, etc.

This needs more testing because I am not sufficiently familiar with tinyproxy to get this crash-free.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Will try to get something done ASAP.

Should I do something about stable too? The codebase should be really
similar.

I looked at the current prepared version for unstable in the tinyproxy
subversion repository, attached is the debdiff to the current version
in unstable.

Are you fine if I upload this as it is to unstable?

@SecurityTeam: I'm not Maintainer of the package but tinyproxy
appeared on the radar for RC bugs for wheezy, so noticed this one.

Regards,
Salvatore

Thanks for your work. It looks good. The changelog does have some quirks:
your version number is not NMU-style but maintianer-style, you're not
Jordi Mallach and you added a dot in an unrelated stanza. If you fix these
small items up, please upload this.

Cheers,
Thijs

I actually haven't done the 'real' work. All the real work was already
prepared by Jordi Mallach who pushed his work to the svn repository. I
know he would not be able to upload the package itself in next month,
so I had a look what he did, and builded his version. He asked if
someone can upload this for him.

I'm sorry if I was not clear about this.

Regards,
Salvatore

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
