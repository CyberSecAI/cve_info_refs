I believe this one was meant to be CVE-2012-2252...

I've uploaded rssh-2.3.4 to the project's web page, as well as to
sourceforge.  This update includes the fix for CVE-2012-2252, and also
rolls up a fix for CVE-2012-3478, for which I had previously only
posted a patch.  Additionally there are some mostly trivial updates
for code and build clean-up.

Thanks!  I'm happy to share the patches that I have for the Debian package
if Red Hat would also like to use them.  They're somewhat different than
upstream (or, rather, I had to layer additional patches on top of
upstream) because Debian adds support for the new rsync protocol flags and
for svnserve as a supported program, which required changes to the patch.

Message-ID: <87628q1nak.fsf@windlord.stanford.edu>
Date: Fri, 10 Aug 2012 13:53:39 -0700
From: Russ Allbery <rra@...nford.edu>

Subject: CVE Request: rssh command-line parsing vulnerability

Hello all,

I'm the Debian maintainer of the rssh package, which has a security
vulnerability in its command-line parsing disclosed some time back on the
rssh mailing list and on BUGTRAQ.  I'm preparing a security update for
Debian and would like a CVE for tracking purposes.

The security advisory from the upstream maintainer is at:
<http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=29235647>

Here are the relevant contents:

| rssh is a shell for restricting SSH access to a machine to only scp,
| sftp, or a small set of similar applications.
|
|   <http://www.pizzashack.org/rssh/>
|
| Henrik Erkkonen has discovered that, through clever manipulation of
| environment variables on the ssh command line, it is possible to
| circumvent rssh.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to effect a
| root compromise, except of course if the root account is the one
| you're attempting to protect with rssh...
|
[...]
|
| Note in particular that ensuring that the AcceptEnv sshd configuration
| option need not be turned on for this exploit to work.

I think this would fit the definition of "local privilege escalation" in
that it allows users with a restricted shell to run commands they
shouldn't be able to run.

The last two messages on the thread linked above contain a patch.  (Be
aware that they've been mangled by the Sourceforge mailing list archive,
so you have to download them to see them.)  There has been no subsequent
formal release, just the patch in that thread.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
