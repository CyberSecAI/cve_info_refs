{
  "CVE-2012-3467": {
    "Root cause": "The Apache Qpid daemon (qpidd) did not require authentication for \"catch-up\" shadow connections created when a new broker joins a cluster.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing authentication for catch-up shadow connections",
      "Use of NullAuthenticator mechanism"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious client could use this flaw to bypass client authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the broker.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious AMQP client application could establish a phoney shadow connection to the AMQP broker, leading it to consider the connection a legitimate one from another AMQP broker, thus bypassing authentication."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create a connection that appears to be a 'catch-up' shadow connection from another broker."
  }
