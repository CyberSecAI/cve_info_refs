Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an arbitrary file upload flaw in the `doajaxfileupload.php` file of the MM Forms Community WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin's file upload functionality does not properly validate file types or names, allowing an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The script does not sanitize user input, allowing malicious files to be uploaded.
- **Direct Access to Upload Directory:** The `/upload/temp/` directory is directly accessible, allowing uploaded files to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading and executing a PHP file (e.g., a web shell), an attacker can gain full control of the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Server Compromise:** Once the attacker has gained access via code execution they can install malware, deface the site, steal data, or use it as a jumping-off point for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to `http://www.exemple.com/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mm-forms-community/includes/doajaxfileupload.php` with a malicious file attached.
- **Direct File Upload:** The vulnerability allows uploading a file without proper authentication or authorization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is present in a public facing script and does not require any authentication to exploit.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Plugin Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable plugin, or be able to enumerate this path through other vulnerabilities or information disclosure.
