Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2012-3720:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way mobile accounts stored password hashes. Creating a mobile account saved a hash of the password within the account, which was then used for login when the mobile account was used as an external account.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The password hash stored in the mobile account could be used to determine the user's password, effectively revealing the password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A user with access to the contents of a mobile account could obtain the account password.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the mobile account contents is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the mobile account files.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by creating the password hash only if external accounts are enabled on the system where the mobile account is created.
- This issue affects OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by Harald Wagener of Google, Inc.
