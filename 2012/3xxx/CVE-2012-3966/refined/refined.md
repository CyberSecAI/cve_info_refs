  "CVE-2012-3966": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way Firefox decoded embedded bitmap images in Icon Format (ICO) files. A web page containing a malicious ICO file could cause Firefox to crash or, under certain conditions, possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. (CVE-2012-3966)",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is in the nsICODecoder::FixBitmapHeight function. The \"height\" variable is declared as a PRInt32, which is a signed 32 bits integer. If the \"height\" field of the BMP header is negative, it will pass the check and then be truncated to fit into a 8 bits integer, causing the processing of the transparency bitmask to write past the imageData array, resulting in memory corruption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to incorrect height handling in bitmap image decoding."
    ],
    "impact": "A web page containing a malicious ICO file could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By tricking a user into opening a web page with a specially crafted ICO image"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "A malicious web page or other method to cause Firefox to process a malicious ICO file. No special user privileges needed."

        "root_cause": "Security researcher miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover two WebGL issues. The first issue is a use-after-free when WebGL shaders are called after being destroyed. The second issue exposes a problem with Mesa drivers on Linux, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.",
