  "CVE-2012-3461": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the Base64 decoder of libotr.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflows"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted OTR message that, when processed, would cause the application to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. This can lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a malformed OTR message via the network.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker capable of sending network messages to an application using the vulnerable libotr library."
