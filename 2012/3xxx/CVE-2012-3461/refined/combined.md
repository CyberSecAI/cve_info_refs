Package        : libotr
Vulnerability  : heap-based buffer overflows
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 684121
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3461

Just Ferguson discovered that libotr, an off-the-record (OTR) messaging
library, can be forced to perform zero-length allocations for heap buffers
that are used in base64 decoding routines.  An attacker can exploit this
flaw by sending crafted messages to an application that is using libotr to
perform denial of service attacks or potentially execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.0-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libotr packages.

> Hi, what is the status of file transfers over OTR?

libotr now supports the ability for an application to produce an "extra
symmetric key" at both ends of an OTR conversation.  Applications would
then need to support using that key to do secure file transfer.  We had
an implementation a while back, but if I remember correctly, it sent the
file inline, which has two major drawbacks:

- The big file gets sent via the IM server, which may get upset if it's
  really big
- Your IM conversation is blocked until the file finishes being sent

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=846377#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-07 15:24:48 UTC  ``` Multiple heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way the Base64 decoder of libotr, an Off-The-Record Messaging library and toolkit, performed decoding of certain messages. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted OTR message that once processed in an application linked against libotr would lead to that application crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

Date: Tue, 7 Aug 2012 12:49:51 +0200
```
Hi,

I just uploaded 3.2.1-1 to unstable, it contains the changes listed here:

<http://otr.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=otr/libotr;a=log;h=refs/heads/3.2_dev>

I'm CC'ing security as I suppose they might want to push this package
to unstable as well.

Note, the only difference between 3.2.0-4 (currently in testing) and
3.2.1-1 (just uploaded to unstable) is the security fix, see the
attached debdiff on the unblock request #684140.

The only difference between 3.2.0-2 in stable and 3.2.0-4 in testing
are packaging cosmetics (shipping .pc, null out dependency_libs in .la
and lintian fixes).
