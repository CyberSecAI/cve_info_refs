Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in OpenJPEG, an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C.
- The overflow occurs during the parsing of JPEG2000 files, specifically when handling the number of tiles and tilesizes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- Improper input validation of tile number and tile size parameters in the JPEG2000 file format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Application crash due to memory corruption.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted JPEG 2000 file.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an application linked against the vulnerable version of OpenJPEG processes the malicious JPEG 2000 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious JPEG 2000 file to a system that will process it with an application linked against the vulnerable version of OpenJPEG.
- No user interaction is explicitly stated as a requirement.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects parsing of JPEG2000 files with a specific number of tiles and tilesizes.
- A patch is available that addresses this flaw
- Red Hat has issued an advisory (RHSA-2012:1068) that fixes this issue and it affects multiple versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
