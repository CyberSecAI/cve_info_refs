1) Introduction
===============
From vendor's homepage:
"Pro-Server EX is a powerful, yet cost effective data management server
that provides real-time reporting of automated manufacturing and
production environments at a fraction of the price of a full SCADA
system."
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
By default Pro-Server EX (ProServr.exe) runs as a stand-alone server
but it can be set as a Windows service during the installation, this
second mode is suggested by the vendor.
------------------------------------
A] "Find Node" invalid memory access
------------------------------------
The server trusts a 32bit "number of elements" value used locate the
subsequent string in the received packet.
If the packet contains a particular flag then the following function
will try to check the presence of the string "\x1c" "Find Node\0" "ASP"
at that arbitrary location:
0033650C |. 8D4486 04 LEA EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+EAX\*4+4] ; seek
...
00336400 /$ A1 9C7A3A00 MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[3A7A9C] ; the function
00336405 |. 8038 1C CMP BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],1C
00336408 |. 74 03 JE SHORT TDASforW.0033640D
0033640A |> 32C0 XOR AL,AL
0033640C |. C3 RETN
This bug works also if the server is protected by password (max 8 bytes
xored with 0xff) and the attacker doesn't know it.
--------------------------
B] memset integer overflow
--------------------------
Through the opcode 0x07 -> 0x5/0x6/0x7 it's possible to exploit an
integer overflow for allocating a buffer of 0 bytes but a memset()
after it allows only to exploit this bug for crashing the server due to
a buffer-overflow of zeroes (unfortunately memcpy can't be reached):
0033660C |. 8B7D 18 MOV EDI,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+18] ; our 32bit value
0033660F |. 83C7 18 ADD EDI,18 ; + 0x18
00336612 |. B9 988C3A00 MOV ECX,TDASforW.003A8C98
00336617 |. 8D1C07 LEA EBX,DWORD PTR DS:[EDI+EAX]
0033661A |. E8 C14CFFFF CALL TDASforW.?Lock@GaMutex@@QAEXXZ
0033661F |. 8B35 3C8C3A00 MOV ESI,DWORD PTR DS:[3A8C3C]
00336625 |. 03F3 ADD ESI,EBX
00336627 |. B9 988C3A00 MOV ECX,TDASforW.003A8C98
0033662C |. 8935 3C8C3A00 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[3A8C3C],ESI
00336632 |. E8 A921FFFF CALL TDASforW.?Unlock@GaMutex@@QAEXXZ
00336637 |. 8D4B 04 LEA ECX,DWORD PTR DS:[EBX+4]
0033663A |. 51 PUSH ECX
0033663B |. E8 045F0300 CALL  ; malloc + 4
00336640 |. 53 PUSH EBX
00336641 |. 8D70 04 LEA ESI,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+4]
00336644 |. 6A 00 PUSH 0
00336646 |. 56 PUSH ESI
00336647 |. 8918 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX],EBX ; memset crash
00336649 |. FF15 28803800 CALL DWORD PTR DS:[<&GAOS.?osUTmemset@>
0033664F |. 57 PUSH EDI
00336650 |. 55 PUSH EBP
00336651 |. 56 PUSH ESI
00336652 |. FF15 24803800 CALL DWORD PTR DS:[<&GAOS.?osUTmemcpy@>
----------------------
C] Unhandled exception
----------------------
Through the opcode 0x07 -> 0x5/0x6/0x7 it's possible to terminate the
server due to an unhandled exception ("Runtime Error") caused by a too
big amount of data to allocate.
--------------------------------------------
D] Invalid memory read access and disclosure
--------------------------------------------
Through the opcode 0x07 -> 0x5/0x6/0x7/0x14 it's possible to crash the
server specifying a big size value so that it's impossible to copy the
data from the source packet using the osUTmemcpy function.
The opcode 0x7 -> 0x14 is a bit more interesting because it returns a
desired amount of memory back to the client and so it's possible to see
all the memory till the end of the buffer.
--------------------------------------
E] Possible limited memory corruptions
--------------------------------------
Often the server reuses the same memory used for the input packet for
modifying it and then sending it back to the client.
The lack of checks on the size of the received packet allows an
attacker to send a small packet and then forcing the server to write
its fields at those positions higher than the allocated packet size
corrupting the heap.
An example of these memory corruptions happen with the opcode
0x7->0x14:
0033CE2F . 33C9 XOR ECX,ECX
0033CE31 . 3BD1 CMP EDX,ECX
0033CE33 . 66:8948 04 MOV WORD PTR DS:[EAX+4],CX
0033CE37 . C740 1C 16260000 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+1C],2616
0033CE3E . 8948 24 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+24],ECX
0033CE41 . 8948 28 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+28],ECX
0033CE44 . 8948 2C MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+2C],ECX
0033CE47 . 8948 30 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+30],ECX
0033CE4A . 8948 34 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+34],ECX
0033CE4D . 8948 38 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+38],ECX
0033CE50 . 8948 3C MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+3C],ECX
0033CE53 . 8948 40 MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+40],ECX
Anyway in this example ECX is just zero so not much useful but it's
only to demonstrate a big chunk of code since there are some other
places where are performed no checks on the received packet size.
Note that this attack is possible only if no bigger packets have been
received previously because the memory buffer is one and fits the
latest biggest packet.
PCRuntime.exe uses also the TCP port 8000 which is fully compatible
with the protocol running on the UDP one (type, flags, size, data).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

ICS Advisory
# Pro-Face Pro-Server EX Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedSeptember 06, 2018
Alert CodeICSA-12-179-01

## Overview

This advisory is a follow-up to the alert titled “[ICS-ALERT-12-137-01 Pro-face Pro-Server EX Vulnerabilities](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-12-137-01),” that was published May 16, 2012, on the ICS-CERT Web page.

Independent researcher Luigi Auriemma identified multiple vulnerabilities in the Pro-face Pro-Server EX application and publicly released this information without coordination with ICS-CERT, the vendor, or any other coordinating entity known to ICS-CERT.

The four confirmed vulnerabilities are invalid memory access, integer overflow, unhandled exception, and memory corruptions. Each of these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, and public exploits are known to target these vulnerabilities.

ICS-CERT has coordinated these vulnerabilities with the development and manufacturing company of Pro-face branded products, Digital Electronics, which has produced an update that resolves these vulnerabilities.

## Affected Products

Digital Electronics reports that the vulnerabilities affect the following products.

* data management software Pro-Server EX versions 1.00.00 through 1.30.00, and
* HMI screen editor and logic programming software GP-Pro EX and related software WinGP Versions 2.00.00 through 3.01.100.

## Impact

Exploitation of the reported vulnerabilities can result in a denial of service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution.

Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

## Background

Pro-face is HMI-related hardware and software product found in a wide range of industries such as oil and gas, food and beverage, and water and wastewater industries. Pro-face products are used throughout the world, the highest number sold in Japan and the Asian Pacific area. According to its Web site, Pro-Server EX is a data management server that collects information generated by a PLC system through an HMI unit and generates reports. In February 2001, Pro-face America, Inc., a subsidiary of Digital Electronics Corporation, purchased Xycom Automation.

## Vulnerability Characterization

## Mitigation

Digital Electronics has released patch modules on its Web site at the following location: http://www.pro-face.com/news/2012/0606.html.

The patch module prevents the Pro-Server EX and WinGP from an attack using inaccurate packets.

Digital Electronics recommends the following in addition to applying the patch:

* Review all network configurations for control system devices.
* Remove unnecessary PCs from control system networks.
* Remove unnecessary applications from control system networks.

ICS-CERT encourages asset owners to take additional defensive measures to protect against this and other cybersecurity risks.

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

The Control Systems Security Program (CSSP) also provides [a section for control systems security recommended practices](/ics/recommended-practices) on the CSSP Web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf). ICS-CERT reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to taking defensive measures.

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to ICS-CERT for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
