Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2012-3399

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `diff.php` script of Basilic 1.5.14, which is susceptible to a metacharacter injection. This means the script does not properly sanitize or validate input, allowing an attacker to inject shell metacharacters within the `file` parameter of a GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection, where an attacker can inject arbitrary commands via the `file` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user (e.g., `www-data`).
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the web server user and other system configurations, this could potentially lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is conducted via specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `diff.php` script.
- **`file` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected through the `file` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server running the vulnerable Basilic application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication.
- **Knowledge of Target Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the `diff.php` script within the Basilic installation.

**Technical Details:**
- The `diff.php` script uses the `file` parameter directly in a system call, likely a command-line utility such as `diff`.
- The injected payload is prepended with a `&` which enables the command to be executed.
- Example payload: `file=%26cat%20/etc/passwd` which executes the command `cat /etc/passwd`

**Additional Details:**
- A Metasploit module has been created to exploit this vulnerability, which can be used for penetration testing and security research.
-  The Metasploit module explicitly targets Linux and Unix based platforms and  uses a command injection payload.
