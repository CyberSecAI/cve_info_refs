  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `get_image_dimensions()` function in Django's image handling facilities uses a fixed 1024-byte chunk size when reading image data to determine dimensions. This can result in many read/process cycles for image formats (like TIFF) that don't store dimension information in the initial chunk, consuming excessive server resources.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by uploading a crafted image, such as a large TIFF image, leading to excessive process/thread consumption.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Uploading a specially crafted image file to a Django application that uses `get_image_dimensions()`."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to upload files to a Django application and knowledge of the vulnerability to craft a specific image that triggers the issue."
