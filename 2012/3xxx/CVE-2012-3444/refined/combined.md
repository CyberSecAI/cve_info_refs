## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

It was discovered that Django incorrectly validated the scheme of a

redirect target. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted

URL, an attacker could possibly exploit this to conduct cross-site

scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2012-3442](/security/CVE-2012-3442))

It was discovered that Django incorrectly handled validating certain

images. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the server to

consume memory, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3443](/security/CVE-2012-3443))

Jeroen Dekkers discovered that Django incorrectly handled certain image

dimensions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the server to

consume resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3444](/security/CVE-2012-3444))

## Security releases issued

Posted by **James Bennett** on July 30, 2012

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.3.2 and
Django 1.4.1 -- to remedy security issues reported to
us.

All users are encouraged to upgrade Django immediately.

### Cross-site scripting in authentication views

The `login()` and `logout()` views provided in Django's
authentication framework make use of the common "POST-redirect-GET"
pattern; a configurable querystring parameter can be used to specify
the location to redirect to on successful submission. Currently, those
views perform basic validation to ensure that the redirect location
does not specify a different domain.

However, this validation does not check the scheme of the target URL;
armed with this knowledge, an attacker can craft, for example, a
`data:` scheme URL which will execute JavaScript.

Some browsers are known to currently provide protection against this
issue: Google Chrome in particular explicitly disallows redirects to
`data:` scheme URLs. However, several other major browsers do permit
such redirects.

After careful consideration of this issue, we have decided that the
safest course of action involves a slight break to backwards
compatibility. Although temporary mitigation could be achieved through
more stringent validation in the relevant views, the root issue lies
in Django's HTTP response classes, which currently do not perform any
validation of redirect targets. The fact that some major browsers
already disallow certain URL schemes in redirects indicates that the
impact of this change is likely to be minimal.

As such, the following change is being made despite breaking API
compatibility:

* `django.http.HttpResponseRedirect` and `django.http.HttpResponsePermanentRedirect` now subclass a common base class, `django.http.HttpResponseRedirectBase`.
* That base class defines an explicit whitelist of allowed URL schemes. Attempts to instantiate a redirect with a URL of a scheme not in the whitelist will raise the exception `django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation`, which is already employed for similar purposes in other parts of Django's codebase (e.g., to warn of possible session tampering).

End-user code which issues redirects is unlikely to be affected unless
it either explicitly requires redirecting to an unsupported scheme, or
accepts the target URL from a user-supplied parameter.

In the former case, subclassing the appropriate redirect class
(`HttpResponseRedirect` for status code 302,
`HttpResponsePermanentRedirect` for status code 301) and overriding
the `allowed_schemes` list will be sufficient. The default value of
`allowed_schemes` is `['http', 'https', 'ftp']`.

In the latter case, code which accepts user-supplied parameters can
attempt to instantiate the redirect, catch the `SuspiciousOperation`
exception, and fall back to an alternate location as needed.

At present, Django's authentication views will leave this exception
**uncaught**. This means site administrators will receive error reports if/when that exception is raised. It is likely that future Django releases will begin catching this exception, after allowing some time for users of Django to observe behavior and judge their exposure to potential issues.

### Denial-of-service in image validation

Django's form system includes field types for handling file uploads,
including a field class -- `django.forms.ImageField` -- for
uploading images, which can perform some validation of image formats.

Part of that validation involves detecting corrupted image files,
using routines provided by the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

The check as it currently exists in Django is vulnerable, however,
because it will read the entire image file, including decompressing
compressed formats as needed. It is trivially possible to craft a
reasonably-sized file which, when decompressed in this fashion, grows
to enormous size, consuming available memory and offering the ability
to perform a denial-of-service attack.

To mitigate this, image validation will now make use of PIL's
`Image.verify()` method, which performs some validation checks but
does not decompress or read the entire image file.

### Denial-of-service via get\_image\_dimensions()

Django's image-handling facilities also include helper methods to
determine the dimensions of an image. Currently, the process for this
involves reading a 1024-byte chunk from the start of the file, and
passing to PIL to determine the dimensions; if insufficient data is
provided, further 1024-byte chunks are read until PIL is able to
return a definite answer.

While this works well for image formats which store enough information
in their headers to determine dimensions, it can result in large
quantities of read/process cycles for formats which do not. In
particular, larger TIFF images can require tens of thousands of such
cycles, tying up or timing out worker processes/threads and consuming
enough server resources to result in an effective denial-of-service.

To mitigate this, the algorithm for determining image dimensions is
being changed; the initial attempt will still use a 1024-byte chunk,
but the chunk size will be doubled on each successive read. Testing
has demonstrated that this reduces time to process TIFF files by
multiple orders of magnitude.

### Affected versions

The issues described above are present in the following versions of
Django:

* Django development master branch
* Django 1.4
* Django 1.3

### Resolution

Patches have been applied to Django's development master branch, and to the 1.4 and 1.3 release branches, which resolve the three security issues described above. The patches may be obtained directly from the following changesets:

* Development master branch: [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/4129201c3e0fa057c198bdefcb34686a23b4a93c) for the redirect issue, [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/b1d463468694f2e91fde67221b7996e9c52a9720) for the image-validation issue and [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/dd16b17099b7d86f27773df048c5014cf439b282) for the image-dimensions issue.
* Django 1.4: [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/e34685034b60be1112160e76091e5aee60149fa1) for the redirect issue, [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/c14f325c4eef628bc7bfd8873c3a72aeb0219141) for the image-validation issue and [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/da33d67181b53fe6cc737ac1220153814a1509f6) for the image-dimensions issue.
* Django 1.3: [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/4dea4883e6c50d75f215a6b9bcbd95273f57c72d) for the redirect issue, [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/b2eb4787a0fff9c9993b78be5c698e85108f3446) for the image-validation issue and [commit](https://github.com/django/django/commit/9ca0ff6268eeff92d0d0ac2c315d4b6a8e229155) for the image-dimensions issue.

The following new releases have been issued:

* Django 1.4.1 ([download](/download/1.4.1/tarball/) | [checksums](/download/1.4.1/checksum/))
* Django 1.3.2 ([download](/download/1.3.2/tarball/) | [checksums](/download/1.3.2/checksum/)) Please use [Django 1.3.3](/weblog/2012/aug/01/django-13-bugfix-release/) instead

As Django's development branch is currently in a pre-alpha state, users are strongly advised not to be running production deployments from it; if you are currently doing so, however, you are urged to upgrade imediately to the latest HEAD, which contains the above patches.

### Credits

The issue with determining image dimensions was reported to us Jeroen Dekkers. The image-validation issue was reported as a regular bug by a user in Django's Trac. The redirect issue was reported by a source who has chosen to remain anonymous.

### Known status of these issues

The Django team has been provided with information which indicates that knowledge of the redirect issue extends beyond the original reporter, and may either currently be or soon be exploited by persons in possession of that knowledge. And as noted above, the image-validation issue was originally reported to Django's public bug tracker.

As such, we again urge all users of affected versions of Django to upgrade immediately.

### General notes regarding security

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via private email to `security@djangoproject.com`, and not via Django's Trac instance or the django-developers list.

If you are or represent a third-party distributor of Django and did not receive a notification email regarding this announcement from the Django release manager, please contact `james@b-list.org`.

Package        : python-django
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3442 CVE-2012-3443 CVE-2012-3444
Debian Bug     : 683364

Jeroen Dekkers and others reported several vulnerabilities in Django,
a Python Web framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project defines the following issues:

CVE-2012-3442

    Two functions do not validate the scheme of a redirect target,
    which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attacks via a data: URL.

CVE-2012-3443

    The ImageField class completely decompresses image data during image
    validation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (memory consumption) by uploading an image file.

CVE-2012-3444

    The get_image_dimensions function in the image-handling functionality
    uses a constant chunk size in all attempts to determine dimensions,
    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process
    or thread consumption) via a large TIFF image.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.

Subject: CVE Request: Django 1.3.1 and 1.4.0 security issues

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

<https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2012/jul/30/security-releases-issued/>

Security releases issued

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.3.2 and
Django 1.4.1 -- to remedy security issues reported to us.

All users are encouraged to upgrade Django immediately.

=========================================
Cross-site scripting in authentication views

The login() and logout() views provided in Django's authentication
framework make use of the common "POST-redirect-GET" pattern; a
configurable querystring parameter can be used to specify the location
to redirect to on successful submission. Currently, those views
perform basic validation to ensure that the redirect location does not
specify a different domain.

However, this validation does not check the scheme of the target URL;
armed with this knowledge, an attacker can craft, for example, a data:
scheme URL which will execute JavaScript.

Some browsers are known to currently provide protection against this
issue: Google Chrome in particular explicitly disallows redirects to
data: scheme URLs. However, several other major browsers do permit
such redirects.

After careful consideration of this issue, we have decided that the
safest course of action involves a slight break to backwards
compatibility. Although temporary mitigation could be achieved through
more stringent validation in the relevant views, the root issue lies
in Django's HTTP response classes, which currently do not perform any
validation of redirect targets. The fact that some major browsers
already disallow certain URL schemes in redirects indicates that the
impact of this change is likely to be minimal.

As such, the following change is being made despite breaking API
compatibility:

    django.http.HttpResponseRedirect and
django.http.HttpResponsePermanentRedirect now subclass a common base
class, django.http.HttpResponseRedirectBase.
    That base class defines an explicit whitelist of allowed URL
schemes. Attempts to instantiate a redirect with a URL of a scheme not
in the whitelist will raise the exception
django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation, which is already employed
for similar purposes in other parts of Django's codebase (e.g., to
warn of possible session tampering).

End-user code which issues redirects is unlikely to be affected unless
it either explicitly requires redirecting to an unsupported scheme, or
accepts the target URL from a user-supplied parameter.

In the former case, subclassing the appropriate redirect class
(HttpResponseRedirect for status code 302,
HttpResponsePermanentRedirect for status code 301) and overriding the
allowed_schemes list will be sufficient. The default value of
allowed_schemes is ['http', 'https', 'ftp'].

In the latter case, code which accepts user-supplied parameters can
attempt to instantiate the redirect, catch the SuspiciousOperation
exception, and fall back to an alternate location as needed.

At present, Django's authentication views will leave this exception
uncaught. This means site administrators will receive error reports
if/when that exception is raised. It is likely that future Django
releases will begin catching this exception, after allowing some time
for users of Django to observe behavior and judge their exposure to
potential issues.

=========================================
Denial-of-service in image validation

Django's form system includes field types for handling file uploads,
including a field class -- django.forms.ImageField -- for uploading
images, which can perform some validation of image formats.

Part of that validation involves detecting corrupted image files,
using routines provided by the Python Imaging Library (PIL).

The check as it currently exists in Django is vulnerable, however,
because it will read the entire image file, including decompressing
compressed formats as needed. It is trivially possible to craft a
reasonably-sized file which, when decompressed in this fashion, grows
to enormous size, consuming available memory and offering the ability
to perform a denial-of-service attack.

To mitigate this, image validation will now make use of PIL's
Image.verify() method, which performs some validation checks but does
not decompress or read the entire image file.

=========================================
Denial-of-service via get_image_dimensions()

Django's image-handling facilities also include helper methods to
determine the dimensions of an image. Currently, the process for this
involves reading a 1024-byte chunk from the start of the file, and
passing to PIL to determine the dimensions; if insufficient data is
provided, further 1024-byte chunks are read until PIL is able to
return a definite answer.

While this works well for image formats which store enough information
in their headers to determine dimensions, it can result in large
quantities of read/process cycles for formats which do not. In
particular, larger TIFF images can require tens of thousands of such
cycles, tying up or timing out worker processes/threads and consuming
enough server resources to result in an effective denial-of-service.

To mitigate this, the algorithm for determining image dimensions is
being changed; the initial attempt will still use a 1024-byte chunk,
but the chunk size will be doubled on each successive read. Testing
has demonstrated that this reduces time to process TIFF files by
multiple orders of magnitude.
