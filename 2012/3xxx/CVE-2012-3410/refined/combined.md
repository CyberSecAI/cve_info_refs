From: Marcus Meissner <meissner@...e.de>

Subject: CVE Request: Overflow fix in bash 4.2 patch 33

Hi,

the bash maintainer kindly mailed us and other vendors a notification of
a overflow in the bash "test" builtin when "/dev/fd/..." filenames are used.

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/bash-4.2-patches/bash42-033

Reproducer:
	test -e /dev/fd/111111111111111111111111111111111

Problem is caught by -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 if enabled, and likely also
by -fstack-protector (not tested)

Goes all the way back to old bashes.

The likeliness of people able to inject those filenames into shell scripts
and not being able to execute shellcode themselves is however slim.
(setuid root shell scripts are not possible.)

Security (CVE) relevant scenario we thought of is breaking out of a
restricted shell mode.

Ciao, Marcus

Please use CVE-2012-3410 for this issue. The --restricted stuff is
advertised as a security measure and this can be used to bypass it, so
it gets a CVE.

# Bash: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201210-05**

Two vulnerabilities have been found in Bash, the worst of which may
allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-shells/bash** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2\_p37** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2\_p37** |

### Background

Bash is the standard GNU Bourne Again SHell.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been found in Bash:

* Bash example scripts do not handle temporary files securely
  (CVE-2008-5374).
* Improper bounds checking in Bash could cause a stack-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2012-3410).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted Bash
script, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, or a Denial of Service condition of the Bash
executable.

A local attacker may be able to perform symlink attacks to overwrite
arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the application
or bypass shell access restrictions.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Bash users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-shells/bash-4.2_p37"

```
### References

* [CVE-2008-5374](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-5374)

**Release date**

October 20, 2012

**Latest revision**

**Exploitable**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
