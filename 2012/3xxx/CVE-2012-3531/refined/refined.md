**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The TYPO3 Install Tool fails to properly sanitize user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to inadequate sanitization of user-supplied data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the context of a user's session in the Install Tool, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement
    *   Other malicious actions that could be carried out in the context of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating user input that is not properly sanitized by the install tool.
*   The specific attack vector would depend on the precise injection point in the Install Tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a valid backend user, or somehow gain access to a backend session, with access to the Install Tool
*   The attacker does not require prior knowledge of sensitive data, other than identifying the injection points within the install tool.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that this is considered a **Low** severity issue.
*   The fix is to upgrade to TYPO3 version 4.5.19, 4.6.12, or 4.7.4
