{
  "CVE-2012-3491": {
    "description": "The ability to abort a job in Condor only required WRITE authorization, instead of a combination of WRITE authorization and job ownership. This could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass intended restrictions and abort any idle job on the system.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because the authorization check for aborting jobs in Condor was insufficient. It only required WRITE permissions, instead of requiring both WRITE permissions and job ownership.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient Access Control",
      "Improper Authorization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with WRITE access could abort any idle job on the system, regardless of ownership. This could disrupt services and prevent legitimate users from completing their tasks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to Condor service"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have valid credentials and possess WRITE authorization within the Condor system. No specific attacker position, other than authenticated is required."
