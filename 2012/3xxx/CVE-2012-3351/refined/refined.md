Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3351:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input by the JW Player. Specifically, the `playerready` and `logo.link` parameters are vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user within the context of the affected website. This could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
    - Launch other attacks (e.g., redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website).
    - Potentially perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL: Attackers can craft a URL containing the malicious script within vulnerable parameters such as `playerready` or `logo.link` of the JW Player.
- Victim Interaction: The attacker needs to convince a user to click on this specially crafted link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a malicious link that points to a website using a vulnerable version of JW Player.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects JW Player version 5.9.2145 and earlier versions and 5.10.2295 and prior versions, but it is fixed in version 5.9.2206 and later.
- The advisory mentions two vulnerable parameters:`playerready` and `logo.link`, which were initially treated under the same BID, but later separated.

The provided content gives a good picture of the vulnerability and its exploitation details.
