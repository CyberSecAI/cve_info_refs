  "CVE-2012-3967": {
    "description": "The provided data reveals that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the WebGL implementation of Firefox. Specifically, when WebGL shaders were called after being destroyed, it could lead to a use-after-free condition. Additionally, the content suggests that a problem with Mesa drivers on Linux could cause a potentially exploitable crash due to stack scribbling with 4-byte values, when using more than 16 sampler uniforms.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is a combination of a use-after-free issue in WebGL shader handling and a memory corruption vulnerability triggered by a large number of sampler uniforms in Mesa drivers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free in WebGL shader handling",
        "Memory corruption in Mesa drivers",
	 "Stack buffer overflow when processing a large number of sampler uniforms."
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation could lead to a denial of service (application crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. The mesa driver issue leads to a crash that is potentially exploitable.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Visiting a specially crafted web page that leverages WebGL."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a specially crafted web page using WebGL."
