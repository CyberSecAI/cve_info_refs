Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3366:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a shell command injection flaw within the Bcfg2 configuration management system's server component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Shell command injection: Malicious clients can inject arbitrary shell commands that will be executed by the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows malicious clients to execute arbitrary commands on the server with root privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: Malicious clients send specially crafted requests to the Bcfg2 server to inject commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Bcfg2 server as a client.
- No authentication or privilege requirements for the client are explicitly mentioned beyond the ability to interact with the server.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `Trigger` plugin of the Bcfg2 server.
- The fix involves changes to how commands are executed, specifically using `Popen` with `pipes.quote` for sanitization in the `async_run` function to prevent command injection.
- The vulnerable code used `os.system`, which is vulnerable to shell injection, whereas the corrected code uses `Popen` which does not execute shell commands directly unless specified.
- The vulnerability was addressed in bcfg2 version 1.0.1-3+squeeze2 for the stable distribution (squeeze) and 1.2.2-2 for the unstable distribution (sid).
