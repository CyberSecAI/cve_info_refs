Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
In WordPress multisite installations, administrators and editors were unintentionally granted the `unfiltered_html` capability in version 3.4.0. This allowed them to bypass HTML filtering, potentially leading to privilege escalation and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users with the administrator or editor role on a multisite installation could potentially elevate their privileges by injecting arbitrary HTML code that would bypass normal filtering mechanisms.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The ability to use unfiltered HTML opens the door to XSS attacks, where malicious scripts could be injected and executed in the browsers of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious users could inject scripts to perform unauthorized actions, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.
- Attackers could potentially gain full control of websites on the multisite network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the WordPress backend, accessible to administrators and editors.
- Attackers would leverage the unfiltered_html capability to insert malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have at least the role of an administrator or editor in a WordPress multisite environment to exploit this.
- The attacker needs the ability to post or edit content, where the malicious HTML can be injected
