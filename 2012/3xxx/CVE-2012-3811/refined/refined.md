Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2012-3811:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Avaya IP Office Customer Call Reporter Wallboard application allowing unauthenticated users to upload files to the webserver through `ImageUpload.ashx`. This file upload function does not restrict file extensions, nor does it implement scripting restrictions in the upload directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated file upload: The application allows arbitrary file uploads without requiring authentication.
- Lack of file extension sanitization: The application does not strip file extensions from uploaded files.
- Missing scripting restrictions: The directory where uploaded files are stored does not prevent the execution of scripts contained within the uploaded files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: By uploading malicious files (e.g., web shells) an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server, with the privileges of the user running the application (typically NETWORK SERVICE).
- Complete compromise of the system: An attacker can potentially gain full control of the server, leading to further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability can be exploited over the network via HTTP requests to upload files to a webserver.
- Unauthenticated: No user authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected Avaya IP Office Customer Call Reporter application.
- No specific privileges or authentication is needed, an attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was initially reported by Andrea Micalizzi of Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and is tracked as ZDI-12-106.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '12384'.
- Avaya has released patches for IP Office Customer Call Reporter versions 7.0 and 8.0 to address this vulnerability.
