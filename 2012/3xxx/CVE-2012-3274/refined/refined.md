{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the uam.exe component when logging received actions to a log file. The sprintf function is used to build the log message, but the process does not properly verify if the destination buffer on the stack is large enough to handle the newly created string.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when using sprintf.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM user privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote network access via UDP port 1811.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No authentication is required. An attacker needs to send a crafted message to UDP port 1811 on the vulnerable server."
