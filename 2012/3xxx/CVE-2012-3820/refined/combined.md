### My First Experiences Bug Hunting, Part 2

So in [Part 1](http://sadgeeksinsnow.blogspot.com/2012/09/my-first-experiences-bug-hunting-part-1.html) I disclosed the specifics of [CVE-2012-3819](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3819), and I ended with the concept of loading a debugger ([OllyDbg](http://www.ollydbg.de/) in this case) in order to analyze the program while it crashes from the stack overflow exception. During this process it is easy to note that no control of the EIP register is obtained - and thus the bug is relegated to a generic [DoS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) type bug.

As you can see the registers remain largely intact. EAX is a pointer on the stack (which is very low at the point of crashing, due to the stack consumption). So it is shown that the impact of this bug is likely very small. But since we have the debugger open anyway, we go ahead and do a search for strings. This is so we can see what else might be of interest just while we're in town.

To do this we first want to be analyzing the actual executable, in this case: "Campaign11.exe" which is the primary executable for Campaign Enterprise 11, my installation is a previous version (11.0.538). This software, of which I found another five vulnerabilities within, is used to send e-mails to large lists of individuals. It is an excellent marketing tool. Including the recent fixes for these bugs (version 11.0.551), I believe it will be that much better now. We click View in the menu and select "Executable Modules" which loads a list of the images presently mapped to memory. We then double click the entry which lists Campaign11.exe and this loads that module into the CPU window.

Right clicking in the instruction pane of the CPU window we choose "Search for -> All referenced text strings." This loads a list of things that look like strings in the Campaign11.exe application. This will provide us a great deal of insight into the inner-workings of the application. First I note at the top of this list are several tell-tale signs that it was programmed in Visual Basic. Including typical VB style nomenclature for control names, etc.

Knowing one of the key failures in many web based applications is [SQL Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection) (SQLi) I begin looking for SQL strings of interest. I right click in the list of strings and select "Search for text," running this command I seek out instances of "select \* from" which is ubiquitous. I repeat this search, seeking things that look interesting. I find several entries that could be fun:
> 004C6143   PUSH Campaign.00426428                    UNICODE "select \* from tblUsers where "UID"="

> 004C624D   PUSH Campaign.004264AC                    UNICODE "select \* from tblUsers where UID="

There are many of these, but they all seem invaluable - they appear to be the first start of a string concatenation which may lead to SQL injection - and this is the sort of code you would associate with the login screen. I find all instances of "select \* from tblUsers" and set break points on each. I use Ctrl+L to go to the next, then use F2 to speed the process of "red-pointing."

Then I try to login (plus a little SQL Injection since I'm expecting the possibility) to see if I won anything....

Damn. I see my SQLi is thwarted likely by a call to replace("'", "''"). Scrolling up some you can see this call does in fact happen. I see down in the current operands area that the string we're specifically dealing with is
"select \* from tblUsers where username=". So back in the strings window I limit my breakpoints down to just the ones that have an instance of the string we landed on first. There are only two, and I notice something interesting nearby the second instance. A string "User-Edit.asp" - I try to load this URL "http://localhost:82/User-Edit.asp"

Bingo! I see a screen with \*USERNAMEINPUT\* as the username - I presume this is some sort of place holder. I combine this with the test for UID in the strings above and take a stab in the dark - I use UID as a Query String parameter and set it to 1. "<http://localhost/User-Edit.asp?UID=1>"

No dice, but I did land on a break point which may show me what's happening a bit. I step forward a little bit and wait for a string to appear in the top right pane of the CPU window - eventually it does, right around:
> 005FD39A   . 8B85 60FFFFFF  MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-A0]

The string is in EDX, and I see it's carrying my "UID=1". I wonder... what about SQLi here? I try it. "<http://localhost:82/User-Edit.asp?UID=1%20OR%201=1>"

I see my SQLi seems to be unhindered, so I let the program run through (F9).

I'm greeted with the user-edit page - and I have the admin user (the only user in my case). Reviewing the source of the page, I see it populates the username as well as the password boxes. In my example it appears random - but that's just the password I punched in. Its  in plaintext!

I go ahead and enumerate all of the available .asp pages and continue similar testing on these. Then I contact the vendor as well as cve-assign@mitre.com and these are what was assigned:
> CVE-2012-3820: Multiple SQL Injection: activate.asp –
> SerialNumber field, User-Edit.asp – UID field

> CVE-2012-3821: Unauthorized

And that sums up my first experiences bug hunting.

See you next time and until then, Hack Safe, Hack Legal, but most of all Hack Fun!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
