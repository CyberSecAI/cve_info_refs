        "content": "The blog post details the process of discovering multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Campaign Enterprise 11 software. Specifically, CVE-2012-3820 is mentioned as encompassing SQL injection vulnerabilities in 'activate.asp' (SerialNumber field) and 'User-Edit.asp' (UID field).\n\nRoot cause:\nThe root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization of user-supplied data in the 'activate.asp' and 'User-Edit.asp' pages when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the 'SerialNumber' field in 'activate.asp' and 'UID' parameter in the 'User-Edit.asp' were vulnerable.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities:\nThe primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\nSuccessful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This could lead to:\n  - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive information from the database.\n  - Data modification: Altering or deleting data in the database.\n  - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining administrative access to the application.\n\nAttack vectors:\nThe attack vectors are the HTTP GET requests to the following URLs:\n  - `activate.asp` with a malicious payload in the `SerialNumber` field.  \n  - `User-Edit.asp` with a malicious payload in the `UID` query string parameter.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nThe attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application (i.e. have network access to the application). They also need to craft SQL injection payloads tailored for the specific database and application logic."
