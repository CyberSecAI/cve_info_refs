- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The md5crypt password scrambler, designed in 1995, is now vulnerable due to advancements in hardware, particularly GPU technology, which allows for very fast brute-force attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The algorithm is susceptible to brute-force attacks due to its speed of execution with modern hardware. An attacker can achieve close to 1 million checks per second on COTS GPU hardware, making it feasible to crack 8-character passwords within a couple of days.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The primary impact is the ability for attackers to easily crack passwords protected with the md5crypt algorithm, potentially leading to unauthorized access to systems and data.
- **Attack vectors:** Brute-force attacks using optimized hardware, specifically GPUs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs access to the hashed password and the computational resources (particularly GPUs) to perform the brute-force attack.
