An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

dropdown menu can be used for URL spoofing, other evil

multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*
CVE-2012-3995: Out of bounds read in
IsCSSWordSpacingSpace
\*
CVE-2012-4179: Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn
\*
CVE-2012-4180: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace
\*
CVE-2012-4181: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILAnimationController::DoSample
\*
CVE-2012-4182: Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditRules::WillInsert
\*
CVE-2012-4183: Heap-use-after-free in
DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures
\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-4185: Global-buffer-overflow in
nsCharTraits::length
\*
CVE-2012-4186: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData
\*
CVE-2012-4187: Crash with ASSERTION: insPos too small
\*
CVE-2012-4188: Heap-buffer-overflow in Convolve3x3
\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1351)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2012-3982,
CVE-2012-3988, CVE-2012-3990, CVE-2012-3995, CVE-2012-4179, CVE-2012-4180,
CVE-2012-4181, CVE-2012-4182, CVE-2012-4183, CVE-2012-4185, CVE-2012-4186,
CVE-2012-4187, CVE-2012-4188)

Two flaws in Thunderbird could allow malicious content to bypass intended
restrictions, possibly leading to information disclosure, or Thunderbird
executing arbitrary code. Note that the information disclosure issue could
possibly be combined with other flaws to achieve arbitrary code execution.
(CVE-2012-3986, CVE-2012-3991)

Multiple flaws were found in the location object implementation in
Thunderbird. Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site
scripting attacks, script injection, or spoofing attacks. (CVE-2012-1956,
CVE-2012-3992, CVE-2012-3994)

Two flaws were found in the way Chrome Object Wrappers were implemented.
Malicious content could be used to perform cross-site scripting attacks or
cause Thunderbird to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2012-3993, CVE-2012-4184)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Soroush Dalili,
miaubiz, Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen, Johnny Stenback, Alice White,
moz\_bug\_r\_a4, and Mariusz Mlynski as the original reporters of these
issues.

Note: None of the issues in this advisory can be exploited by a
specially-crafted HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default
for mail messages. They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for
example, when viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 10.0.8 ESR, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3982 CVE-2012-3986 CVE-2012-3990 CVE-2012-3991
    	         CVE-2012-4179 CVE-2012-4180 CVE-2012-4182 CVE-2012-4186
		 CVE-2012-4188

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, Debian's
version of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2012-3982
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
	allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
	corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
	Icedove does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
	A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
	implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
	code via unspecified vectors, related to the
	nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
	Icedove does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
	GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
	the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
	impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
	attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
	service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
	remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
	vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
	memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
	allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
	unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.11-1+squeeze14.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

The issue is also visible in Valgrind which might be easier for debugging purposes. Assuming sec-critical because it seems that we're using a JITChunk (compiled part of a script) after it has been free'd.

Attached patch

[Properly detect IC purging.](attachment.cgi?id=664659&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=664659&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=794025&attachment=664659)

ic::SplatApplyArgs() can cause a GC, but the RecompilationMonitor was only instantiated after that function was called, so the GC was undetected and we referenced an already-freed IC.

Properly detect IC purging.
[Security approval request comment]
How easily can the security issue be deduced from the patch?
Very easily.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Yes.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Patch is the same for all branches.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Can't cause regressions. No testing is needed.

Properly detect IC purging.
sec-approval+ to land this bug now if you can get it landed on all branches (esp Beta) by Friday Sept 28.
Still need separate drivers approval for those branches AFAIK (since part of asking them is so they aren't surprised by landings). The patch looks like it would apply fine back to ESR-10.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=863618#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-06 04:55:26 UTC  ``` Mozilla developer Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be called through script by web pages. This was addressed by adding the existing security checks to these methods.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-77.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Johnny Stenback as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=863618#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:33:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1351 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1351.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=863618#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:53:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1350 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1350.html>   ``` |  |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-74

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:16.0/ rv:10.0.8)

Announced
October 9, 2012
Reporter
Mozilla Developers
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 16
* Firefox ESR 10.0.8
* SeaMonkey 2.13
* Thunderbird 16
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.8

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the
browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we
presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird
and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk
in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

### References

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety
problems and crashes that affect Firefox 15.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=863614#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-10-06 04:32:44 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.  External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-74.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman as the original reporters. These flaws affect Firefox 10.0.7 ESR and Firefox 15.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=863614#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:33:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1351 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1351.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=863614#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 22:53:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1350 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1350.html>   ``` |  |

## Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others

discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3982](/security/CVE-2012-3982), [CVE-2012-3983](/security/CVE-2012-3983), [CVE-2012-3988](/security/CVE-2012-3988), [CVE-2012-3989](/security/CVE-2012-3989),

[CVE-2012-4191](/security/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always

properly handle the  element. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.

([CVE-2012-3984](/security/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the

HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](/security/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform

security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](/security/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be

bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-3991](/security/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a

remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject

script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](/security/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that

allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-3993](/security/CVE-2012-3993), [CVE-2012-3994](/security/CVE-2012-3994), [CVE-2012-4184](/security/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in

Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker

could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context

of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3990](/security/CVE-2012-3990), [CVE-2012-3995](/security/CVE-2012-3995), [CVE-2012-4179](/security/CVE-2012-4179), [CVE-2012-4180](/security/CVE-2012-4180),

[CVE-2012-4181](/security/CVE-2012-4181), [CVE-2012-4182](/security/CVE-2012-4182), [CVE-2012-4183](/security/CVE-2012-4183), [CVE-2012-4185](/security/CVE-2012-4185), [CVE-2012-4186](/security/CVE-2012-4186),

[CVE-2012-4187](/security/CVE-2012-4187), [CVE-2012-4188](/security/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location

object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability

to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4192](/security/CVE-2012-4192), [CVE-2012-4193](/security/CVE-2012-4193))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3982 CVE-2012-3986 CVE-2012-3990 CVE-2012-3991
                 CVE-2012-4179 CVE-2012-4180 CVE-2012-4182 CVE-2012-4186
		 CVE-2012-4188

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, Debian's
version of the Mozilla Firefox web browser.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2012-3982
	Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
	allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
	corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
	Iceweasel does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
	A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
	implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
	code via unspecified vectors, related to the
	nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
	Iceweasel does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
	GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
	the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
	impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
	attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
	service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
	remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
	vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
	A use-after-free vulnerability in the
	nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
	memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the
	nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
	to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
	A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
	allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
	unspecified vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.16-19.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 10.0.8esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

Core :: Networking
For bugs in Mozilla's modular networking library (aka "Netlib" or "Necko".) The networking library supplies the software interface that Mozilla uses to access physical transports (e.g. the Internet and local drives), perform URL resolutions, and handle a variety of networking protocols.

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

ccing julian in case he has ideas. I can take a look after the B2G code fork.
Do we have a sense of what sec-rating this merits?

The security severity will depend on what it's reading and what it plans to use it for next. Could be anything from sec-critical to benign.
More importantly, though, this prevents us from getting a clean ASan run with the default testsuite, which means we can't stand this up as a regular build-test type and catch regressions.

I'm looking at <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/f7cf60910637/netwerk/mime/nsMIMEHeaderParamImpl.cpp#l449>, but can't see anything suspicious...

I started debugging this and the string it is failing on is: filename\*1="\b\a\
The reason is this loop:
> for (valueEnd = str; \*valueEnd; ++valueEnd) {
> if (\*valueEnd == '\\')
> ++valueEnd;
> else if (\*valueEnd == '"')
> break;
> }
With \ at the end, valueEnd is increased twice (stepping over the null-byte) and the loop will go into memory past the string. This is likely to at least disclose memory past the string so I assume this could be sec-high.Keywords: [sec-high](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-high&resolution=---)

Proposed patch, incl test case
+r with one nit: use single quotes as the surrounding quote type, so you don't have to escape double quotes within the test string--easier to read that way.
Thanks :decoder and Julian for the fix!

No need to re-request review for this, you already got r+ with that change :) You can just land this once inbound is open again. Thanks for the fix! It greatly helps our effort to get try green with ASan :)

You need to set an explicit person as the reviewer (probably jduell), or if it is basically the same patch as you got reviewed before you probably don't need a re-review.

Package        : iceape
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3982 CVE-2012-3986 CVE-2012-3990 CVE-2012-3991
                 CVE-2012-4179 CVE-2012-4180 CVE-2012-4182 CVE-2012-4186
                 CVE-2012-4188

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceape, an internet
suite based on Seamonkey:

CVE-2012-3982
        Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine
        allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
        corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
        arbitrary code via unknown vectors.

CVE-2012-3986
        Icedove does not properly restrict calls to DOMWindowUtils
        methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
        access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code.

CVE-2012-3990
        A Use-after-free vulnerability in the IME State Manager
        implementation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
        code via unspecified vectors, related to the
        nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID function.

CVE-2012-3991
        Icedove does not properly restrict JSAPI access to the
        GetProperty function, which allows remote attackers to bypass
        the Same Origin Policy and possibly have unspecified other
        impact via a crafted web site.

CVE-2012-4179
        A use-after-free vulnerability in the
        nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn function allows remote
        attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
        service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4180
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the
        nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace function allows
        remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified
        vectors.

CVE-2012-4182
        A use-after-free vulnerability in the
        nsTextEditRules::WillInsert function allows remote attackers
        to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
        memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4186
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the
        nsWav-eReader::DecodeAudioData function allows remote attackers
        to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-4188
        A heap-based buffer overflow in the Convolve3x3 function
        allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
        unspecified vectors.

Additionally, this update fixes a regression in the patch for
CVE-2012-3959, released in DSA-2554-1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-16.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.10esr-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.10esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.

I wasn't able to reproduce this. Can you figure it out from the stacks, and knowing that the fuzzer was opening and closing windows?

Probably.

 if (mPreviousViewer)
mPreviousViewer->SetBounds(aBounds);
looks suspicious. We call set bounds on the previous viewer, and at least in theory that could
end up doing stuff which sets mPreviousViewer null.

Jesse, want to try this? Though, if reproducing is hard, verifying the
fix can be difficult.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
