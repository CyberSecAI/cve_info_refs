| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20120620-asaipv6  First Published: 2012 June 20 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCua27134](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua27134)     CVE-2012-3058        CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2012-3058        Email      Summary  * Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances (Cisco ASA) and Cisco   Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module (Cisco ASASM) contain a vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated, remote   attacker to cause the reload of the affected device.  Affected Products  * Cisco ASA and Cisco ASASM are affected by this vulnerability. Not all the versions of Cisco ASA Software are affected by this vulnerability. Consult the "Software Versions   and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more information about   the affected version.   Vulnerable ProductsFor specific version information, refer to the "Software Versions and Fixes" section of this advisory.      Cisco ASA and Cisco ASASM contain a vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated, remote   attacker to cause the reload of the affected device.      Cisco ASA Software may be affected by this vulnerability if all the following conditions are present:    + Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM is running in transparent firewall mode   + Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM has IPv6 enabled   + Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM has system logging enabled and the system is configured to log message ID 110003 To verify that the Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM is running in transparent firewall mode, issue the **show firewall** command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA running in transparent firewall mode:  ```   ciscoasa# show firewallFirewall mode: Transparent   ``` IPv6 is not enabled by default. In order to enable IPv6 on a Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM configured in transparent firewall mode at a minimum a link-local   address needs to be configured for IPv6 to operate correctly. If a global address is configured, a   link-local address is automatically configured on each interface.       To verify that the Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM has IPv6 enabled, issue the **show ipv6 interface** command and confirm that the command returns output. The following example shows a Cisco ASA configured with two interfaces (inside and outside) running in transparent firewall mode and IPv6 enabled:    ```   ciscoasa# show ipv6 interfaceoutside is up, line protocol is up  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::219:2fff:fe83:4f42  No global unicast address is configured  Joined group address(es):    ff02::1    ff02::1:ff83:4f42  ICMP error messages limited to one every 100 milliseconds  ICMP redirects are enabled  ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts: 1  ND reachable time is 30000 milliseconds  ND advertised retransmit interval is 1000 milliseconds  Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.inside is up, line protocol is up  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::219:2fff:fe83:4f43  No global unicast address is configured  Joined group address(es):    ff02::1    ff02::1:ff83:4f43  ICMP error messages limited to one every 100 milliseconds  ICMP redirects are enabled  ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts: 1  ND reachable time is 30000 milliseconds  ND advertised retransmit interval is 1000 milliseconds  Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.   ``` Syslog   message ID 110003 is generated when the Cisco ASA is unable to find the next hop on an interface routing table. Additional information   regarding this syslog message can be found in the Cisco ASA System Log   Messages guide at: <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/products_system_message_guides_list.html>.   Logging is not enabled by default on a Cisco ASA; however, when logging   is enabled a Cisco ASA will automatically enable syslog message 110003.      Syslog message 110003 has a default severity level of 6 (informational). Cisco   ASA Software configured for logging at Level 6 or higher (that is Levels 6 through 7) may be vulnerable.   To verify if logging is enabled, issue the **show logging** command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with logging enabled and buffer logging enabled at Level 6 (informational):     ```    ciscoasa# show loggingSyslog logging: enabled    Facility: 20    Timestamp logging: disabled    Standby logging: disabled    Debug-trace logging: disabled    Console logging: disabled    Monitor logging: disabled    Buffer logging: level informational, 2 messages logged    Trap logging: disabled    Permit-hostdown logging: disabled    History logging: disabled    Device ID: disabled    Mail logging: disabled    ASDM logging: disabled    ```      Using a custom message list (created via the **logging list**   command) that includes syslog message 110003, either by severity or by   explicitly including the message ID, is also a vulnerable configuration.         The default severity level of syslog messages can be changed. If the   default severity level of syslog message 110003 is changed and the   device is configured to log to any destination at the new severity   level, the device is vulnerable.Determine the Running Software VersionTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **show version**   command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive   Security Appliance that is running software version 8.4(1):     ```    ciscoasa#show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) Device Manager Version 6.4(1)    ```   Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to   manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is   displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM   window.Information about Cisco PIX Security Appliance Cisco PIX is not affected by the vulnerability described in   this security advisory. Cisco PIX has reached end of maintenance   support. Cisco PIX customers are encouraged to migrate to Cisco ASA. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances (Cisco ASA) and Cisco   Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module (Cisco ASASM) contain a vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated, remote   attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.    **Note:** This vulnerability can only be triggered by IPv6 transit traffic, and affects both Cisco ASA and Cisco ASASM when configured in transparent firewall mode (either single or multiple context mode).      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCua27134](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua27134) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-3058.  Workarounds  * A valid workaround is to prevent the Cisco ASA from generating the syslog message 110003. Use the **no logging message** **110003** command to disable syslog message 110003.  To verify that the message is not being generated issue **show running-configuration logging** command. The following example shows the output of the command when the logging of message 110003 is disabled:  ```   ciscoasa# show run logging[...]no logging message 110003[...]   ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       | **Vulnerability** | **Major Release** | **First Fixed Release** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco ASA IPv6 Packets Denial Of Service Vulnerability | 7.0 | Not Affected |   | 7.1 | Not Affected |   | 7.2 | Not Affected |   | 8.0 | Not Affected |   | 8.1 | Not Affected |   | 8.2 | Not Affected |   | 8.3 | Not Affected |   | 8.41 | 8.4(4.1) |   | 8.5 | 8.5(1.11); Available July 2012 |   | 8.6 | 8.6 (1.3); Available July 2012 |         1This vulnerability was introduced in 8.4(2).

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
