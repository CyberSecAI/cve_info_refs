Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by specific IPv6 transit traffic when the Cisco ASA or ASASM is configured in transparent firewall mode, and when a specific system logging message (ID 110003) is generated due to the device being unable to find the next hop on an interface routing table for the IPv6 traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Cisco ASA and ASASM handle IPv6 traffic in transparent firewall mode, specifically when system logging is enabled for message ID 110003.
- The conditions required to trigger the vulnerability are:
    - Cisco ASA or ASASM is running in transparent firewall mode.
    - IPv6 is enabled on the device.
    - System logging is enabled, and the system is configured to log message ID 110003.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the affected Cisco ASA or ASASM device to reload. This results in a complete disruption of services provided by the firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated. An attacker can send specially crafted IPv6 transit traffic to the vulnerable device. The traffic must cause the device to generate syslog message 110003.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 traffic to the target Cisco ASA or ASASM.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the device.
- No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to send network packets to the device.
