{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Katello installation script did not properly generate the `Application.config.secret_token` value. Instead of generating a unique random token, a static hardcoded value was used as a default.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a hardcoded cryptographic key.",
        "Improper generation of secret token."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could craft a session cookie using the hardcoded `secret_token` and use it to authenticate to the Katello web interface as an arbitrary user, without needing valid credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network attack."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the Katello server. No user interaction is needed."
