Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3426:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2012-3426. The descriptions in the Launchpad bug reports, the Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-1552-1), and the OpenStack Security Advisory (OSSA 2012-010) all explicitly mention CVE-2012-3426 and describe the vulnerabilities associated with it. The github commits mentioned are also directly tied to fixing the issue.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of related issues in OpenStack Keystone's token handling:

   *   **Token Chaining:** Keystone allows new tokens to be created using existing, unexpired tokens. This enables an attacker with a compromised token to indefinitely extend access by repeatedly creating new tokens before the old ones expire.
   *  **Lack of Token Revocation on Password Change:** When a user's password is changed, existing tokens issued prior to the change remain valid.
   *   **Lack of Token Revocation on User Disable:** When a user account is disabled, previously issued tokens for that user remain valid.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   *   **Insecure Token Management:** The vulnerabilities stem from insecure token management practices, where tokens are not properly invalidated when they should be. This leads to unauthorized persistent access.
   *   **Lack of Authorization Checks:**  The system lacked checks to ensure tokens were invalidated when a user's password changed or their account was disabled.
   *   **Token Chaining Issue:** The mechanism allowing tokens to create other tokens effectively bypasses the token expiration time intended to limit the scope of abuse.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   *   **Extended Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who compromises a user's token can maintain access even after the user changes their password or is disabled, if they continuously renew the token before its expiration.
   *   **Data Breach Potential:** With persistent access, attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored within the OpenStack environment.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   *  **Compromised Credentials:** The initial attack vector is through compromised user credentials, allowing the attacker to obtain a valid token.
   *   **Token Chaining:** An attacker uses a valid token to generate new, valid tokens, effectively extending their access beyond the intended lifespan of the initial token.
   *   **Abuse of Valid Tokens:** An attacker with a valid token can continue to access the system even after user account is disabled or has had its password changed.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   *   **Valid Token:** The attacker must obtain a valid, unexpired token, initially, by compromising user credentials.
   *  **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Keystone API to utilize the compromised token and to generate new ones
   * **Authenticated and Authorized User**: The attacker must initially be an authenticated and authorized user.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   The Launchpad bug reports and the associated commits provide detailed examples of how the vulnerabilities could be exploited.
*   The fixes for these vulnerabilities involve invalidating user tokens when a password is changed or an account is disabled and ensuring the original expiry time is carried over when using an existing token to obtain a new token.
*   The issue was categorized as a security hardening issue initially but later treated as a vulnerability, leading to the publication of an OSSA.
* The fixes were backported to the stable/essex branch, and included in the Keystone 2012.1.1 stable update and the Folsom-1 milestone.
