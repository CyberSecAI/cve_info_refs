Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `app_voicemail` module of Asterisk.
- The root cause is a double-free condition, specifically where the `free()` function is called twice on the same memory address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The `close_mailbo()` function, responsible for closing the voicemail box, frees memory associated with `vms->deleted` and `vms->heard` (message status) if messages exist. Under certain conditions (manipulation of the same mailbox by multiple simultaneous calls) this function can be called multiple times resulting in the same memory being freed multiple times. This can lead to memory corruption and a crash.
- The code snippet shows the problematic logic:
```c
if (vms->deleted && last_msg_idx) {
    ast_free(vms->deleted);
}
if (vms->heard && last_msg_idx) {
    ast_free(vms->heard);
}
```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability causes the Asterisk service to crash, leading to a denial of service. This makes the affected PBX system unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Authenticated Sessions:** The vulnerability is exploitable by users who have authenticated access to the voicemail system.
- **Specific Voicemail Manipulation:** The attack involves leaving voicemail messages, logging into the voicemail, and then manipulating the voicemail box through specific actions and commands (like deleting messages, switching between urgent and normal mailboxes). It can also be triggered by multiple simultaneous calls accessing the same mailbox
- **Steps:**
   1. Leave an urgent and a normal message.
   2. Log into voicemail and wait.
   3. Leave another urgent and normal message from another call.
   4. In the voicemail menu press '1' to listen to an urgent message.
   5. Press '7' to delete a message which closes the urgent mailbox and switches to the inbox.
   6. Press '#' to exit.
  - An alternative trigger involves using '4' and '6' to navigate between the urgent and input mailboxes, which also leads to the double free.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user capable of accessing the voicemail system. They need to be able to dial in, record messages, and interact with the voicemail menu.
- They must be able to manipulate the voicemail system in a specific manner as described in the steps.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the same mailbox is accessed and manipulated by two or more callers at nearly the same time.
- The issue is described as a "remote crash vulnerability".
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-415 "Double Free".

**Affected Versions:**
- Asterisk Open Source 1.8.x (prior to 1.8.13.1)
- Asterisk Open Source 10.x (prior to 10.5.2)
- Certified Asterisk 1.8.11-certx (all versions)
