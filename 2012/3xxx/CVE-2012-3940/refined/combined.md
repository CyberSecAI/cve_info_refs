| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.7 |

In some cases, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of a targeted user.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx WRF Player. The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS 27 and WBS 28) are affected by at least one of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:   + T28 client builds prior to T28.4 (28.4)   + T27 client builds prior to T27LDSP32EP10 (27.32.10)To determine the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and navigate to the **Support > Downloads** section via the links on the left side of the page. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page. Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.10 is fixed, build 27.32.11 will also contain the software update. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, such as T27 SP32 EP10. Such an example indicates that the server is running client build 27.32.10.      **Note:** Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The WebEx meeting service is a hosted multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The WRF file format is used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is the application used to play back and edit WebEx WRF recording files, which use the *.wrf* extension. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for stream playback mode). The Cisco WebEx WRF Player can also be manually installed after downloading the application from <http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html> to play back recording files locally (for offline playback mode).      The following table provides the Cisco bug IDs and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers that have been assigned for the vulnerabilities in this advisory:      | ****Title**** | ****CVE ID**** | ****Cisco Bug ID**** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco WebEx Recording Format Player Buffer Overflow Vulnerability | CVE-2012-3936 | CSCua40962 |   | Cisco WebEx Recording Format Player Buffer Overflow Vulnerability | CVE-2012-3937 | CSCtz72967 |   | Cisco WebEx Recording Format Player Buffer Overflow Vulnerability | CVE-2012-3938 | CSCtz73583 |   | Cisco WebEx WRF Player Memory Corruption Vulnerability | CVE-2012-3939 | CSCua61331 |   | Cisco WebEx Recording Format Player Buffer Overflow Vulnerability | CVE-2012-3940 | CSCtz72958 |   | Cisco WebEx Recording Format Player Heap Overflow Vulnerability | CVE-2012-3941 | CSCtz72850 |         Exploitation of the vulnerabilities may cause the Cisco WebEx WRF Player application to crash or, in some cases, result in remote code execution.      To exploit one of these vulnerabilities, the Cisco WebEx WRF Player application must open a malicious WRF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using e-mail) or by directing a user to a malicious web page. Users who are attending a WebEx meeting cannot trigger the vulnerabilities.  Workarounds  * While there are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities detailed in this advisory, it is possible to remove all WebEx software completely from a system using the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller (for Apple Mac users) available at <http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html>. Removal of WebEx software from a Linux or UNIX-based system can be accomplished by following the steps in the WebEx knowledge base help article at the following link: [https://support.webex.com/MyAccountWeb/knowledgeBase.do?root=Tools&parent=Knowledge&articleId=WBX28548&txtSearchQuery=uninstall%20linux#](https://support.webex.com/MyAccountWeb/knowledgeBase.do?root=Tools&parent=Knowledge&articleId=WBX28548&txtSearchQuery=uninstall%20linux).  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance providers.       The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS 27 and WBS 28) correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:    + Client builds 28.4 (T28.4)   + Client builds 27.32.10 (T27LDSP32EP10) Client builds prior to T27 SP32 have reached end of support; to obtain fixed software please upgrade to the latest version.  To determine the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and navigate to the **Support > Downloads** section via the links on the left side of the page. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page. Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.10 is fixed, build 27.32.11 will also contain the software update.  The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the Cisco WebEx WRF Player are all affected. If the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was manually installed, users must download the latest version from <http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html> and install it.  Users can determine whether a Cisco WebEx WRF Player is affected by these vulnerabilities by manually verifying the installed version. To do so, users can examine the file version and determine whether it contains the fixed code.  **Microsoft Windows**  Five dynamic link libraries (DLLs) were updated on the Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. These files are in the C:\Program Files\WebEx\Record Playback folder or the C:\Program Files (x86)\Webex\Record Player folder. The version number of a DLL can be obtained by browsing the Record Playback directory in Windows Explorer, right-clicking the filename, and choosing **Properties**. The Version or Details tab of the Properties page provides details on the library version. The following table provides the first fixed version for each DLL. If the installed versions are equal to or greater than the versions provided in the table, the system is not vulnerable.       | **Client Build** | **Cisco DLL Filename** | **DLL File Versions** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 28.4 | atas32.dll | 28,400,12,629 |   | 28.4 | atas32\_lite.dll | 28,400,112,629 |   | 28.4 | atrecply.dll | 2028,1204,600,700 |   | 28.4 | atrpui.dll | 2028,1204,700,1300 |   | 28.4 | atdl2006 | 1028,1204,500,2400 |   | 27.32.10 | atas32.dll | 2,6,32,4 |   | 27.32.10 | atas32\_lite.dll | 2,6,32,104 |   | 27.32.10 | atrecply.dll | 2027,1232,610,2600 |   | 27.32.10 | atrpui.dll | 2027,1232, 610,2600 |   | 27.32.10 | atdl2006 | 1027,1232,710,1200 |       **Apple Mac**  Four package bundles were updated on the Apple Mac OS platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. This file is in each user's home directory and can be accessed from ~/Library/Application Support/WebEx Folder/924. The version can be obtained by browsing to the appropriate folder in Finder and control-clicking the filename. When the menu is displayed, choose **show package contents** and then double-click the *Info.plist* file. The version number is shown at the bottom of the displayed table. The following table provides the first fixed version for each package bundle.
