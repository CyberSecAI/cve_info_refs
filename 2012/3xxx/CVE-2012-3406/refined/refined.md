4. Relevant content:

- Root cause of vulnerability:
  - The formatted printing functionality in glibc did not properly restrict the use of `alloca()`, which resulted in an undersized buffer allocation and a potential stack corruption. This could bypass FORTIFY_SOURCE protections.
  -  Incorrect use of extend_alloca() in formatted printing leading to desynchronization within the buffer size handling. This could also bypass FORTIFY_SOURCE.
  - The formatted printing functionality in glibc did not properly honor the size of a structure when calculating the amount of memory to allocate. This can lead to an undersized buffer allocation and subsequent stack corruption

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Format string vulnerability leading to a potential stack-based buffer overflow.
  - Incorrect use of alloca() and extend_alloca().
  - Improper size calculations.
  - Bypass of FORTIFY_SOURCE protections.

- Impact of exploitation:
  - Potential stack-based buffer overflow.
  - Denial of Service (crash).
  - Arbitrary code execution via FORTIFY_SOURCE bypass.

- Attack vectors:
  - A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted sequence of format specifiers.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to control the format string passed to a vulnerable function using glibc formatted printing functions.

5. Additional notes:
   - The content provides more detail than the official CVE description.
   - The vulnerability is related to glibc's formatted printing function.
   - Exploitation might lead to arbitrary code execution if FORTIFY_SOURCE protections are bypassed
