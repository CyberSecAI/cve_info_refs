{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2012-3490": {
      "description": "Certain functions in Condor (my_popenv_impl and my_spawnv in src/condor_utils/my_popen.cpp) did not check the return value of setuid and similar function calls. As a result, the subprocess could possibly be created with root privileges instead of those of the intended user.",
      "root_cause": "The code in `src/condor_utils/my_popen.cpp` did not check the return values of `setuid`, `setgroups`, and `setgid` system calls.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing check on return value of security critical system calls"
      ],
      "impact": "A subprocess could be created with root privileges instead of the intended user's privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": "Exploitable in the code path where the vulnerable code (my_popenv_impl and my_spawnv) is called in the source code of Condor.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path and exploit the missing checks on the system call return values. The vulnerability is only exploitable if the VMware support is compiled in."
