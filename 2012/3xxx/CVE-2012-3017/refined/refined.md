- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation when processing network data, specifically malformed HTTP communication or malformed IP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability. This is classified as CWE-20: Improper Input Validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can cause the affected SIMATIC S7-400 CPUs to enter a defect mode, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. Attackers can send malformed HTTP communication or malformed IP packets to the affected CPUs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected devices. No special privileges or user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
