SSA-617264: Multiple Security Vulnerabilities in SIMATIC S7-400 V5
PN CPUs

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

2012-07-30
2020-04-13
V1.1

SUMMARY

When receiving malformed network data, SIMATIC S7-400 V5 PN CPUs may go into defect mode. This
would allow attackers to perform a Denial-of-Service attack on the CPUs.

Siemens will not publish a ﬁx for this vulnerability as this product version is discontinued since October
2011 [1]. Version V6 is not affected by these speciﬁc problems. [1] https://support.industry.siemens.com/

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Access to the production network in which the devices are deployed must be controlled and

minimized as much as possible.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products in the SIMATIC S7-400 CPU family have been designed for process control in industrial
environments. They are used worldwide, e.g. in the automotive industry, mechanical equipment manu-
facture, warehousing systems, building engineering, steel industry, power generation and distribution,
pharmaceuticals, food and beverages industry, or chemical industry.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2012-3017

A Denial-of-Service can be caused via malformed HTTP communication or malformed IP packets.
