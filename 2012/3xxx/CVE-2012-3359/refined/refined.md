Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-3359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The luci web interface, part of the Conga cluster management system, was storing usernames and passwords within session cookies. These cookies were set with the name `__ac`. The values in the cookie were not opaque identifiers but rather contained a base64 encoded string of the user's username and password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** Storing sensitive information like usernames and passwords directly in cookies is a major security flaw.
*   **Lack of Server-Side Session Management:** Session management relied primarily on client-side JavaScript, and did not properly enforce inactivity timeouts on the server.
*   **Exposure through Session Cookies:**  The use of cookies to store authentication credentials made them vulnerable to interception and theft.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gained access to a valid `__ac` cookie could bypass authentication and log in as the compromised user.
*   **Account Takeover:** By obtaining a user's cookie, an attacker could gain complete control of that user's session, allowing them to perform any actions the legitimate user could.
*   **Bypass Session Timeouts:**  The session timeout feature, which should have terminated the session after a period of inactivity, could be bypassed, as the session was validated through the cookie, not a server-side mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal session cookies through various means:
    *   Network sniffing/eavesdropping on unencrypted connections
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
    *   Accessing user's local storage through malware or other attack methods
*   **Replay Attacks**: Once a cookie is obtained, it can be replayed repeatedly to gain access until the cookie expires.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to obtain a valid `__ac` session cookie. This could be achieved by:
    *   Having network access to the communication between the user's browser and the server (e.g., man-in-the-middle attack).
    *   Compromising the user's machine directly
    *   Exploiting any vulnerability allowing access to cookies (e.g. XSS)
    *   Social engineering the user into revealing their session cookie

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by changing how sessions are handled. Usernames and passwords are no longer stored in cookies, cookies now store an opaque identifier for server-side session, and inactivity timeouts are enforced on the server-side.
*   This issue is related to CVE-2013-7347 which refers to the session inactivity timeout vulnerability.
