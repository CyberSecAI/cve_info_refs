Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Cisco Application Control Engine (ACE) software's handling of administrative user logins when operating in multicontext mode. Specifically, the issue occurs when two or more contexts (virtual instances) are configured with the same management IP address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **IP Address Overlap:** The core vulnerability is the ability to configure multiple contexts with the same management IP address.
- **Incorrect Context Login:**  When an administrator attempts to access the management IP address, they might be logged into an unintended context instead of the desired one.
- **Authentication Bypass:** While not a full bypass, an attacker with valid credentials for an unintended context can potentially gain access to that context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** An administrator could be logged into an unintended context.
- **Potential Data Breach/Manipulation:** If the attacker has valid credentials for the unintended context, they can potentially modify the configuration. 

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is launched by accessing the management interface of the Cisco ACE device over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the management interface of the affected Cisco ACE.
- **Valid Credentials:**  The attacker needs valid login credentials for at least one of the Cisco ACE contexts that share a management IP address.
- **Multicontext Mode:** The Cisco ACE device must be running in multicontext mode.
- **Overlapping IP Addresses:** The vulnerable condition requires the configuration of multiple ACE contexts using the same IP address.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when multiple contexts share the same management IP.
- The CVSS score is 7.1 (base) and 5.9 (temporal)
- The vulnerability was found during the troubleshooting of a customer case.
- The fix is available in Cisco ACE software versions A4(2.3) and A5(1.1).
- A workaround is to configure a unique management IP address for each context.
