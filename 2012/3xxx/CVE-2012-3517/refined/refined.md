Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3517:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in Tor's handling of failed DNS requests which can lead to a double-free and use-after-free condition. Specifically, when a DNS request fails, the `dns_resolve` function attempts to cancel the pending resolve and free the connection. However, the `dns_cancel_pending_resolve` function also frees the connection under certain conditions, leading to a double-free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double free: The same memory is freed twice, leading to memory corruption.
- Use-after-free: After the memory is freed, the program attempts to access it again leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The double-free and use-after-free vulnerabilities can cause the Tor process to crash, disrupting the service for clients relying on the compromised relay.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by issuing a specially crafted DNS request to a Tor exit relay.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a Tor exit relay. This implies the attacker can send crafted DNS requests.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication or access to the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in Tor version 0.2.2.38.
- The vulnerability is described as a "rare race condition" which can make it less easy to exploit.
- The bug is identified by ticket #6480 on the Tor project's issue tracker.

In summary, CVE-2012-3517 describes a remotely triggerable DoS vulnerability in Tor caused by a double-free issue in DNS request handling.
