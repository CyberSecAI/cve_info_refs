Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-3361 in OpenStack Nova. The initial fix did not properly handle symlinks within guest images that were only readable by the root user. This allowed for a symlink attack, where a malicious user could craft a guest image containing such symlinks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Fix:** The core weakness is the insufficient remediation of the original CVE-2012-3361, specifically in how paths were canonicalized and checked. The initial fix failed to account for file permissions within the guest image.
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability allows the use of symlinks within guest images to manipulate the host filesystem. Specifically, symlinks within a directory readable only by root could bypass the initial fix.
*   **Insufficient Path Validation:** The `_join_and_check_path_within_fs()` function, intended to prevent path traversal attacks, was bypassed when the check was done with the privileges of the nova user and not the root user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An authenticated user can overwrite arbitrary files on the compute node's filesystem.
*   **Arbitrary File Injection:** In Essex and later versions of OpenStack with the API enabled and using a libvirt-based hypervisor, it was possible for an attacker to inject files into arbitrary locations on the host filesystem.
*   **Potential Full Compromise:** Exploitation could lead to a full compromise of the compute node.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest Image:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious guest image. This image contains symlinks, placed inside a directory that is only readable by root inside the guest, that target files on the host system.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment, able to request the creation of a server based on the malicious image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **OpenStack Account:** The attacker must have a valid account within the OpenStack environment to create a virtual instance.
*   **Image Creation:** The attacker must be able to create or modify a guest image.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenStack API to launch the crafted instance.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `virt/disk/api.py` file of OpenStack Nova.
*   The function `_join_and_check_path_within_fs()` is responsible for canonicalizing and checking paths during file injection.
*   The fix involves running the path canonicalization with root privileges to validate paths correctly using `readlink -nm`.
*   Patches were released for Diablo, Essex, and Folsom versions of Nova, requiring an update to the sudoers file to include the readlink command.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as a high severity issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix included using `readlink -m` to resolve symlinks and perform the path check with root privileges.
*   This CVE was initially handled as an errata to OSSA-2012-008 (CVE-2012-3361) but later assigned its own CVE (CVE-2012-3447) to ensure users are aware of the complete fix.
