{
  "CVE-2012-3544": {
    "Description": "When processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding, Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This allows a client to perform a limited DOS by streaming an unlimited amount of data to the server.",
    "Root cause": "Tomcat did not limit the extensions included in chunked transfer encoding.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of chunked transfer encoding extensions"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service by streaming an unlimited amount of data to the server, causing resource exhaustion.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted request using chunked transfer encoding with unlimited extensions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tomcat server."
