Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3382:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the path within the error popup of the "Forbidden extension" filter in the Mono System.Web library. Specifically, the path was not properly sanitized before being displayed in the error message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is an XSS vulnerability. By injecting malicious code into the path, an attacker can cause the browser of the user viewing the error page to execute arbitrary scripts.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system failed to sanitize user-controlled input (the path) before including it in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when they view the error page. This could potentially lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Phishing attacks
    - Defacement of the webpage
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website
- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive information from the user's session or browser could be accessed or leaked to the attacker through the executed scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through manipulating the request path to include malicious script. The 'Forbidden extension' filter would reject the request but then display the (maliciously crafted) path in the error message.
- This could be achieved by crafting a URL with malicious content within the path component. For example, a URL like `/path/<script>alert("XSS")</script>/file.dll` could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request that will trigger the error page.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated; the vulnerability is triggered by the system when a forbidden file extension is requested and the path is included in the resulting error page.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL path to include the malicious content.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is in `System.Web/HttpForbiddenHandler.cs`
- The fix involves HTML encoding the path before it is displayed in the error message. Specifically the change is:

 				description);
 		}
```
- The change uses `HttpUtility.HtmlEncode` to prevent the browser from interpreting the path as HTML.

**Summary:**
CVE-2012-3382 is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Mono System.Web library. It occurs because the system does not properly sanitize the request path before displaying it in an error message.  An attacker can exploit this by including malicious script in the request path, which will then be executed by the user's browser when the error page is displayed. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, phishing attacks, and more.
