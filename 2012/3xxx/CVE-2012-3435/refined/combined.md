Subject: Zabbix SQL injection flaw (CVE request)

Could a CVE be assigned to this please?

An SQL injection flaw was found in Zabbix, where input passed via the
"itemid" parameter to popup_bitem.php is not properly sanitized before
being used in an SQL query.

The report was against version 2.0.1, but the upstream bug report [1]
indicates this also affects 1.8.x.  Upstream has patched [2] this, and
there is a potential patch for 1.8.x [3].

[1] <https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-5348>
[2] <http://git.zabbixzone.com/zabbix2.0/.git/commit/333a3a5542ba8a2c901c24b7bf5440f41f1f4f54>

Package        : zabbix
Vulnerability  : SQL injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3435
Debian Bug     : 683273

It was discovered that Zabbix, a network monitoring solution, does not
properly validate user input used as a part of an SQL query. This may
allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands (SQL
injection) and possibly escalate privileges.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8.2-1squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.0.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](#c0)  Sean Amoss (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2012-07-27 20:43:51 UTC  ``` From the Red Hat bug at $URL:  'An SQL injection flaw was found in Zabbix, where input passed via the "itemid" parameter to popup_bitem.php is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.  The report was against version 2.0.1, but the upstream bug report [1] indicates this also affects 1.8.x.  Upstream has patched [2] this, and there is a potential patch for 1.8.x [3].'  [1] <https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-5348> [2] <http://git.zabbixzone.com/zabbix2.0/.git/commit/333a3a5542ba8a2c901c24b7bf5440f41f1f4f54> [3] <https://gist.github.com/3181678> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matthew Marlowe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-07-27 21:49:04 UTC  ``` I've requested info on the zabbix irc channel if the upstream plans to release 2.0.2 as an urgent fix.  If not, it appears that 2.0.2rc2 includes the fix so we can commit and stablize that as alternative path.  I'll have to review the 1.8.x patch to see if we want to apply that.  I haven't heard anything about a new 1.8.x release being scheduled.  Thanks for catching this bug.  I've sent an inquiry to verify how zabbix is notifying distros of security vulnerabilities. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Matthew Marlowe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-07-30 09:12:29 UTC  ``` Per Zabbix Devs - Official 2.0.2 release will be out early this week.  I'll bump it and remove the earlier 2.0.x ebuilds when it comes out.  No word yet on whether a new 1.8.x release is scheduled. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Matthew Marlowe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-01 14:18:33 UTC  ``` 1.8.15 should be released soon with fix for 1.8.x releases.  2.0.2 was released today - bump in CVS.  I'll want to do more testing and incorporate other bug fixes in an r1 release, but for the time being it has the security patch, is marked for testing arches, and I've removed all older 2.0.x ebuilds.  None of the prior 2.0.x releases have yet reached stable status.  When 1.8.15 is released, it will become the new stable and all older 1.8.x ebuilds will be removed. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2012-08-17 12:00:27 UTC  ``` CVE-2012-3435 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2012-3435>):   SQL injection vulnerability in frontends/php/popup_bitem.php in Zabbix   1.8.15rc1 and earlier, and 2.x before 2.0.2rc1, allows remote attackers to   execute arbitrary SQL commands via the itemid parameter. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Matthew Marlowe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-21 15:04:35 UTC  ``` 1.8.15 and 2.0.2-r1 are in tree. Neither are ready yet to be declared stable. Older ebuilds have been removed - to my knowledge nothing depends on Zabbix being stable. With a little more testing, we should be able to stabilize 1.8.15 however it was just released yesterday so I'll want to wait at least a few days to ensure it didn't introduce any obvious bugs. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-21 16:28:24 UTC  ``` Ok, but we should not wait too long. Now that previous stable versions are gone stable users will have issues running 'emerge --update' methinks. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-25 17:27:32 UTC  ``` Matthew, ok to stabilize now? Thanks. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Matthew Marlowe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-26 21:16:19 UTC  ``` It builds fine here and I haven't seen any new bugs since we bumped 1.8.15, so sure - let's go ahead and stabilize it so that those currently on stable have something secure to switch to. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-27 01:25:07 UTC  ``` Ok, thanks.  Arches, please test and mark stable: =net-analyzer/zabbix-1.8.15 Target keywords : "amd64 x86" ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-30 08:43:54 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-08-30 21:17:41 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2012-08-30 21:18:31 UTC  ``` security, please vote. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-08-31 19:03:50 UTC  ``` Thanks, folks. GLSA Vote: yes. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2012-12-16 21:57:12 UTC  ``` Added to existing GLSA request. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Matthew Marlowe (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-12-17 00:11:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=428372#c14)) > Added to existing GLSA request.  I'm not seeing any information on a new vulnerability here... There are references to newer versions in title but CVE-2012-3435 was resolved prior. Which CVE should I be looking at? ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2013-11-25 17:53:49 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201311-15 at <http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-201311-15.xml> by GLSA coordinator Sergey Popov (pinkbyte). ``` |  |
