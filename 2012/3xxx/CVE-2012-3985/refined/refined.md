## Analysis of CVE-2012-3985

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a violation of the HTML5 specifications regarding `document.domain` behavior in Mozilla products (Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird).
- Specifically, when a page sets a new `document.domain`, it should only have access to windows within that new domain. However, the observed behavior allowed pages to retain access to windows from their initial origin, in addition to the new `document.domain`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect implementation of the `document.domain` security policy
- Failure to properly isolate scripts based on the effective script origin.
- The vulnerability enables cross-origin access, which should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks: An attacker could potentially leverage this flaw to execute scripts in the context of another website.
- Unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A malicious website can exploit this flaw.
- A multi-frame scenario where document.domain is used to grant access to frames with different origins.
- An attacker injects script into a page that has set document.domain and uses it to access a different origin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious website.
- The target website or application must rely on the flawed document.domain behavior for security.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject and execute JavaScript.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by security researcher Collin Jackson.
- The bug report mentions that the issue was a deliberate decision when the compartment system was initially implemented, where document.domain changes could only drop security restrictions and not introduce them.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves recomputing cross-compartment wrappers when `document.domain` is set.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 16, SeaMonkey 2.13, and Thunderbird 16.
- The bug report includes a detailed discussion of the fix and code changes related to the resolution of the issue.
- This issue is also present in Thunderbird, and while scripting is disabled in emails, it remains a risk in browser-like contexts within those products.
- The vulnerability was classified as "sec-moderate" with a "sg:high" impact against sites using `document.domain`.
