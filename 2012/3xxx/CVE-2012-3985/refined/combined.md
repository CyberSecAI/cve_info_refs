# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-76

## Continued access to initial origin after setting document.domain

Announced
October 9, 2012
Reporter
Collin Jackson
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 16
* SeaMonkey 2.13
* Thunderbird 16

### Description

Security researcher **Collin Jackson** reported a violation of
the HTML5 specifications for `document.domain` behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a new
`document.domain` but the observed violation allowed pages to retain
access to windows from the page's initial origin in addition to the new
`document.domain`. This could potentially lead to cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

The HTML5 spec requires that browsers raise a SECURITY\_ERR exception when members of the Window object (e.g. localStorage) are accessed by scripts that have a different effective script origin. Firefox allows access by scripts that have the same origin OR the same effective script origin.
Here's a scenario where the new behavior has an observable security impact:
<https://attacker.cmu.edu/> wants to access the localStorage of <https://weblogin.cmu.edu/>. Assume that there exists a page at <https://help.weblogin.cmu.edu/> that sets document.domain = 'cmu.edu' and that <https://weblogin.cmu.edu/> sets its document.domain to 'weblogin.cmu.edu'.
In Chrome/Safari/IE8, I claim that the attacker can't do it. They can inject script into the one help.weblogin.cmu.edu page that set document.domain to 'cmu.edu' but this page can't script other help.weblogin.cmu.edu pages nor can it script weblogin.cmu.edu.
In Firefox 4, the attack works. The frame hierarchy looks like this:
<https://attacker.cmu.edu/>
---> <https://help.weblogin.cmu.edu/>
---> <https://help.weblogin.cmu.edu/blah>
---> <https://weblogin.cmu.edu/>
The top frame can script the second frame by setting document.domain to 'cmu.edu', the second frame can script the third due to Firefox's non-standard access check, the third frame can script the fourth by setting its document.domain to 'weblogin.cmu.edu'
There may be less contrived scenarios; this is what I could come up with after thinking about it for a few minutes. I'm setting the security flag on this bug because I haven't thought through all the ramifications of the new origin enforcement behavior, but it's fine to clear it if you feel the risk is low.
Incidentally, this attack also worked in IE7, but for a different reason. IE7 allows 'help.weblogin.cmu.edu' to set its document.domain to 'weblogin.cmu.edu' after setting it to 'cmu.edu'. This was fixed in IE8, which now prohibits setting document.domain to a longer value than its current value.
<http://www.adambarth.com/papers/2009/barth-weinberger-song.pdf> has a great explanation of how to do the HTML5 script access check quickly. The key is to get the access check down to a single pointer comparison in the common case.

I believe this was a purposeful decision when the current compartment system was implemented. The reasoning was that if two pages were once same-origin then making them different origins at a later time doesn't buy you much because you could have already injected whatever you want from the one page into the other (e.g. an onmessage handler that evals the passed-in string). The effect is that document.domain changes can \_drop\_ security restrictions in Gecko 2.0 but not \_introduce\_ them, which is what this bug seems to be about.
That reasoning does fall down in the example described in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=655649#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Script access checks should use effective script origin, not origin"), I think: there is no point in time when <https://help.weblogin.cmu.edu/> can both inject script into <https://help.weblogin.cmu.edu/blah> and have script injected from <https://attacker.cmu.edu/> in a system which allows document.domain to introduce security restrictions.Component: Security: CAPS → XPConnectQA Contact: caps → xpconnect

Are you planning to propose this new security model for the web to the HTML working group? If the working group decides to keep the current model, are you planning to continue to implement a non-standards compliant security model? That seems very bad for the web.

I can't speak for Mozilla's strategy, but we rarely intentionally diverge from standards, except if the standard is clearly wrong and there is consensus by implementers to ignore it. It might be worth discussing this change with the WG but for now I don't think anyone assumes that the current model is clearly wrong. Whether this is really that bad for the web I am a bit doubtful about. Extensive document.domain is not all that common, and it will likely get less over time. We are currently plotting out our approach to fix this. We will either lazily split compartments (brain transplant of document graphs), or use zones to keep each window in its own compartment.

Yeah, there was a bit of "laziness" on our part in making this decision. In particular, when we were implementing the original compartments stuff, we couldn't fix this bug as filed in an easy way (lazily splitting compartments wasn't possible until just before Firefox 4). We're definitely planning on fixing things to revoke access on document.domain setting.

As broken as document.domain is in the first place it's not a good idea to change its historical behavior. That's just laying traps for unwary web app developers to fall into.
There's a reason the document.domain spec doesn't allow pages to re-lengthen document.domain back to the original domain once it's been truncated. Once a page has changed its document.domain it's tainted and shouldn't be allowed to spread that taint by rejoining its initial origin.

--> Andreas because it sounds like he needs to make a call on which approach to take.
We've diverged from the spec and this can put some sites at risk, we need to fix it. Seems unlikely to be fixed safely in Firefox 5 which is almost done, but we'd like to get this in Firefox 6.Assignee: nobody → gal

From a code standpoint, the safest milestone is either Firefox 7 or 8. We're targeting compartment-per-window for Firefox 7, which makes the fix for this bug a lot easier (brain transplanting proxies is always safer than brain transplanting wrapped natives).

Given Blake's comment above we won't be able to fix this for 6, tracking for 7, but I'm guessing the change will be invasive enough to port there too, so this might be pushed further...

While you're here, can you change this to a CompartmentsIter?

Yay! Can you put a line break after the assertion? I think it deserves its own paragraph.
Also, can you rip out the junk in proxy\_TraceObject that deals with the case where this assertion fails (the |if (!p) {...}| code and the comment)?

Well, CompartmentsWithPrincipals doesn't call hold on its principals, and SingleCompartment doesn't root it's compartment in any way. I'll add a comment and make that more explicit.

I was going to wait to land the whole stack until Blake does his set of reviews, but gabor wants to use the CompartmentFilter machinery in the earlier patches. So I addressed billm's comments and landed those to m-i:

I feel like this belongs more in nsHTMLDocument rather than the principal itself (which is mostly clear of JS stuff)...
Looking at mxr, it seems like the only caller of nsIPrincipal::SetDomain is the document, so if you feel strongly about keeping this here, I guess that's OK.
Also, do we not need to enter request here or enter compartment?

IMO it should live in SetDomain, since this is now our implementation of document.domain semantics. Doing SetDomain without doing the transplant results in incorrect behavior, so it seems like we should keep it there rather than adding a comment in the IDL saying "NB: this actually doesn't work unless you do this other thing as well".
> Also, do we not need to enter request here or enter compartment?
Aren't requests deprecated with single-threaded runtime? Or am I terribly misinformed? It's also not clear why we'd need to enter a compartment, here. Can you explain?

An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

dropdown menu can be used for URL spoofing, other evil

multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*
CVE-2012-3995: Out of bounds read in
IsCSSWordSpacingSpace
\*
CVE-2012-4179: Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn
\*
CVE-2012-4180: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace
\*
CVE-2012-4181: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILAnimationController::DoSample
\*
CVE-2012-4182: Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditRules::WillInsert
\*
CVE-2012-4183: Heap-use-after-free in
DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures
\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-4185: Global-buffer-overflow in
nsCharTraits::length
\*
CVE-2012-4186: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData
\*
CVE-2012-4187: Crash with ASSERTION: insPos too small
\*
CVE-2012-4188: Heap-buffer-overflow in Convolve3x3
\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |

| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others

discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3982](/security/CVE-2012-3982), [CVE-2012-3983](/security/CVE-2012-3983), [CVE-2012-3988](/security/CVE-2012-3988), [CVE-2012-3989](/security/CVE-2012-3989),

[CVE-2012-4191](/security/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always

properly handle the  element. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.

([CVE-2012-3984](/security/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the

HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](/security/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform

security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](/security/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be

bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-3991](/security/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a

remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject

script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](/security/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that

allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-3993](/security/CVE-2012-3993), [CVE-2012-3994](/security/CVE-2012-3994), [CVE-2012-4184](/security/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in

Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker

could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context

of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3990](/security/CVE-2012-3990), [CVE-2012-3995](/security/CVE-2012-3995), [CVE-2012-4179](/security/CVE-2012-4179), [CVE-2012-4180](/security/CVE-2012-4180),

[CVE-2012-4181](/security/CVE-2012-4181), [CVE-2012-4182](/security/CVE-2012-4182), [CVE-2012-4183](/security/CVE-2012-4183), [CVE-2012-4185](/security/CVE-2012-4185), [CVE-2012-4186](/security/CVE-2012-4186),

[CVE-2012-4187](/security/CVE-2012-4187), [CVE-2012-4188](/security/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location

object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability

to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4192](/security/CVE-2012-4192), [CVE-2012-4193](/security/CVE-2012-4193))
