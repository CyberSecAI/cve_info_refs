circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

CVE-2012-1971: Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse
Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew Sutherland, and
Jason Smith reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 14.
\*
CVE-2012-1970: Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse
Ruderman, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel
Holbert reported memory safety problems and crashes that
affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 14.
\*
MFSA 2012-58: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free issues using the Address Sanitizer
tool. Many of these issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution.
o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLEditor::CollapseAdjacentTextNodes CVE-2012-1972 o
Heap-use-after-free in nsObjectLoadingContent::LoadObject
CVE-2012-1973 o Heap-use-after-free in
gfxTextRun::CanBreakLineBefore CVE-2012-1974 o
Heap-use-after-free in PresShell::CompleteMove
CVE-2012-1975 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLSelectElement::SubmitNamesValues CVE-2012-1976 o
Heap-use-after-free in
MediaStreamGraphThreadRunnable::Run() CVE-2012-3956 o
Heap-buffer-overflow in nsBlockFrame::MarkLineDirty
CVE-2012-3957 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLEditRules::DeleteNonTableElements CVE-2012-3958 o
Heap-use-after-free in nsRangeUpdater::SelAdjDeleteNode
CVE-2012-3959 o Heap-use-after-free in
mozSpellChecker::SetCurrentDictionary CVE-2012-3960 o
Heap-use-after-free in RangeData::~RangeData CVE-2012-3961
o Bad iterator in text runs CVE-2012-3962 o use after free
in js::gc::MapAllocToTraceKind CVE-2012-3963 o
Heap-use-after-free READ 8 in gfxTextRun::GetUserData
CVE-2012-3964
\*
MFSA 2012-59 / CVE-2012-1956: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that it is possible to shadow the
location object using Object.defineProperty. This could be
used to confuse the current location to plugins, allowing
for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-60 / CVE-2012-3965: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a page opens a new tab,
a subsequent window can then be opened that can be
navigated to about:newtab, a chrome privileged page. Once
about:newtab is loaded, the special context can potentially
be used to escalate privilege, allowing for arbitrary code
execution on the local system in a maliciously crafted
attack.
\*
MFSA 2012-61 / CVE-2012-3966: Security researcher
Frederic Hoguin reported two related issues with the
decoding of bitmap (.BMP) format images embedded in icon
(.ICO) format files. When processing a negative "height"
header value for the bitmap image, a memory corruption can
be induced, allowing an attacker to write random memory and
cause a crash. This crash may be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-62: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover two WebGL issues. The
first issue is a use-after-free when WebGL shaders are
called after being destroyed. The second issue exposes a
problem with Mesa drivers on Linux, leading to a
potentially exploitable crash.
o
use after free, webgl fragment shader deleted
by accessor CVE-2012-3968
o
stack scribbling with 4-byte values choosable
among a few values, when using more than 16 sampler
uniforms, on Mesa, with all drivers CVE-2012-3967
\*
MFSA 2012-63: Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used
the Address Sanitizer tool to find two issues involving
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The first issue is a
buffer overflow in Gecko's SVG filter code when the sum of
two values is too large to be stored as a signed 32-bit
integer, causing the function to write past the end of an
array. The second issue is a use-after-free when an element
with a "requiredFeatures" attribute is moved between
documents. In that situation, the internal representation
of the "requiredFeatures" value could be freed prematurely.
Both issues are potentially exploitable.
o
Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsSVGFEMorphologyElement::Filter CVE-2012-3969
o
Heap-use-after-free in nsTArray\_base::Length()
CVE-2012-3970
\*
MFSA 2012-64 / CVE-2012-3971: Using the Address
Sanitizer tool, Mozilla security researcher Christoph Diehl
discovered two memory corruption issues involving the
Graphite 2 library used in Mozilla products. Both of these
issues can cause a potentially exploitable crash. These
problems were fixed in the Graphite 2 library, which has
been updated for Mozilla products.
\*
MFSA 2012-65 / CVE-2012-3972: Security research
Nicolas Gregoire used the Address Sanitizer tool to
discover an out-of-bounds read in the format-number feature
of XSLT, which can cause inaccurate formatting of numbers
and information leakage. This is not directly exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-66 / CVE-2012-3973: Mozilla security
researcher Mark Goodwin discovered an issue with the
Firefox developer tools' debugger. If remote debugging is
disabled, but the experimental HTTPMonitor extension has
been installed and enabled, a remote user can connect to
and use the remote debugging service through the port used
by HTTPMonitor. A remote-enabled flag has been added to
resolve this problem and close the port unless debugging is
explicitly enabled.
\*
MFSA 2012-67 / CVE-2012-3974: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa reported that if a crafted executable is
placed in the root partition on a Windows file system, the
Firefox and Thunderbird installer will launch this program
after a standard installation instead of Firefox or
Thunderbird, running this program with the user's
privileges.
\*
MFSA 2012-68 / CVE-2012-3975: Security researcher
vsemozhetbyt reported that when the DOMParser is used to
parse text/html data in a Firefox extension, linked
resources within this HTML data will be loaded. If the data
being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could lead
to information leakage and can potentially be combined with
other attacks to become exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-69 / CVE-2012-3976: Security researcher
Mark Poticha reported an issue where incorrect SSL
certificate information can be displayed on the addressbar,
showing the SSL data for a previous site while another has
been loaded. This is caused by two onLocationChange events
being fired out of the expected order, leading to the
displayed certificate data to not be updated. This can be
used for phishing attacks by allowing the user to input
form or other data on a newer, attacking, site while the
credentials of an older site appear on the addressbar.
\*
MFSA 2012-70 / CVE-2012-3978: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that certain security
checks in the location object can be bypassed if chrome
code is called content in a specific manner. This allowed
for the loading of restricted content. This can be combined
with other issues to become potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-71 / CVE-2012-3979: Mozilla developer Blake
Kaplan reported that \_\_android\_log\_print is called
insecurely in places. If a malicious web page used a dump()
statement with a specially crafted string, it can trigger a
potentially exploitable crash.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-72 / CVE-2012-3980: Security researcher
Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can
execute injected code with chrome privileges, leading to
the running of malicious code in a privileged context. This
allows for arbitrary code execution through a malicious web
page if the web console is invoked by the user.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1
Build ID: 20120614114901
Steps to reproduce:
1. Put program named of the "program.exe" in "C:\".
2. Start installing through installer of Firefox. (Select standard install.)
3. Launch Firefox from "launched Firefox now".
4. But "program.exe" in "C:\" is run.
Actual results:
The program named of "program.exe" in ":C\" is run.
Expected results:
Firefox should be run.
FYI, also installer of Thunderbird has this problem.

This should have been fixed in Firefox 13: [bug 748764](/show_bug.cgi?id=748764 "VERIFIED FIXED - Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service") (see also <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2012/mfsa2012-35.html>)
There was a problem where people upgrading (as opposed to installing from scratch) didn't get the fixed version, but that should have been fixed in 13 as well ([bug 757711](/show_bug.cgi?id=757711 "VERIFIED FIXED - Service does not get replaced for newer builds since bug 748764"))
If you upgrade to the latest release version (should be 13.0.1 or 13.0.2) do you still see the same symptoms? If you uninstall Firefox completely and then reinstall does that fix the problem? Do you have multiple version of Firefox installed, some older than Firefox 13 that could be messing with the installed service?

Has anyone reproduced this?... the code to launch uses the full path.

Do the quotes in the nsis --Exec "something"-- line get sent to windows, or are those quotes only for purposes of delimiting a string in the nsis language? Without quotes full paths with spaces in the name are vulnerable to this kind of attack (see [bug 748764](/show_bug.cgi?id=748764 "VERIFIED FIXED - Possible Arbitrary Code Execution by Update Service")), although I haven't tried this case yet.
Worst case, on a shared windows machine someone else with access to put things in c:\ can possibly get you to run their thing with your privileges. Maybe one limited user trying to get a peek at the files from another limited user when that user installs Firefox into their own user space? A booby trap waiting for the machine Admin to install Firefox (or honestly, most other programs)?
Not a problem for most consumer machines that are single user or shared amongst a family of similarly-privileged users. A family with sneaky kids might be another story, but not a common case.Keywords: [sec-moderate](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-moderate&resolution=---)

> Has anyone reproduced this?
I can reproduce it using the following steps under Windows Vista SP2:
1. Download Firefox 13.0.1
2. Download Firefox 16.0a1 and copy it to "C:\", rename it to "program.exe"
3. Install Firefox 13.0.1 using the standard install
4. Launch Firefox 13.0.1 using "Launch Now" option in the installer
> Firefox 16.0a1 installer is initiated

Ya I'm pretty sure in NSIS you have to double quote your strings to get the desired result. For example in the maintenance service code we have this:
> nsExec::Exec '"$INSTDIR\$TempMaintServiceName" install'
Otherwise windows thinks that C:\Program is the path (if it exists) and the rest are the command line args.

C:\ has high integrity level like subfolders of program files though, so to create such an exe you need to be running as a high integrity process.

Looks good, I tested each case and it seems to be working for me.
I also checked for other cases in the NSIS files but couldn't find any others.

Approving for beta, will this land cleanly on the ESR? If so, please nominate or let us know if there can be an adjusted fix for that branch since this is something we know is being asked for by our ESR users.

Patch is slightly different, the only change is that it doesn't include the maintenanceservice related quoting. It doesn't exist on esr10.

Xerox Security Bulletin XRX13-003

FreeFlow Print Server v8
January 2013 Security Patch Cluster (includes Java 6 Update 37 Software)
v1.0
2/26/2013

Background

Oracle delivers quarterly Critical Patch Updates (CPU) to address US-CERT-announced Security vulnerabilities
and deliver reliability improvements to the Solaris Operating System.  Oracle no longer provides these patches
to the general public, but Xerox is authorized to deliver them to Customers with active FreeFlow Print Server
(FFPS) Support contracts (FSMA).  Customers who may have an Oracle Support Contract for their non-FFPS
Solaris  Servers  should  not  install  patches  that  have  not  been  customized  by  Xerox.  Otherwise  the  FFPS
software could be damaged and result in downtime and a lengthy re-installation service call.

This bulletin announces the availability of the following:

Note: Xerox recommends that customers evaluate their security needs periodically and if they need Security
patches  to  address  the  above  CVE  issues,  schedule  an  activity  with  their  Xerox  Service  team  to  install  this
announced Security Patch Cluster.

Applicability

These Security updates are intended for Xerox printer products running one of the FFPS 73.C0.41 or 73.B3.61
SPAR software releases.  This Security patch update has only been tested on these software releases and it is
recommended that they be installed on these FFPS software release versions.  They have not been tested with
the FFPS 73.B0.73 and 73.A3.31 software releases.

The  Xerox  CSE/Analyst  is  provided  a  tool  (accessible  from  CFO  Web  site)  that  enables  them  to  confirm  the
currently  installed  FFPS  software  release,  Security  Patch  Cluster,  and  Java  Software  version.    When  this
Security update has been installed on the FFPS system, this script will output the following:

FFPS Release Version:
FFPS Patch Cluster:
Java Version:

8.0_SP-3 (82.C5.24.86)
January 2013
Java 6 Update 37

Patch Install Methods

The  install  of  these  Security  patches  must  be  performed  by  the  Xerox  Customer  Service  Engineer  (CSE)  or
Analyst.  The customer process to obtain this Security update is to call the Xerox support number to request
the service.

Xerox strives to deliver these critical Security patch updates in a timely manner.  They are available from the
Xerox  Support  organization,  and  can  be  delivered  electronically  over  the  Internet  to  the  FFPS  system  via  a
GUI tool called the FFPS Update Manager. The other method of delivery is an FTP transfer to the FFPS system
or  writing  the  patch  cluster  to  DVD/USB  media.    A  more  detailed  description  of  the  methods  used  by  the
CSE/Analyst to install the Security patches is as follows:

FFPS Update Manager GUI

Once the Security patches are ready for customer delivery they are made available from the Xerox Edge
Host  and  Download  servers.    The  CSE/Analyst  uses  the  Update  Manager  GUI  on  the  FFPS  system  to
download  and  install  the  Security  patches  over  the  Internet.    When  the  Xerox  server  is  checked  for
updates  from  FFPS  Update  Manager,  this  Security  patch  update  is  listed  as  “January  2013  Security
Patch Cluster (FFPS v8)”.

This requires that the FFPS system be configured with the customer proxy information to gain Security
patch  update  access  from  the  Xerox  servers.    The  connection  is  initiated  by  the  FFPS  system  and  the
Xerox  servers  do  not  have  access  to  the  customer  network.    The  Xerox  server  and  FFPS  system  both
authenticate  each  other  before  a  data  transfer  can  be  successfully  established  between  the  two  end
points.

Hard Disk, DVD/USB Media

Once  the  Security  patch  updates  are  ready  for  customer  delivery  they  are  made  available  on  the  CFO
Web site.  The CSE/Analyst can download and prepare for the install by writing the Security patch update
into a well-known directory on the FFPS system, or on DVD/USB media.  The FFPS Security Patch Cluster is
delivered  as  an  ISO  image  and  ZIP  archive  file  to  provide  the  Xerox  Service  Representative  options  to
choose an install method.  Once the patch cluster has been prepared on media an install script can be run
to perform the install.  The install  script accepts an argument that identifies the media that contains a
copy of the FFPS Security Patch Cluster.  (E.g., # installSecPatches.sh [ disk | dvd | usb ]).

Important: The install of this Security patch update can fail if the archive file containing the patches is
corrupted from file transfer or writing to DVD media.  There have been reported install failures when the
archive  file  written  on  DVD  media  was  corrupt.    The  Security  patch  update  could  be  corrupted  when
writing  to  media  by  particular  DVD  burn  applications  writing  on  some  DVD  media  types.    It  is  very
important that the Security patch archive written onto the DVD install media be verified with the original
archive file that was written to DVD.

The Security patch cluster is delivered as a ZIP and an ISO file.  The file size and check sum of these files
on Windows and Solaris are as follows:

Security Patch File

Windows Size (Kb)

Solaris Size (bytes)

Solaris Checksum

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip

1,663,512

1,703,435,583

54151  3327023

Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.iso

1,615,862

1,703,794,688

13849  3327724

The Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip listed on the DVD media can be verified by comparing it to
the original archive file size and checksum.  Copy this archive to a location on the FFPS system and type
‘sum  Jan2013AndJava6U37Patches_v8.zip’  from  a  terminal  window.    The  checksum  value  should  be
‘54151    3327023’,  and  this  validates  the  correct  January  2013  Security  Patch  Cluster  is  written  on  the
DVD.

An update that fixes 32 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes three new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to 10.0.7ESR release, fixing a
lot of bugs and security problems.
The following security issues have been addressed:
\*
MFSA 2012-57: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-1971: Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse
Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew Sutherland, and
Jason Smith reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 14.
\*
CVE-2012-1970: Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse
Ruderman, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel
Holbert reported memory safety problems and crashes that
affect Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 14.
\*
MFSA 2012-58: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free issues using the Address Sanitizer
tool. Many of these issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution.
o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLEditor::CollapseAdjacentTextNodes CVE-2012-1972 o
Heap-use-after-free in nsObjectLoadingContent::LoadObject
CVE-2012-1973 o Heap-use-after-free in
gfxTextRun::CanBreakLineBefore CVE-2012-1974 o
Heap-use-after-free in PresShell::CompleteMove
CVE-2012-1975 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLSelectElement::SubmitNamesValues CVE-2012-1976 o
Heap-use-after-free in
MediaStreamGraphThreadRunnable::Run() CVE-2012-3956 o
Heap-buffer-overflow in nsBlockFrame::MarkLineDirty
CVE-2012-3957 o Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLEditRules::DeleteNonTableElements CVE-2012-3958 o
Heap-use-after-free in nsRangeUpdater::SelAdjDeleteNode
CVE-2012-3959 o Heap-use-after-free in
mozSpellChecker::SetCurrentDictionary CVE-2012-3960 o
Heap-use-after-free in RangeData::~RangeData CVE-2012-3961
o Bad iterator in text runs CVE-2012-3962 o use after free
in js::gc::MapAllocToTraceKind CVE-2012-3963 o
Heap-use-after-free READ 8 in gfxTextRun::GetUserData
CVE-2012-3964
\*
MFSA 2012-59 / CVE-2012-1956: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that it is possible to shadow the
location object using Object.defineProperty. This could be
used to confuse the current location to plugins, allowing
for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-60 / CVE-2012-3965: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that when a page opens a new tab,
a subsequent window can then be opened that can be
navigated to about:newtab, a chrome privileged page. Once
about:newtab is loaded, the special context can potentially
be used to escalate privilege, allowing for arbitrary code
execution on the local system in a maliciously crafted
attack.
\*
MFSA 2012-61 / CVE-2012-3966: Security researcher
Frederic Hoguin reported two related issues with the
decoding of bitmap (.BMP) format images embedded in icon
(.ICO) format files. When processing a negative "height"
header value for the bitmap image, a memory corruption can
be induced, allowing an attacker to write random memory and
cause a crash. This crash may be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-62: Security researcher miaubiz used the
Address Sanitizer tool to discover two WebGL issues. The
first issue is a use-after-free when WebGL shaders are
called after being destroyed. The second issue exposes a
problem with Mesa drivers on Linux, leading to a
potentially exploitable crash.
o
use after free, webgl fragment shader deleted
by accessor CVE-2012-3968
o
stack scribbling with 4-byte values choosable
among a few values, when using more than 16 sampler
uniforms, on Mesa, with all drivers CVE-2012-3967
\*
MFSA 2012-63: Security researcher Arthur Gerkis used
the Address Sanitizer tool to find two issues involving
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The first issue is a
buffer overflow in Gecko's SVG filter code when the sum of
two values is too large to be stored as a signed 32-bit
integer, causing the function to write past the end of an
array. The second issue is a use-after-free when an element
with a "requiredFeatures" attribute is moved between
documents. In that situation, the internal representation
of the "requiredFeatures" value could be freed prematurely.
Both issues are potentially exploitable.
o
Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsSVGFEMorphologyElement::Filter CVE-2012-3969
o
Heap-use-after-free in nsTArray\_base::Length()
CVE-2012-3970
\*
MFSA 2012-64 / CVE-2012-3971: Using the Address
Sanitizer tool, Mozilla security researcher Christoph Diehl
discovered two memory corruption issues involving the
Graphite 2 library used in Mozilla products. Both of these
issues can cause a potentially exploitable crash. These
problems were fixed in the Graphite 2 library, which has
been updated for Mozilla products.
\*
MFSA 2012-65 / CVE-2012-3972: Security research
Nicolas Gregoire used the Address Sanitizer tool to
discover an out-of-bounds read in the format-number feature
of XSLT, which can cause inaccurate formatting of numbers
and information leakage. This is not directly exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-66 / CVE-2012-3973: Mozilla security
researcher Mark Goodwin discovered an issue with the
Firefox developer tools' debugger. If remote debugging is
disabled, but the experimental HTTPMonitor extension has
been installed and enabled, a remote user can connect to
and use the remote debugging service through the port used
by HTTPMonitor. A remote-enabled flag has been added to
resolve this problem and close the port unless debugging is
explicitly enabled.
\*
MFSA 2012-67 / CVE-2012-3974: Security researcher
Masato Kinugawa reported that if a crafted executable is
placed in the root partition on a Windows file system, the
Firefox and Thunderbird installer will launch this program
after a standard installation instead of Firefox or
Thunderbird, running this program with the user's
privileges.
\*
MFSA 2012-68 / CVE-2012-3975: Security researcher
vsemozhetbyt reported that when the DOMParser is used to
parse text/html data in a Firefox extension, linked
resources within this HTML data will be loaded. If the data
being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could lead
to information leakage and can potentially be combined with
other attacks to become exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-69 / CVE-2012-3976: Security researcher
Mark Poticha reported an issue where incorrect SSL
certificate information can be displayed on the addressbar,
showing the SSL data for a previous site while another has
been loaded. This is caused by two onLocationChange events
being fired out of the expected order, leading to the
displayed certificate data to not be updated. This can be
used for phishing attacks by allowing the user to input
form or other data on a newer, attacking, site while the
credentials of an older site appear on the addressbar.
\*
MFSA 2012-70 / CVE-2012-3978: Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that certain security
checks in the location object can be bypassed if chrome
code is called content in a specific manner. This allowed
for the loading of restricted content. This can be combined
with other issues to become potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-71 / CVE-2012-3979: Mozilla developer Blake
Kaplan reported that \_\_android\_log\_print is called
insecurely in places. If a malicious web page used a dump()
statement with a specially crafted string, it can trigger a
potentially exploitable crash.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-72 / CVE-2012-3980: Security researcher
Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can
execute injected code with chrome privileges, leading to
the running of malicious code in a privileged context. This
allows for arbitrary code execution through a malicious web
page if the web console is invoked by the user.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-67

## Installer will launch incorrect executable following new installation

Announced
August 28, 2012
Reporter
Masato Kinugawa
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 15
* Firefox ESR 10.0.7
* SeaMonkey 2.13.2
* Thunderbird 16.0.2
* Thunderbird ESR 10.0.10

### Description

Security researcher **Masato Kinugawa** reported that if a
crafted executable is placed in the root partition on a Windows file system, the
Firefox and Thunderbird installer will launch this program after a standard
installation instead of Firefox or Thunderbird, running this program with the
user's privileges.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
