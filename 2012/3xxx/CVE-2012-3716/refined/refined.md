- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bounds checking issue existed in the handling of text glyphs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds memory reads or writes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Applications that use CoreText may be vulnerable to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Viewing or processing maliciously crafted text using CoreText.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft text that triggers the out-of-bounds read/write.
