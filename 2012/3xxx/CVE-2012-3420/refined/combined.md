| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=841298#c0)  Florian Weimer    2012-07-18 15:21:46 UTC  ``` This code path in DoFetch in src/pmcd/src/dofetch.c is problematic:      sts = __pmDecodeFetch(pb, &ctxnum, &when, &nPmids, &pmidList);     ...     /* Check that a profile has been received from the specified context */     if (ctxnum < 0 || ctxnum >= cip->szProfile || 	cip->profile[ctxnum] == NULL) { 	__pmNotifyErr(LOG_ERR, "DoFetch: no profile for ctxnum = %d\n", ctxnum); 	return PM_ERR_NOPROFILE;     }  __pmDecodeFetch pins the PDU buffer, but if the ctxnum is not valid, it is never unpinned.  This can be abused by unauthenticated pmcd clients to consume increasing amounts of memory, eventually crashing pmcd.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=841298#c2)  Mark Goodwin    2012-07-20 00:07:40 UTC  ```  Ken requested assignment, thanks Ken!   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=841298#c3)  Ken McDonell    2012-07-20 11:32:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 599366](attachment.cgi?id=599366&action=diff "proposed patch for dofetch.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=599366&action=edit "proposed patch for dofetch.c") proposed patch for dofetch.c  This one is done I believe.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=841298#c4)  Huzaifa S.

An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has two
fixes is now available. It includes two new package
versions.
Description:
pcp was updated to version 3.6.10 which fixes security
issues and also brings a lot of new features.
\*
Update to pcp-3.6.10.
o Transition daemons to run under an unprivileged
account. o Fixes for security advisory CVE-2012-5530:
tmpfile flaws; (bnc#782967). o Fix pcp(1) command
short-form pmlogger reporting. o Fix pmdalogger error
handling for directory files. o Fix pmstat handling of odd
corner case in CPU metrics. o Correct the python ctype used
for pmAtomValue 32bit ints. o Add missing RPM spec
dependency for python-ctypes. o Corrections to pmdamysql
metrics units. o Add pmdamysql slave status metrics. o
Improve pmcollectl error messages. o Parameterize
pmcollectl CPU counts in interrupt subsys. o Fix generic
RPM packaging for powerpc builds. o Fix python API use of
reentrant libpcp string routines. o Python code backporting
for RHEL5 in qa and pmcollectl. o Fix edge cases in
capturing interrupt error counts.
\*
Update to pcp-3.6.9.
o Python wrapper for the pmimport API o Make
sar2pcp work with the sysstat versions from RHEL5, RHEL6,
and all recent Fedora versions (which is almost all current
versions of sysstat verified). o Added a number of
additional metrics into the importer for people starting to
use it to analyse sar data from real customer incidents. o
Rework use of C99 "restrict" keyword in pmdalogger (Debian
bug: 689552) o Alot of work on the PCP QA suite, special
thanks to Tomas Dohnalek for all his efforts there. o Win32
build updates o Add "raw" disk active metrics so that
existing tools like iostat can be emulated o Allow sar2pcp
to accept XML input directly (.xml suffix), allowing it to
not have to run on the same platform as the sadc/sadf that
originally generated it. o Add PMI error codes into the
PCP::LogImport perl module. o Fix a typo in pmiUnits man
page synopsis section o Resolve pmdalinux ordering issue in
NUMA/CPU indom setup (Redhat bug: 858384) o Remove unused
pmcollectl imports (Redhat bug: 863210) o Allow event
traces to be used in libpcp interpolate mode
\*
Update to pcp-3.6.8.
o Corrects the disk/partition identification for
the MMC driver, which makes disk indom handling correct on
the Raspberry Pi (<http://www.raspberrypi.org/>) o Several
minor/basic fixes for pmdaoracle. o Improve pmcollectl
compatibility. o Make a few clarifications to pmcollectl.1.
o Improve python API test coverage. o Numerous updates to
the test suite in general. o Allow pmda Install scripts to
specify own dso name again. o Reconcile spec file
differences between PCP flavours. o Fix handling of
multiple contexts with a remote namespace. o Core socket
interface abstractions to support NSS (later). o Fix man
page SYNOPSIS section for pmUnpackEventRecords. o Add
--disable-shared build option for static builds.
\*
Update to pcp-3.6.6.
o Added the python PMAPI bindings and an initial
python client in pmcollectl. Separate, new package exists
for python libs for those platforms that split out packages
(rpm, deb). o Added a pcp-testsuite package for those
platforms that might want this (rpm, deb again, mainly) o
Re-introduced the pcp/qa subdirectory in pcp and deprecated
the external pcpqa git tree. o Fix potential buffer
overflow in pmlogger host name handling. o Reworked the
configure --prefix handling to be more like the rest of the
open source world. o Ensure the \_\_pmDecodeText ident
parameter is always set Resolves Red Hat bugzilla bug
#841306.

Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3418 CVE-2012-3419 CVE-2012-3420 CVE-2012-3421

It was discovered that Performance Co-Pilot (pcp), a framework for
performance monitoring, contains several vulnerabilites.

CVE-2012-3418
	Multiple buffer overflows in the PCP protocol decoders can
	cause PCP clients and servers to crash or, potentially,
	execute arbitrary code while processing crafted PDUs.

CVE-2012-3419
	The "linux" PMDA used by the pmcd daemon discloses sensitive
	information from the /proc file system to unauthenticated
	clients.

CVE-2012-3420
	Multiple memory leaks processing crafted requests can cause
	pmcd to consume large amounts of memory and eventually crash.

CVE-2012-3421
	Incorrect event-driven programming allows malicious clients to
	prevent other clients from accessing the pmcd daemon.

To address the information disclosure vulnerability, CVE-2012-3419, a
new "proc" PMDA was introduced, which is disabled by default.  If you
need access to this information, you need to enable the "proc" PMDA.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.3-squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.5.

We recommend that you upgrade your pcp packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=841706#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-07-19 22:49:09 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a denial of service flaw in pmcd (the PCP (Performance Co-Pilot) performance metrics collector daemon) due to incorrect event-driven programming.  Because the pduread() function in libpcp performs a select locally, waiting for more client data, an unauthenticated remote attacker could send individual bytes one by one, avoiding the timeout, and blocking pmcd in order to prevent it from responding to other legitimate requests.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=841706#c2)  Nathan Scott    2012-08-05 01:37:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 602308](attachment.cgi?id=602308&action=diff "Resolve an event-driven programming flaw in pmcd") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=602308&action=edit "Resolve an event-driven programming flaw in pmcd") Resolve an event-driven programming flaw in pmcd  This is Ken's patch to address this bug.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=841319#c0)  Florian Weimer    2012-07-18 16:41:03 UTC  ``` The return value of __pmGetPDU is both an error code and the value of the type field of the PDU.  A negative type value is treated as an error by HandleClientInput, and the PDU is never unpinned, even though it was pinned by __pmGetPDU because there was no error.  This leads to a memory leak and eventual pmcd crash.  I think one possible fix would be to reject negative type values in __pmGetPDU.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=841319#c2)  Mark Goodwin    2012-07-19 02:25:02 UTC  ``` [this is a test] Ken tried to comment on this BZ but got an error   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=841319#c3)  Ken McDonell    2012-07-19 04:35:43 UTC  ``` I'll work on this one.

QA 511 added to verify bug and fix.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=841319#c5)  Ken McDonell    2012-07-20 06:36:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 599314](attachment.cgi?id=599314&action=diff "proposed patch for pdu.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=599314&action=edit "proposed patch for pdu.c") proposed patch for pdu.c  This is Florian's fix.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
