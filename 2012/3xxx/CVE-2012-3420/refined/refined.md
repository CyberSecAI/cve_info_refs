Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2012-3420:

**CVE-2012-3420**

*   **Root Cause:** This CVE is caused by two distinct memory leaks in the `libpcp` library, specifically within the `pmcd` daemon (Performance Co-Pilot performance metrics collector daemon). These leaks occur during the processing of crafted requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Memory Leak in `DoFetch` Error Path:** A memory leak occurs in the `DoFetch` function when an invalid context number is provided. The PDU buffer, pinned by `__pmDecodeFetch`, is not unpinned in the error path, leading to a memory leak.
    *   **Memory Leak in `__pmGetPDU`:** A memory leak occurs due to in-band signaling in `__pmGetPDU`. When a negative type value is returned, the PDU isn't unpinned in the error handling, resulting in a leak.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger these memory leaks by sending crafted requests. This can lead to the `pmcd` daemon consuming excessive amounts of memory.
    *   **Crash:** The memory exhaustion can ultimately crash the `pmcd` daemon.
    *   **OOM Killer Trigger:** If the memory consumption is significant, it can trigger the operating system's Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer, which could terminate other processes on the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
    *   **Crafted Requests:** The attacker needs to send specially crafted requests that trigger the vulnerable code paths within `pmcd`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the system.
    *   The attacker needs network access to the `pmcd` daemon.

**Summary of related bugs:**

*   **Bug 841298:** This bug details the memory leak in `DoFetch` function, where the pinned buffer is not unpinned when an invalid `ctxnum` is provided.
*   **Bug 841319:** This bug describes the memory leak in `__pmGetPDU` due to in-band signaling when a negative type value is returned.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in `pcp` version 3.6.5.
*   The fixes were deployed in Fedora and EPEL through security updates.
*   The issue was also addressed in SUSE Linux Enterprise products.
*   The Debian security advisory DSA-2533-1 covers this vulnerability and several other related pcp vulnerabilities.
