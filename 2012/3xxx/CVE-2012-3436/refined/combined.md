Message-ID: <1343425359.4658.13.camel@lagune.teich>
Date: Fri, 27 Jul 2012 23:42:39 +0200
From: frosch <frosch@...nttd.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request for OpenTTD

Hello,

we, the OpenTTD developers, have identified a security vulnerability in
OpenTTD (an open source game with multiplayer). Would you be so kind as
to allocate a CVE id for this issue?

The issue concerns a denial of service vulnerabilty which enables
an attacker to force the server into an invalid game state. The
server will abort upon detecting this state.
This attack can be performed using an unmodified client via normal
game interaction. The attack requires authorization, but most servers
do not implement authorization. The first vulnerable version is 0.6.0,
the upcoming 1.2.2 release will have the issue fixed.

Once a CVE id is allocated, the issue and fix will be documented at
<http://security.openttd.org/CVE-2012-xxxx>

Thanks in advance,
Christoph 'frosch' Elsenhans

Denial of service using ships on half tiles and landscaping.

Simple steps to reproduce the issue, and show the severity:

1. start a new game. For this reproduction you do not need to start a server;
   you can see the crash locally, but due to the nature of OpenTTD the crash
   will also happen on the server you’re playing on with multiplayer.
2. build some horizontal or vertical track at the coast, so that half of the
   tile remains water or coast. The tile should either have
   one corner raised with flat water on one half tile (case 1)
   or two adjacent corners raised with coast on the sloped half tile (case 2)
3. build a ship depot, a ship and a dock at the coast, and start the ship
4. obstruct the path of the ship in a way so that it enters the tile with half
   railtrack and half water
5. landscape the tile by raising the water corner while the ship is on it
   (only needed in case 1)
6. both cases will make the ship end up on land
7. remove the track using the “remove track” tool while the ship is on the tile
8. server segfaults due to NULL pointer dereference.

The problem is caused by incorrectly handling the water/coast aspect of tiles
which also have railtracks on one half.
The fix adds the correct checks to the landscaping and movement code.

If you try to reproduce this with the patch applied you’ll see that,
in case 1, step 5 will deny the terraforming and in case 2 the ship simply
won’t try to enter the coast tile.

This bug was triggered incidentally by a user playing online when landscaping
near a ship. We have not seen any signs of this bug being exploited forcefully.

Perfect, thanks. Please use CVE-2012-3436 for this issue.

P.S. with respect to "In some cases ships could be covered with land."
couldn't the ship sail into a cave or over hanging cliff? ;)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
