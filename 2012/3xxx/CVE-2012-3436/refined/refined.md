The issue is caused by incorrectly handling the water/coast aspect of tiles which also have railtracks on one half. The fix adds the correct checks to the landscaping and movement code.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1.  Build track at the coast so that half the tile is water or coast.\n2.  Build a ship depot, a ship, and a dock.\n3.  Start the ship and obstruct its path so it enters the tile with half railtrack and half water.\n4.  Landscape the tile by raising the water corner while the ship is on it (needed in one of the cases). This causes the ship to end up on land.\n5.  Remove the track using the remove track tool.\n6.  The server will segfault due to a NULL pointer dereference."
