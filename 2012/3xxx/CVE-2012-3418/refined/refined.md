  "CVE-2012-3418": {
    "Description": "Multiple integer and heap-based buffer overflow flaws in PCP (Performance Co-Pilot) libpcp protocol decoding functions. These flaws could lead to daemon crashes or the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges. Many of these flaws can be exploited without requiring the attacker to be authenticated.",
    "Root cause": "Multiple integer and heap-based buffer overflow flaws in libpcp protocol decoding functions",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Daemon crashes or the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted network packets",
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to send network packets to the vulnerable service"
  },
  "CVE-2012-3419": {
    "Description": "The \"linux\" PMDA used by the pmcd daemon discloses sensitive information from the /proc file system to unauthenticated clients.",
    "Root cause": "The `linux` PMDA exports part of the `/proc` filesystem, including privileged information.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Privileged information disclosure"
     ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of system information (including ASLR bypass data and command-line arguments of running processes)",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access to the pmcd service",
    "Required capabilities": "Unauthenticated network access to the pmcd service"
  },
   "CVE-2012-3420": {
    "Description": "Multiple memory leaks processing crafted requests can cause pmcd to consume large amounts of memory and eventually crash.",
     "Root cause": "Memory leaks due to crafted requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "pmcd crash due to excessive memory consumption or OOM killer triggering",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted network packets",
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to send network packets to the vulnerable service"
  },
  "CVE-2012-3421": {
        "Description": "Incorrect event-driven programming allows malicious clients to prevent other clients from accessing the pmcd daemon.",
        "Root cause": "Incorrect event-driven programming in `pduread()` function of `libpcp`.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Denial of service vulnerability due to flawed event-driven programming"
        ],
        "Impact": "Denial of service, preventing legitimate clients from accessing pmcd",
          "Attack vectors":"Sending individual bytes one by one to exhaust pmcd's resources.",
         "Required capabilities":"Unauthenticated network access to the pmcd service"
