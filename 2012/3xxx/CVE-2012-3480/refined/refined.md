```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflows in the `strtod`, `strtof`, and `strtold` functions within the GNU C library (glibc). These overflows occur due to using 'int' for calculations involving string lengths, leading to stack-based buffer overflows.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Integer overflows leading to stack-based buffer overflows.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Application crash (denial of service)
  - Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
- Attack vectors:
  - Local attacker providing crafted input to an application that uses the affected `strto*` functions.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Ability to control or influence the input string given to applications that use `strtod`, `strtof`, `strtold` functions, or related functions like `atof` or `scanf`.
  - Local access to the system.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability can be triggered with an input string size slightly under a fifth of a GB.
- The issues are caused by using 'int' to store variables like digit count, integer part count, leading zeros, and exponents, which can exceed 'int' limits.
- The vulnerability was discovered while working on a fix for another bug (strtod rounding).
- The fix includes using `size_t` and `intmax_t` for relevant variables, with added assertions to prevent overflows.
- The mailing list thread includes an example exploit to test the vulnerability.
