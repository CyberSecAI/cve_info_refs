# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=851252#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-23 15:13:36 UTC  ``` A flaw has been found in the way qemu handles VT100 escape sequences when emulating certain devices with a virtual console backend.  An attacker who has sufficient privilege to access a vulnerable device within a guest can overwrite portions qemu address space. This can allow them to escalate their privileges to that of the qemu process on the host.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=851252#c1)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-23 15:15:48 UTC  ``` Xen ===  All hosts running HVM guests are potentially vulnerable to this depending on the specific guest configuration. The default configuration is not vulnerable.  When using libvirt, the default configuration of managed guests is safe, too. Libvirt by default configures the serial and parallel ports in a way that is not vulnerable.  Please note that configuring serial and/or parallel port to use vc backend later, makes the host vulnerable even when libvirt is used to manage the guest.  PV guests are not affected by this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=851252#c2)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-23 15:17:04 UTC  ``` KVM ===  All hosts running KVM guests are potentially vulnerable to this depending on the specific guest configuration. The default configuration is not vulnerable.  The only supported way of running qemu-kvm on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is using libvirt. When guest is created, libvirt by default configures the serial and parallel ports in a way that is not vulnerable.  Please note that configuring serial and/or parallel port to use vc backend later, makes the host vulnerable even when libvirt is used to manage the guest.  Running qemu-kvm directly from command line can potentially make the system vulnerable.   On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, command line execution of qemu-kvm is supported provided that "-nodefaults" parameter is passed in as one of the arguments. Using "-nodefaults" disables default insecure configuration. For further information please refer to [1]. As long as "-nodefaults" argument is passed in and serial and/or parallel port is not configured to use vc backend, the host is not vulnerable.    [1] <https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Virtualization_Administration_Guide/ch19s10.html>  When guest is created, libvirt by default configures the serial and parallel ports in a way that is not vulnerable.  Please note that configuring serial and/or parallel port to use vc backend later, makes the host vulnerable even when libvirt is used to manage the guest.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=851252#c6)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-23 15:22:17 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did affect the versions of xen package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Subject: CVE Request -- glibc: Integer overflows, leading to stack-based
 buffer overflows in strto* related routines

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  multiple integer overflows, leading to stack-based buffer overflows were found in various stdlib functions of GNU libc (strtod, strtof, strtold, strtod_l and related routines). If an application, using the affected stdlib functions, did not perform user-level sanitization of provided inputs, a local attacker could use this flaw to cause such an application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Upstream bug report:
[1] <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14459>

Upstream patch (might not be the final one):
[2] <http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2012-08/msg00202.html>

References:
[3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=847715>

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Fix strtod integer/buffer overflow (bug 14459)

* *From*: "Joseph S. Myers" <joseph at codesourcery dot com>
* *To*: <libc-alpha at sourceware dot org>

* *Subject*: Fix strtod integer/buffer overflow (bug 14459)

---

```
Bug 14459, which I found while working on the fix for bug 3479 (strtod
rounding), is integer overflows in strtod (and strtof, strtold,
strtod_l, etc.) on certain input, which can also result in buffer
overflows on the stack.

The essential problem is the use of int for various variables and
internal calculations that may exceed the range of int.  Various such
cases appear if the string passed is over 2GB in size, but the way
exponent limits are calculated mean that minimum input size to trigger
the problems is slightly under a fifth of a GB.

Three variables, dig_no, int_no and lead_zero, count the number of
various elements in the input in memory, and so size_t is the
appropriate type to use for them; this patch does so (with various
associated casts to avoid this introducing signed/unsigned mixed
operations; even if those are safe in a particular case, they are
often confusing, so it seems best to avoid them).  Exponents can be
larger (given an N-digit integer before the exponent, an exponent of
-4N can be appropriate for a hex float).  This patch uses intmax_t to
represent exponents, with plenty of assertions added (the code already
had quite a few) to verify that the values in question will not
overflow those variables or intermediate calculations.  It should not
be possible to trigger these assertions without input around 2^61
bytes or more in size, which I don't think is plausible on present-day
systems; if input of that size becomes relevant in future, on systems
where intmax_t is still 64-bit, it will be necessary to use a more
complicated approach to handle exponents (logically, they are
something like "signed size_t plus a few bits").

The testcase is the example I found that uses the smallest input;
there are plenty of other ways in which the integer overflows could
cause wrong results, if not buffer overflow, for larger input that
seems less reasonable to add to the testsuite.

I don't know how exploitable this buffer overflow is (given a program
passing untrusted input of (nearly) a fifth of a GB or more to
strtod-family functions or callers such as atof and scanf) - at least
the example testcase I add and give in the bug results (for me) in a
segfault from within str_to_mpn, and never gets as far as strtod_l
trying to return to its caller (which would be the point at which an
overwritten return address would be used).  But it seems plausible
that for some programs there would be some way to exploit some
overflow possibility fixed by this patch.

gnulib does not use glibc's strtod (it has a more minimal strtod
wrapper that fixes selected bugs from various systems' strtod,
including a limited subset of the various bugs in glibc that have been
fixed over the years) so there should be no issue of the buggy code
being embedded directly into various packages.

Tested x86 and x86_64.

# RHSA-2012:1207 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: glibc security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1207)

## Topic

Updated glibc packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C and standard math libraries used
by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux
system cannot function properly.

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to stack-based buffer overflows,
were found in glibc's functions for converting a string to a numeric
representation (strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()). If an application used
such a function on attacker controlled input, it could cause the
application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-3480)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, logic errors in various mathematical functions, including

exp, exp2, expf, exp2f, pow, sin, tan, and rint, caused inconsistent
results when the functions were used with the non-default rounding mode.
This could also cause applications to crash in some cases. With this
update, the functions now give correct results across the four different
rounding modes. (BZ#839411)

All users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

# USN-1589-1: GNU C Library vulnerabilities

2 October 2012

Multiple security issues were fixed in the GNU C Library.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [eglibc](/security/cves?package=eglibc) - GNU C Library
* [glibc](/security/cves?package=glibc) - GNU C Library

## Details

It was discovered that positional arguments to the printf() family

of functions were not handled properly in the GNU C Library. An

attacker could possibly use this to cause a stack-based buffer

overflow, creating a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2012-3404](/security/CVE-2012-3404), [CVE-2012-3405](/security/CVE-2012-3405), [CVE-2012-3406](/security/CVE-2012-3406))

It was discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in the

strtod(), strtof() and strtold() functions in the GNU C Library. An

attacker could possibly use this to trigger a stack-based buffer

overflow, creating a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2012-3480](/security/CVE-2012-3480))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor6 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1325)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes multiple security issues and
one bug is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences
when emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to
write to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual
console back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the
host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)

This flaw did not affect the default use of Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor: it is not possible to add a device that uses a
virtual console back-end via Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.

To specify a virtual console back-end for a device and therefore be
vulnerable to this issue, the device would have to be created another way,
for example, by using a VDSM hook. Note that at this time hooks can only be
used on Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts, not Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor.

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to stack-based buffer overflows,
were found in glibc's functions for converting a string to a numeric
representation (strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()). If an application used
such a function on attacker controlled input, it could cause the
application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-3480)

Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting the CVE-2012-3515
issue.

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
various security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes
included in this update address the following CVE numbers:

CVE-2012-4244 (bind issue)

CVE-2012-3524 (dbus issue)

CVE-2012-2313, CVE-2012-2384, CVE-2012-2390, CVE-2012-3430, and
CVE-2012-3552 (kernel issues)

CVE-2012-3445 (libvirt issue)

CVE-2011-3102 and CVE-2012-2807 (libxml2 issues)

CVE-2011-1202, CVE-2011-3970, CVE-2012-2825, CVE-2012-2870, CVE-2012-2871,
and CVE-2012-2893 (libxslt issues)

This updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor package also
fixes the following bug:

* Previously, the Manager listed all installed Hypervisor ISO images as

available even when they did not support the VDSM compatibility version
required by the selected host. The rhev-hypervisor6 package now maintains a
text file for each installed ISO image. The file lists the VDSM
compatibility versions supported by the relevant ISO image. The Manager
uses this information to ensure that only those Hypervisor ISO images that
are relevant to the selected host are listed. (BZ#856827)

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=847715#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-13 10:46:46 UTC  ``` Multiple integer overflows, leading to stack-based buffer overflows were found in various stdlib functions of GNU libc (strtod, strtof, strtold, strtod_l and related routines).

## Synopsis

Moderate: glibc security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1208)

## Topic

Updated glibc packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The glibc packages provide the standard C and standard math libraries used
by multiple programs on the system. Without these libraries, the Linux
system cannot function properly.

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to stack-based buffer overflows,
were found in glibc's functions for converting a string to a numeric
representation (strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()). If an application used
such a function on attacker controlled input, it could cause the
application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-3480)

All users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

RHSA-2012:1262 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2012-09-13
Updated:
2012-09-13
# RHSA-2012:1262 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor5 security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor5 package that fixes multiple security issues and
various bugs is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor5 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.
It includes everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A
subset of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red
Hat Enterprise Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences
when emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to
write to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual
console back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the
host or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to stack-based buffer overflows,
were found in glibc's functions for converting a string to a numeric
representation (strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()). If an application used
such a function on attacker controlled input, it could cause the
application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2012-3480)

Red Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting the CVE-2012-3515
issue.

This updated package provides updated components that include various bug
fixes, as well as a fix for CVE-2012-3515 in the xen package; however, for
this component, it had no security impact on Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Hypervisor itself.

Users of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14459#c0)  Joseph Myers    2012-08-12 18:23:06 UTC  ``` strtod and related functions have integer overflow bugs resulting from the use of "int" for internal variables and calculations where the actual values involved may exceed the range of int.  These integer overflows can in turn result in buffer overflow on the stack.  The following testcase illustrates such a buffer overflow.  Testing a patch.  (I found this issue while working on the fix for [bug 3479](show_bug.cgi?id=3479 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect rounding in strtod()").)  #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h>  #define EXPONENT "e-2147483649" #define SIZE 214748364  int main (void) {   char *p = malloc (1 + SIZE + sizeof (EXPONENT));   if (p == NULL)     {       perror ("malloc");       exit (EXIT_FAILURE);     }   p[0] = '1';   memset (p + 1, '0', SIZE);   memcpy (p + 1 + SIZE, EXPONENT, sizeof (EXPONENT));   double d = strtod (p, NULL);   printf ("%a\n", d);   exit (EXIT_SUCCESS); } ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=14459#c1)  Rich Felker    2012-08-13 19:11:52 UTC  ``` In general, test cases for giant-string bugs like this can be written so as not to require a machine with insane amounts of free memory by using mmap cleverly:  1. Make a giant PROT_NONE anonymous mapping of the entire size. 2. Allocate a shared memory object of some reasonable size, e.g. 256k and fill it with the pattern you want (e.g. all '0'). 3. Repeatedly map the object over the original mapping at each offset with MAP_FIXED|MAP_SHARED. 4. Make new anonymous mappings over top of the parts you want to modify (usually the head and tail) using MAP_FIXED and fill them with the necessary data.  This kind of design can take a test case that would otherwise bog most systems down swapping for several minutes and make it run in a matter of seconds. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14459#c2)  Joseph Myers    2012-08-27 16:12:05 UTC  ``` Fixed for 2.17 by:  commit d6e70f4368533224e66d10b7f2126b899a3fd5e4 Author: Joseph Myers <joseph@codesourcery.com> Date:   Mon Aug 27 15:59:24 2012 +0000      Fix strtod integer/buffer overflow ([bug 14459](show_bug.cgi?id=14459 "RESOLVED FIXED - strtod integer and buffer overflows (CVE-2012-3480)")).
