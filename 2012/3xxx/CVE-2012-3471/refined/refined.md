Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2012-3471:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `incident_id` parameter before using it in a SQL query within the `admin/reports` and `members/reports` controllers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Because the `incident_id` is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization, an attacker can manipulate the input to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain control of the database server, depending on the database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the `admin/reports/edit` and `members/reports/edit` endpoints, specifically when crafting malicious values for the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. Access to the affected endpoints is required, meaning any unauthenticated user can exploit the members/reports endpoint, and likely any logged-in admin can exploit the admin/reports endpoint.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippets are located in the `application/controllers/admin/reports.php` and `application/controllers/members/reports.php` files.
- The fix involves changing the direct concatenation of the `incident_id` into the SQL query to using a prepared statement with a placeholder (`?`) and passing the `incident_id` as a parameter to the query.
-   **Vulnerable code:**
```php
$sql = "SELECT AsText(geometry) as geometry, geometry\_label,
geometry\_comment, geometry\_color, geometry\_strokewidth
FROM ".Kohana::config('database.default.table\_prefix')."geometry
WHERE incident\_id=".$id;
$query = $db->query($sql);
```
-   **Fixed code:**
```php
$sql = "SELECT AsText(geometry) as geometry, geometry\_label,
geometry\_comment, geometry\_color, geometry\_strokewidth
FROM ".Kohana::config('database.default.table\_prefix')."geometry
WHERE incident_id = ?";
$query = $db->query($sql, $id);
```
