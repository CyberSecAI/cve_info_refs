- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue existed in Mail's handling of attachments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: If a subsequent mail attachment used the same Content-ID as a previous one, the previous attachment would be displayed, even in the case where the 2 mails originated from different senders.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This could facilitate some spoofing or phishing attacks, potentially leading users to interact with content they believe is from a different source.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious email containing an attachment with the same Content-ID as a previous attachment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the target user.
