# WordPress 3.5.2 Maintenance and Security Release

---

WordPress 3.5.2 is now available. This is the second maintenance release of 3.5, fixing [12 bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=3.5.2). **This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.** The WordPress security team resolved seven security issues, and this release also contains some additional security hardening.

The security fixes included:

* Blocking server-side request forgery attacks, which could potentially enable an attacker to gain access to a site.
* Disallow contributors from improperly publishing posts, reported by [Konstantin Kovshenin](http://kovshenin.com/), or reassigning the post’s authorship, reported by [Luke Bryan](http://www.sharefaith.com/).
* An update to the SWFUpload external library to fix cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Reported by [mala](http://ma.la) and [Szymon Gruszecki](http://mars.iti.pk.edu.pl/~grucha/). (Developers: More on SWFUpload [here](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/06/21/secure-swfupload/).)
* Prevention of a denial of service attack, affecting sites using password-protected posts.
* An update to an external TinyMCE library to fix a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Reported by [Wan Ikram](http://twitter.com/rinakikun).
* Multiple fixes for cross-site scripting. Reported by [Andrea Santese](http://webapplicationsecurity.altervista.org/) and Rodrigo.
* Avoid disclosing a full file path when a upload fails. Reported by [Jakub Galczyk](http://hauntit.blogspot.de/).

We appreciated [responsible disclosure](https://codex.wordpress.org/FAQ_Security) of these issues directly to our security team. For more information on the changes, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5.2) or consult [the list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.5?rev=24498&stop_rev=23347).

[Download WordPress 3.5.2](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.5.2.zip) or update now from the Dashboard → Updates menu in your site’s admin area.

*Also:* **WordPress 3.6 Beta 4:** If you are testing WordPress 3.6, please note that [WordPress 3.6 Beta 4](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.6-beta4.zip) (zip) includes fixes for these security issues.

# Announcing a secure SWFUpload fork

The WordPress security team has officially forked the [long-abandoned SWFUpload project](https://code.google.com/p/swfupload/) and is strongly encouraging all web developers who use SWFUpload to update.

**We strongly suggest you do not use SWFUpload. But if you must, use this fork.** You can find it on GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the ‘pull request’ where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner. <https://github.com/> at [github.com/wordpress/secure-swfupload](http://github.com/wordpress/secure-swfupload).

WordPress does *not* use SWFUpload, but we continue to include it in WordPress coreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. for plugins that have yet to be updated to use [Plupload](http://plupload.com/), our upload library of choice. Plupload is written and actively maintained by [Moxiecode](http://www.moxiecode.com/), the developers of [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com/).

We do not condone the use of abandonware. We only wish to make the web a better place by ensuring that developers have access to a secure version of SWFUpload, when the only alternative may be to use insecure code.

This is a fork of SWFUpload 2.2.0.1 and includes cross-site scripting fixes that have been reported by Szymon Gruszecki (CVE-2013-2205 and CVE-2012-2399), and Neal Poole and Nathan Partlan (CVE-2012-3414). It also includes fixes from Yelp’s engineering team for CVE-2012-2399.

**WordPress 3.5.2**, [released moments ago](https://wordpress.org/news/2013/06/wordpress-3-5-2/), includes fixes for CVE-2013-2205 and CVE-2012-2399. WordPress 3.3.2 (2012-04-20) included a fix for CVE-2012-3414 and an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-2399.

**If you think you have found a vulnerability in this fork of SWFUpload, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us responsibly.** Please email reports of security vulnerabilities to swfupload-security AT wordpress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization. <https://wordpress.org/>. These reports will be reviewed by the WordPress security team and by security researchers contributing to this project, including Neal and Szymon.

### Summary

[Nathan Partlan](http://greywhind.wordpress.com/) and I discovered and reported vulnerabilities in two
common Flash applets, [SWFUpload](http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/) and [Plupload](http://www.plupload.com/). SWFUpload’s
developers have not released a fix for the XSS issue identified.
Plupload’s developers have released [v1.5.4](http://www.plupload.com/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=1685) to address the identified
CSRF issue.

Both of these applets are present in Wordpress installations. These
vulnerabilities were addressed as part of [Wordpress 3.3.2](http://wordpress.org/news/2012/04/wordpress-3-3-2/).

### Vulnerability #1: XSS in SWFUpload (CVE-2012-3414)

The latest version of SWFUpload ([ActionScript code available here](http://code.google.com/p/swfupload/source/browse/swfupload/trunk/core/Flash/SWFUpload.as?spec=svn916&r=852))
contains the following code:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ``` | ``` // Get the movie name this.movieName = root.loaderInfo.parameters.movieName;  // **Configure the callbacks** // The JavaScript tracks all the instances of SWFUpload on a page.  We can access the instance // associated with this SWF file using the movieName.  Each callback is accessible by making // a call directly to it on our instance.  There is no error handling for undefined callback functions. // A developer would have to deliberately remove the default functions,set the variable to null, or remove // it from the init function. this.flashReady_Callback         = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].flashReady"; this.fileDialogStart_Callback    = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].fileDialogStart"; this.fileQueued_Callback         = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].fileQueued"; this.fileQueueError_Callback     = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].fileQueueError"; this.fileDialogComplete_Callback = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].fileDialogComplete";  this.uploadStart_Callback        = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadStart"; this.uploadProgress_Callback     = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadProgress"; this.uploadError_Callback        = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadError"; this.uploadSuccess_Callback      = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadSuccess";  this.uploadComplete_Callback     = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].uploadComplete";  this.debug_Callback              = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].debug";  this.testExternalInterface_Callback = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].testExternalInterface"; this.cleanUp_Callback            = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].cleanUp"; this.buttonAction_Callback       = "SWFUpload.instances[\"" + this.movieName + "\"].buttonAction";  ``` |
| --- | --- |

Each of those callbacks is used as the first parameter to
[ExternalInterface.call](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/external/ExternalInterface.html), which executes JavaScript in the context of
the current page. Since movieName is derived from user input (a Flash
parameter) and a Flash applet can be loaded directly (with parameters in
the URL), the Flash applet allows for reflected cross-site scripting.
For sites where the applet is hosted on the same domain as the main
website, this is a serious security concern.

At this point, I’m not aware of a patched version of the applet source
(let me know in the comments if there is one!). My suggestion would be
to filter the movieName parameter so that only alpha-numeric characters
are allowed.

Proof of Concept:
[http://demo.swfupload.org/v220/swfupload/swfupload.swf?movieName=%22%5d%29;}catch%28e%29{}if%28!self.a%29self.a=!alert%281%29;//](http://demo.swfupload.org/v220/swfupload/swfupload.swf?movieName=%22]%29;}catch%28e%29{}if%28!self.a%29self.a=!alert%281%29;//)

### Vulnerability #2: CSRF in Plupload (CVE-2012-3415)

The Plupload applet called `Security.allowDomain('*')` to allow the
applet to be used from any domain (so it could be served from S3, for
instance). That meant people could interact with the Plupload applet
from any other site on the Internet by embedding it on a page and using
JavaScript. But due to the way the same-origin policy works in Flash,
the applet could still make requests back to the domain on which it was
hosted. In addition, people can specify the full URL for an upload
request via JavaScript and the result of that request (ie: the HTML of
the resulting page) is passed back via JavaScript to the embedding page.

So, if an attacker could convince a target to interact with the applet
(by selecting a single file to be uploaded), the attacker could make a
request to the domain that the applet was hosted on and read back the
full response. That could disclose CSRF tokens or other sensitive
information. This issue was especially important for Wordpress
installations, where Plupload applets are hosted inside of the
wp-includes directory by default.

The issue was resolved by removing the call to
`Security.allowDomain('*')` by default.

### Conclusion

Third-party Flash applets are vulnerable to many of the same sorts of
attacks as other parts of web applications. However, they are often
included in sites without a proper understanding of the security risks.

***Update (08/01/2012):*** I’ve updated the post to include the CVE
identifiers assigned to these vulnerabilities.
