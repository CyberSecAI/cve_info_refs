Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-3414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way SWFUpload handles the `movieName` parameter in its Flash applet. This parameter, derived from user input, is used to construct JavaScript callback function names using string concatenation, which are then executed using `ExternalInterface.call`. Since the `movieName` parameter isn't properly sanitized, it can be manipulated to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. By crafting a malicious `movieName` parameter, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Stealing session cookies, leading to account compromise.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the page, potentially for phishing attacks.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that includes a specially crafted `movieName` parameter. This URL can be sent to the victim via email, social media, or other means. When the victim loads the SWF file with this crafted URL, the injected JavaScript code executes within their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious `movieName` parameter to be passed to the SWFUpload applet.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim must load the crafted URL, typically by clicking a link or being redirected. This can be accomplished through social engineering.
*   **No specific authentication is required.** The vulnerability is client side.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in SWFUpload before a patch was developed by the WordPress security team, which forked SWFUpload.
*   The vulnerable SWFUpload versions were used by some WordPress plugins before being updated to Plupload
*   WordPress 3.3.2 included a fix for CVE-2012-3414. WordPress 3.5.2 also contained this fix, as well as fixes for other SWFUpload related vulnerabilities
*   The fix was implemented by filtering the `movieName` parameter to only allow alphanumeric characters.
*   A proof of concept URL is provided: `http://demo.swfupload.org/v220/swfupload/swfupload.swf?movieName=%22%5d%29;}catch%28e%29{}if%28!self.a%29self.a=!alert%281%29;//`
