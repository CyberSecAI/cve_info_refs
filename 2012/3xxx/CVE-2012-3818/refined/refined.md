The blog post describes several security vulnerabilities in the Revelation password manager. While the CVE description is a placeholder, the provided text details multiple specific issues that could be the basis of a CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   **Weak key derivation:** Revelation uses a weak key derivation function (KDF), which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. It uses a simple hash of the password with 200 bits of zeros appended instead of a proper KDF, drastically reducing the effective entropy of the encryption key.
*   **Plaintext export:** The fpm exporter in Revelation does not encrypt passwords, leaving them in plaintext even though it asks for a password during export/import.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient key derivation:** The password is not properly hashed with a salt using a strong KDF such as PBKDF2. Instead, the password is concatenated with 200 bits of zeros before hashing.
*   **Lack of salt:** The blog mentions that the salt used in Revelation is not long or varied enough. Also, the proposed PBKDF2 implementation did not include the salt in the hash function. This makes rainbow table attacks feasible.
*   **Plaintext export:** Passwords are not encrypted at all in the fpm exporter.
*   **Unencrypted data:** Even if passwords are encrypted, a lack of full file encryption leaves sensitive information about what the passwords are used for.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Password cracking:** Weak KDF allows attackers to crack passwords in a reasonable timeframe using brute-force attacks, even with a normal desktop computer. An 8-character alphanumeric password could be cracked in about 7 weeks. Custom hardware solutions would be much faster.
*   **Data exposure:** Plaintext export can lead to direct exposure of passwords if the exported file is compromised.
*   **Full database compromise:** Lack of proper key derivation and weak salting could lead to mass password database compromise via rainbow table attacks and other cracking methods.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Offline brute-force attacks:** An attacker could obtain a copy of a Revelation password database file and then use brute-force attacks to try to crack the master password.
*   **Compromised export files:** If an attacker gets access to a password export file they can read the passwords as plain text without any decryption.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to the password database file:** An attacker needs access to the encrypted database file to perform the brute-force attack, or a compromised exported file in plain text.
*   **Technical skills:** The attacker needs knowledge of password cracking techniques and access to computing resources for password cracking.
