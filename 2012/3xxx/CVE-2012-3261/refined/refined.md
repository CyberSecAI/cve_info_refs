The vulnerability lies within the HP SiteScope SOAP features. Specifically, it stems from issues in the way the SOAP API is handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is within the SiteScope SOAP API which allows for both remote information disclosure and remote code execution. The bulletin indicates that there are multiple vulnerabilities within the SOAP interface, and this is one of them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
*   Remote disclosure of sensitive information.
*   Remote code execution on the affected system.
These impacts are categorized with a CVSS base score of 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C).

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote (AV:N), meaning an attacker can exploit this over a network. The attack complexity is low (AC:L), indicating that the vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit. No authentication is required (Au:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be in a network position to send network requests to the vulnerable HP SiteScope server, and requires no authentication to execute attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in HP SiteScope v11.10 for Windows, Linux, and Solaris.
*   HP has provided an update (v11.13) to address the vulnerability.
*   After applying the update, the vulnerable SOAP API needs to be disabled by setting the `"_disableOldAPIs=true"` property in the `master.config` file. By default this is disabled.
