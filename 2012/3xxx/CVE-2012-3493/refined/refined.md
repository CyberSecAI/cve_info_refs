{
  "CVE-2012-3493": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that Condor exposed private information in the data in the ClassAds format served by condor_startd. An unauthenticated user able to connect to condor_startd's port could request a ClassAd for a running job, provided they could guess or brute-force the PID of the job. This could expose the ClaimId which, if obtained, could be used to control the job as well as start new jobs on the system.",
    "Root cause": "The GIVE_REQUEST_AD handler in Condor exposed the private ClaimId information.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure",
      "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized control of running jobs and start new jobs on the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access to condor_startd's port.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to connect to the condor_startd's port and guess or brute-force the PID of a running job."
