## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1281)

## Topic

Updated Grid component packages that fix several security issues, add
various enhancements and fix multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

A number of unprotected resources (web pages, export functionality, image
viewing) were found in Cumin. An unauthenticated user could bypass intended
access restrictions, resulting in information disclosure. (CVE-2012-2680)

Cumin could generate weak session keys, potentially allowing remote
attackers to predict session keys and obtain unauthorized access to Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2681)

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws in Cumin could allow remote attackers
to inject arbitrary web script on a web page displayed by Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2683)

An SQL injection flaw in Cumin could allow remote attackers to manipulate
the contents of the back-end database via a specially-crafted URL.
(CVE-2012-2684)

When Cumin handled image requests, clients could request images of
arbitrary sizes. This could result in large memory allocations on the Cumin
server, leading to an out-of-memory condition. (CVE-2012-2685)

Cumin did not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. If an
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the Cumin web interface,
into visiting a specially-crafted web page, it could lead to unauthorized
command execution in the Cumin web interface with the privileges of the
logged-in user. (CVE-2012-2734)

A session fixation flaw was found in Cumin. An authenticated user able to
pre-set the Cumin session cookie in a victim's browser could possibly use
this flaw to steal the victim's session after they log into Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2735)

It was found that authenticated users could send a specially-crafted HTTP
POST request to Cumin that would cause it to submit a job attribute change
to Condor. This could be used to change internal Condor attributes,
including the Owner attribute, which could allow Cumin users to elevate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-3459)

It was discovered that Condor's file system authentication challenge
accepted directories with weak permissions (for example, world readable,
writable and executable permissions). If a user created a directory with
such permissions, a local attacker could rename it, allowing them to
execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user. (CVE-2012-3492)

It was discovered that Condor exposed private information in the data in
the ClassAds format served by condor\_startd. An unauthenticated user able
to connect to condor\_startd's port could request a ClassAd for a running
job, provided they could guess or brute-force the PID of the job. This
could expose the ClaimId which, if obtained, could be used to control the
job as well as start new jobs on the system. (CVE-2012-3493)

It was discovered that the ability to abort a job in Condor only required
WRITE authorization, instead of a combination of WRITE authorization and
job ownership. This could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass
intended restrictions and abort any idle job on the system. (CVE-2012-3491)

The above issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

This update also provides defense in depth patches for Condor. (BZ#848212,
BZ#835592, BZ#841173, BZ#843476)

These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 provide numerous
enhancements and bug fixes for the Grid component of MRG. Some highlights
include:

* Integration with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager via Deltacloud
* Role enforcement in Cumin
* Cumin authentication integration with LDAP
* Enhanced Red Hat HA integration managing multiple-schedulers nodes
* Generic local resource limits for partitionable slots
* Concurrency limit groups

Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, linked to in the
References section, for information on these changes.

## Solution

All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 are advised
to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. Condor
and Cumin must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-14 22:53:26 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team found that an unauthenticated user able to connect to the Condor startd TCP port could request ads, provided they could guess or brute force the PID of the process, due to how the GIVE_REQUEST_AD handler is registered.  The ads contains a lot of already-public information for users with READ privileges, however it also provides the ClaimId (as opposed to the PublicClaimId which truncates the full value of the ClaimID).  If an attacker could obtain the private ClaimId, they could use it to control the running job, and also start new jobs on the system.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 15:54:56 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:45:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1278 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1278.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:53:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1281 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1281.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 21:07:35 UTC  ``` Created condor tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 858867](show_bug.cgi?id=858867 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-3491 CVE-2012-3492 CVE-2012-3493 condor various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 22:01:02 UTC  ``` This has been resolved in upstream 7.6.10 and 7.8.4:  <https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/archive/condor-users/2012-September/msg00077.shtml>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c7)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-20 21:48:32 UTC  ``` Upstream git commit:  <http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/?p=condor.git;a=commitdiff;h=d2f33972>   ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1278)

## Topic

Updated Grid component packages that fix several security issues, add
various enhancements and fix multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise MRG 2 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Realtime, and Grid) is a next-generation
IT infrastructure for enterprise computing. MRG offers increased
performance, reliability, interoperability, and faster computing for
enterprise customers.

A number of unprotected resources (web pages, export functionality, image
viewing) were found in Cumin. An unauthenticated user could bypass intended
access restrictions, resulting in information disclosure. (CVE-2012-2680)

Cumin could generate weak session keys, potentially allowing remote
attackers to predict session keys and obtain unauthorized access to Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2681)

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws in Cumin could allow remote attackers
to inject arbitrary web script on a web page displayed by Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2683)

An SQL injection flaw in Cumin could allow remote attackers to manipulate
the contents of the back-end database via a specially-crafted URL.
(CVE-2012-2684)

When Cumin handled image requests, clients could request images of
arbitrary sizes. This could result in large memory allocations on the Cumin
server, leading to an out-of-memory condition. (CVE-2012-2685)

Cumin did not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. If an
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into the Cumin web interface,
into visiting a specially-crafted web page, it could lead to unauthorized
command execution in the Cumin web interface with the privileges of the
logged-in user. (CVE-2012-2734)

A session fixation flaw was found in Cumin. An authenticated user able to
pre-set the Cumin session cookie in a victim's browser could possibly use
this flaw to steal the victim's session after they log into Cumin.
(CVE-2012-2735)

It was found that authenticated users could send a specially-crafted HTTP
POST request to Cumin that would cause it to submit a job attribute change
to Condor. This could be used to change internal Condor attributes,
including the Owner attribute, which could allow Cumin users to elevate
their privileges. (CVE-2012-3459)

It was discovered that Condor's file system authentication challenge
accepted directories with weak permissions (for example, world readable,
writable and executable permissions). If a user created a directory with
such permissions, a local attacker could rename it, allowing them to
execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user. (CVE-2012-3492)

It was discovered that Condor exposed private information in the data in
the ClassAds format served by condor\_startd. An unauthenticated user able
to connect to condor\_startd's port could request a ClassAd for a running
job, provided they could guess or brute-force the PID of the job. This
could expose the ClaimId which, if obtained, could be used to control the
job as well as start new jobs on the system. (CVE-2012-3493)

It was discovered that the ability to abort a job in Condor only required
WRITE authorization, instead of a combination of WRITE authorization and
job ownership. This could allow an authenticated attacker to bypass
intended restrictions and abort any idle job on the system. (CVE-2012-3491)

The above issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product
Security Team.

This update also provides defense in depth patches for Condor. (BZ#848212,
BZ#835592, BZ#841173, BZ#843476)

These updated packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 provide numerous
enhancements and bug fixes for the Grid component of MRG. Some highlights
include:

* Integration with Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager via Deltacloud
* Role enforcement in Cumin
* Cumin authentication integration with LDAP
* Enhanced Red Hat HA integration managing multiple-schedulers nodes
* Generic local resource limits for partitionable slots
* Concurrency limit groups

Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Refer to
the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes document, linked to in the
References section, for information on these changes.

## Solution

All users of the Grid capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 are advised
to upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve the issues and add the
enhancements noted in the Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 Technical Notes. Condor
and Cumin must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-14 22:53:26 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team found that an unauthenticated user able to connect to the Condor startd TCP port could request ads, provided they could guess or brute force the PID of the process, due to how the GIVE_REQUEST_AD handler is registered.  The ads contains a lot of already-public information for users with READ privileges, however it also provides the ClaimId (as opposed to the PublicClaimId which truncates the full value of the ClaimID).  If an attacker could obtain the private ClaimId, they could use it to control the running job, and also start new jobs on the system.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 15:54:56 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:45:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1278 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1278.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:53:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1281 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1281.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 21:07:35 UTC  ``` Created condor tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 858867](show_bug.cgi?id=858867 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-3491 CVE-2012-3492 CVE-2012-3493 condor various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 22:01:02 UTC  ``` This has been resolved in upstream 7.6.10 and 7.8.4:  <https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/archive/condor-users/2012-September/msg00077.shtml>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c7)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-20 21:48:32 UTC  ``` Upstream git commit:  <http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/?p=condor.git;a=commitdiff;h=d2f33972>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-14 22:53:26 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team found that an unauthenticated user able to connect to the Condor startd TCP port could request ads, provided they could guess or brute force the PID of the process, due to how the GIVE_REQUEST_AD handler is registered.  The ads contains a lot of already-public information for users with READ privileges, however it also provides the ClaimId (as opposed to the PublicClaimId which truncates the full value of the ClaimID).  If an attacker could obtain the private ClaimId, they could use it to control the running job, and also start new jobs on the system.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 15:54:56 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:45:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1278 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1278.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:53:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1281 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1281.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 21:07:35 UTC  ``` Created condor tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 858867](show_bug.cgi?id=858867 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-3491 CVE-2012-3492 CVE-2012-3493 condor various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 22:01:02 UTC  ``` This has been resolved in upstream 7.6.10 and 7.8.4:  <https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/archive/condor-users/2012-September/msg00077.shtml>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=848222#c7)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-20 21:48:32 UTC  ``` Upstream git commit:  <http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/?p=condor.git;a=commitdiff;h=d2f33972>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Notification of upstream Condor security fixes

Just an FYI about an upstream Condor release yesterday that fixed a few
security issues:

CVE-2012-3490

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team reported that certain
functions in Condor (my_popenv_impl and my_spawnv in
src/condor_utils/my_popen.cpp) did not check the return value of setuid and
similar function calls. As a result, the subprocess could possibly be created
with root privileges instead of those of the intended user.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-3491>
<http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/?p=condor.git;a=commitdiff;h=94e84ce4>

NOTE: this flaw is only exploitable if the VMware support is compiled in; see
the Red Hat bug for further details.

CVE-2012-3491

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered that the ability
to abort a job in Condor only required WRITE authorization, instead of a
combination of WRITE authorization and job ownership. This could allow an
authenticated attacker to bypass intended restrictions and abort any idle job
on the system.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-3491>
<http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/?p=condor.git;a=commitdiff;h=1fff5d40>

CVE-2012-3492

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered that Condor's
file system authentication challenge accepted directories with weak permissions
(for example, world readable, writable and executable permissions). If a user
created a directory with such permissions, a local attacker could rename it,
allowing them to execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-3492>
<http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/?p=condor.git;a=commitdiff;h=1db67805>

CVE-2012-3493

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team found that an
unauthenticated user able to connect to the Condor startd TCP port could
request ads, provided they could guess or brute force the PID of the process,
due to how the GIVE_REQUEST_AD handler is registered.  The ads contains a lot
of already-public information for users with READ privileges, however it also
provides the ClaimId (as opposed to the PublicClaimId which truncates the full
value of the ClaimID).  If an attacker could obtain the private ClaimId, they
could use it to control the running job, and also start new jobs on the system.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-3493>
<http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/?p=condor.git;a=commitdiff;h=d2f33972>

Other upstream references:

<http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.8/9_3Stable_Release.html>
<http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.6/8_3Stable_Release.html>

These were fixed in upstream 7.8.4 and 7.6.10.

# 8.3 Stable Release Series 7.6

This is a stable release series of Condor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 7.6.x releases.
New features will be added in the 7.7.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

## Version 7.6.10

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.10 released on September 19, 2012.
* This release contains several important security fixes and all users
  should upgrade as soon as possible.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* *Security Item*: Some code that was no longer used was removed. The presence
  of this code could expose information which would allow an attacker to control
  another user's job. (CVE-2012-3493)
* *Security Item*: Some code that was no longer used was removed. The presence
  of this code could have lead to a Denial-of-Service attack which would allow
  an attacker to remove another user's idle job. (CVE-2012-3491)
* *Security Item*: Filesystem (FS) authentication was improved to check the UNIX
  permissions of the directory used for authentication. Without this, an
  attacker may have been able to impersonate another submitter on the same submit
  machine. (CVE-2012-3492)
* *Security Item*: Although not user-visible, there were multiple updates to
  remove places in the code where potential buffer overruns could occur, thus
  removing potential attacks. None were known to be exploitable.
* *Security Item*: Although not user-visible, there were updates to the code to
  improve error checking of system calls, removing some potential security
  threats. None were known to be exploitable.

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.6.9

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.9 released on August 15, 2012.
* *Security Item*: Fixed a critical problem with DNS handling.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* *Security Item*: Fixed a critical problem with DNS handling.

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.6.8

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.8 released on August 14, 2012. It was pulled from the web on August 15 due to a problem in how it was built, and should not be used. If you installed 7.6.8, please upgrade to 7.6.9 or later instead.

## Version 7.6.7

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.7 released on May 12, 2012.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* Added the ability to delay reconfig in daemon core, and applied to the
  *condor\_negotiator* to defer reconfiguration requests during the negotiation
  cycle until after the cycle completes.
  [(Ticket #2931).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2931)
* Fixed a potential infinite loop in the *condor\_gridmanager* for gt2
  grid universe jobs. If the GRAM jobmanager was listening on a different
  port than the *condor\_gridmanager* expected, the *condor\_gridmanager*
  would alternate between states GM\_REGISTER and GM\_RESTART,
  as visible in the *condor\_gridmanager* daemon log.
  [(Ticket #2916).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2916)
* Added logic to the *condor\_negotiator* that enables job preemption
  to properly respect hierarchical group quotas.
  [(Ticket #2570).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2570)
* Added logic to the *condor\_negotiator* to negotiate with full group
  quota instead of allocated-slots when no surplus sharing is in effect, to
  address a bug where groups could fail to claim weighted slots.
  [(Ticket #2958).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2958)
* Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.6.2 that affects jobs run via
  *glexec*.
  When *glexec* was configured in log-only mode,
  Condor failed to execute the job,
  but reported that the job exited with exit code 1.
  In such cases,
  the stderr of the job contained the following message:
  ```

  fdpass_recv error on new_sock_fd

  ```
  [(Ticket #2840).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2840)
* Fixed a rare bug in which if the *condor\_startd* was configured
  to use partitionable slots,
  it was possible for the *condor\_startd* to get partitioned into more slots
  than there were resources.
  That is, it was possible for a four cpu *condor\_startd*
  to split into five slots.
  [(Ticket #2816).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2816)
* Fixed a rare bug seen with parallel universe jobs,
  in which if a claim was removed as the *condor\_shadow* was starting up,
  all ranks of the job would never completely start.
  [(Ticket #2786).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2786)
* Fixed a bug that caused disk capacity to be under-reported
  on Windows platforms for drives with 1TB or more of free space.
  [(Ticket #2798).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2798)
* Fixed a bug that caused communication failure in some cases,
  after the failure of authentication, when authentication was configured
  to be optional.
  [(Ticket #2845).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2845)
* Fixed a bug in which if the configuration variable EVENT\_LOG   was
  set but the defined file was not writable,
  the user's job log would not be written to.
  This bug would have been observable with DAGMan.
  [(Ticket #2858).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2858)
* NorduGrid ARC LDAP servers that return attributes in an unexpected
  order no longer cause the *condor\_gridmanager* to exit.
  [(Ticket #2888).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2888)
* Condor failed to execute jobs when using *glexec*
  versions 0.9.0 through 0.9.5.
  [(Ticket #2907).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2907)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.6.6

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.6 released on January 17, 2012.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a memory leak affecting the *condor\_schedd* when the
  configuration variable
  EVENT\_LOG\_JOB\_AD\_INFORMATION\_ATTRS   and/or the submit
  description file command **job\_ad\_information\_attrs** were used.
  [(Ticket #2730).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2730)
* Fixed a bug in the Windows implementation of *condor\_chirp* that caused
  it to always return a status of -1073740777 for *condor\_chirp*
  commands that succeeded.
  [(Ticket #2739).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2739)
* Fixed a bug in the Windows implementation of *condor\_chirp* that caused
  the **put**, **whoami**, **getdir**, and **fetch**
  *condor\_chirp* commands to always fail.
  [(Ticket #2743).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2743)
* Fixed a bug in the checkpoint server that could cause it to abort and
  crash during a file rename operation on RHEL6 and newer versions.
  [(Ticket #2738).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2738)
* Fix a bug introduced in Condor version 7.6.5,
  that could cause the *condor\_schedd* to exit with the following error:
  ```

  ERROR "Send_Signal: sent unsafe pid (0)" at line 5492 in file
  /home/condor/execute/dir_10444/userdir/src/condor_daemon_core.V6/daemon_core.cpp

  ```
  [(Ticket #2736).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2736)
* Fixed the example Linux startup script condor.boot.rpm
  to no longer assume that the contents of file /var/run will
  persist across a reboot,
  or that environment variable USER is set.
  [(Ticket #2133).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2133)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.6.5

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.5 released on December 28, 2011.
* Restored the semantics of GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP   to the
  behavior it exhibited before Hierarchical Group Quotas were introduced
  in Condor version 7.5.6.
  That behavior has submitters with no accounting group,
  which are listed as <none>, negotiate last.
  And, in addition, any accounting groups with GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP
  enabled negotiate both normally and then also along with the
  submitters with no accounting group.
  For Condor versions 7.5.6 through 7.6.4, configuration variable
  GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP (or GROUP\_AUTOREGROUP\_<groupname>)
  was a synonym for
  GROUP\_ACCEPT\_SURPLUS
  (or GROUP\_ACCEPT\_SURPLUS\_<groupname>).
  They now implement distinct features,
  and it is not legal to set both to True in the configuration
  for the *condor\_negotiator*.
  [(Ticket #2679).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2679)

New Features:

* Added explicit support for Linux kernels with a major version number of 3,
  to detect and utilize the load average information.
  [(Ticket #2579).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2579)

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a bug in Chirp when using absolute file paths. This bug caused
  most MPI jobs to fail in the parallel universe.
  [(Ticket #2630).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2630)
* Fixed a bug in mapping users using the CERTIFICATE\_MAPFILE
  mechanism, where entries using the NTSSPI method on Windows would not be mapped
  using the map file, but would instead fall back to just the user name.
  [(Ticket #2709).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2709)
* Fixed a hierarchical accounting groups bug in which
  the *condor\_schedd* did not properly restore accounting group
  information to submitters on a restart of the *condor\_schedd*,
  and therefore negotiated for and allocated machines incorrectly.
  [(Ticket #2705).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2705)
* The Windows installer had a bad value set for the configuration variable
  JAVA\_CLASSPATH\_SEPARATOR  , causing java universe jobs to fail.
  [(Ticket #2586).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2586)
* HDFS was not listed in the default
  DC\_DAEMON\_LIST, so the *condor\_hdfs* daemon exited
  shortly after being started,
  and the HDFS service did not run.
  [(Ticket #849).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=849)
* File System (FS) authentication now works when /tmp
  is on a Btrfs file system. Previously, authentication failed.
  [(Ticket #2583).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2583)
* Fixed a bug that caused a failure to start jobs when using PrivSep
  and supplemental group process tracking.
  Prior to Condor version 7.6.4, this problem
  only occurred when USE\_CLONE\_TO\_CREATE\_PROCESSES   was set
  to False.
  In Condor version 7.6.4, the problem occurred regardless of the setting
  of this configuration variable.
  [(Ticket #2658).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2658)
* Fixed a performance problem on Windows platforms
  that caused claim activations to
  fail when more than about 8 jobs were already running on that machine.
  [(Ticket #2441).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2441)
* Fixed a bug in which the submit event would not be written to the user
  job log,
  if the job was submitted with the **-remote** or **-spool** option to
  *condor\_submit*.
  [(Ticket #2569).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2569)
* Fixed a bug that caused *condor\_q* with the **-analyze** option
  to fail,
  if a job or a machine ClassAd contained a string attribute ending in
  a backslash.
  This resulted in output of the error message
  ```

    Unable to process machine ClassAds

  ```
  or
  ```

    Unable to process job ClassAd

  ```
  [(Ticket #2603).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2603)
* Fixed a bug that caused the *condor\_startd* to crash when being
  reconfigured,
  if the reconfigure caused the *condor\_startd* to remove
  a running Daemon ClassAd Hook job.
  [(Ticket #2636).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2636)
* Configuration variables of the form MAX\_<SUBSYS>\_<LEVEL>\_LOG
  now work properly on 32-bit Linux platforms.
  Previously, the corresponding log file would grow without bound.
  [(Ticket #2638).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2638)
* Fixed a bug in which Condor would fail to properly detect that it
  was running as Local System for non-English versions of Windows.
  The bug caused Condor to fail to run jobs on the slot accounts.
  [(Ticket #2642).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2642)
* Fixed a bug in the Windows version of Condor,
  in which the transfer of output failed due to the use of the Everyone account,
  which lacks read permission.
  Usage of the Everyone account occurred as a fallback,
  when the account name failed to exist because it
  included the domain of the local submit machine.
  The fix adds the same capability as exists on Linux platforms,
  which uses the user name without the domain.
  [(Ticket #2643).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2643)
* Fixed a bug in which job submission via Condor-C could fail,
  because it did not convert account names to fully qualified (including domain)
  before comparing to see
  if the current account was the same as the desired account.
  [(Ticket #2644).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2644)
* Fixed a bug in which use of the submit command
  **transfer\_input\_files** did not work for directories on
  Windows platforms.
  [(Ticket #2387).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2387)
* Fixed a bug that could cause a failure in cleaning up job processes
  when using *glexec* after a restart of the *condor\_master* daemon.
  [(Ticket #2614).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2614)
* Fixed a bug in *condor\_power* that caused it to fail when
  operating on a machine with a 15-byte subnet mask string.
  [(Ticket #2651).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2651)
* Fixed a bug that could cause the *condor\_schedd* to no longer start
  idle jobs or send ClassAds to the *condor\_collector*.
  [(Ticket #2647).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2647)
* Fixed a bug that could cause the *condor\_schedd* to crash if a
  hold reason contained a percent character (`%`),
  and the user log for the job was in XML format.
  [(Ticket #2660).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2660)
* Fixed a Windows 7 and Vista bug in *condor\_softkill*,
  in which it would fail to kill the target process,
  when run by a Personal Condor inside a System Condor slot account.
  [(Ticket #2677).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2677)
* A possible fix has been made for a problem in which the
  CCB-enabled daemon took an unexpectedly long time to timeout when
  reading from the CCB server. Additional information is logged
  to help identify the problem if it still remains.
  [(Ticket #2695).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2695)
* Fixed a bug in *condor\_dagman* that occurred when
  dealing with nested splices.
  *condor\_dagman* incorrectly issued a parse error and exited
  in the case where the parent splice contained only splices, and no nodes jobs.
  [(Ticket #1751).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=1751)
* Fixed a bug that caused grid universe jobs submitted via SOAP to
  be held when trying to write output files into the spool directory.
  [(Ticket #2568).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2568)
* Fixed a bug that caused *condor\_credd* and possibly other
  daemons to crash when the file used for CERTIFICATE\_MAPFILE
  contained more than 80 entries.
  [(Ticket #2409).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2409)
* Fixed a bug that caused hibernation to fail on certain Linux platforms
  for certain hibernation states.
  To work correctly on these Linux platforms,
  the plug-in needs the command line arguments defined by
  HIBERNATION\_PLUGIN\_ARGS   when initially invoked,
  as well as for other invocations.
  [(Ticket #2561).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2561)
* The *condor\_schedd* now aborts the claim and reschedules the job,
  if it does not hear from the *condor\_startd* for longer than the job
  lease duration.
  [(Ticket #2706).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2706)
* Fixed some bugs in the renewing of CREAM job leases. Before, the
  *condor\_gridmanager* could fail to renew the leases or attempt to set
  lease expirations in the past.
  [(Ticket #2351).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2351)
  [(Ticket #2455).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2455)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.6.4

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.4 released on October 21, 2011.

New Features:

* The new Windows-only *condor\_rmdir* was included in Condor version 7.6.0,
  but there was no version history entry for this introduced tool at release.
  This item attempts to correct that oversight,
  as well as identify that usage of *condor\_rmdir*,
  instead of the built-in Windows *rmdir*,
  is enabled by default.
  *condor\_rmdir* worked correctly in Condor version 7.6.0,
  contained a bug in Condor version 7.6.1,
  and was fixed in Condor version 7.6.2.
  [(Ticket #1877).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=1877)

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* The new configuration variable <Keyword>\_HOOK\_JOB\_EXIT\_TIMEOUT
  defines the number of seconds that the *condor\_starter* will wait
  before continuing with a shut down,
  if a hook defined by <Keyword>\_HOOK\_JOB\_EXIT has not completed.
  The addition of this configuration variable fixes the bug described below.
  [(Ticket #2543).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2543)
* The new configuration variable SKIP\_WINDOWS\_LOGON\_NETWORK
  is a boolean value which specifies whether the Windows
  LOGON\_NETWORK authentication is skipped or not.
  If skipped, Condor tries LOGON\_INTERACTIVE authentication first.
  The addition of this configuration variable fixes the bug described below.
  [(Ticket #2549).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2549)
* The new configuration variable SHADOW\_RUN\_UNKNOWN\_USER\_JOBS
  defaults to False.
  When True,
  it allows the *condor\_shadow* daemon to run jobs remotely submitted from
  users not in the local password file.
  [(Ticket #2004).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2004)

Bugs Fixed:

* Implemented proper support of values greater than or equal to 2 GBytes
  set for the configuration variable MAX\_<SUBSYS>\_LOG  .
  [(Ticket #2471).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2471)
* Updated the *condor\_negotiator* daemon's assessment of pool size
  to properly take partitionable slots into account.
  See section [3.13.9](3_13Setting_Up.html#sec:Configuring-SMP) for an explanation of
  partitionable slots on SMP machines.
  [(Ticket #2440).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2440)
* Provided an informative error message
  when the *condor\_userprio* tool cannot locate the *condor\_negotiator* daemon.
  [(Ticket #2478).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2478)
* *condor\_userprio* and the *condor\_negotiator* daemon
  did not correctly handle the names of submitters,
  when these names exceeded 63 characters in length.
  The fix handles submitter names of arbitrary length.
  [(Ticket #2445).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2445)
* Removed a spurious boolean flag reset in *condor\_q*,
  which resulted in an order dependency between the command line arguments
  **-long** and **-format**.
  [(Ticket #2498).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2498)
* Fixed a bug in which a graceful shutdown of a *condor\_startd*
  did not correctly handle jobs using job deferral
  which have landed on an execute machine but have not yet
  reached their deferral time.
  These jobs would appear to be running, despite the lack of
  a *condor\_starter* daemon.
  These jobs now correctly transition to the idle state.
  [(Ticket #2486).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2486)
* Corrected a hierarchical group quota bug in which
  the user accounting mechanism in the *condor\_negotiator* daemon allowed
  submitter records to be deleted,
  if the submitter's priority factor was explicitly set and
  the value was equal to that defined by DEFAULT\_PRIO\_FACTOR.
  [(Ticket #2442).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2442)
* Fixed CPU detection on Windows, such that the correct number of CPUs
  is detected when there are more than 32 CPUs.
  [(Ticket #2381).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2381)
* Fixed a memory leak in the *condor\_negotiator*,
  caused by the failure to
  free memory returned from some calls to param\_without\_default().
  [(Ticket #2299).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2299)
* Jobs run via *glexec* always had their PATH environment
  variable cleared. Now, if PATH was specified for the job,
  in any of the ways that job environment may be specified,
  this setting is used.
  [(Ticket #2096).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2096)
* Fixed an infinite loop that could happen in Condor daemons
  shortly after the receipt of a new connection.
  This problem was introduced in Condor version 7.5.6.
  [(Ticket #2413).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2413)
* Fixed a problem in *condor\_hdfs* that caused it to exit shortly
  after starting up,
  if the configuration variables
  HDFS\_DENY, HOSTDENY\_WRITE, or HOSTDENY\_READ
  were not defined.
  Previously, if HDFS\_DENY was
  not defined, HOSTDENY\_WRITE and HOSTDENY\_READ
  were used to build the deny list.
  Now DENY\_WRITE and DENY\_READ are also used.
  [(Ticket #2414).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2414)
* Removed an extra copy of the java files required to run gt4 and gt42
  grid universe jobs. This does not affect Condor's operation.
  [(Ticket #2435).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2435)
* Fixed a problem that caused the *condor\_schedd* to crash when
  writing to some user logs with specific names. The specific names that
  caused crashes are not easy to describe.
  [(Ticket #2439).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2439)
* Fixed a bug in which the *condor\_schedd* failed to start up
  when any job ClassAd attribute value contained the ASCII character 255.
  [(Ticket #2450).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2450)
* Fixed a bug in which *condor\_preen* failed to honor the
  **-remove** option, and would always remove lock files.
  [(Ticket #2497).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2497)
* *condor\_preen* expected an old format for local lock file paths;
  it now understands the proper format.
  [(Ticket #2496).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2496)
* *condor\_preen* would EXCEPT when processing multiple
  subdirectories for local locks.
  [(Ticket #2495).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2495)
* In 32-bit Condor binaries, the ImageSize of processes larger than
  4 GBytes was reported as 4 GBytes. This limit has been raised to 4095 GBytes.
* **vm** universe jobs using Xen or KVM would fail to start,
  if the disk image files were transferred from the submit machine
  and the default value defined for LIBVIRT\_XML\_SCRIPT   was used.
  The script did not provide absolute path names for the files.
  [(Ticket #2511).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2511)
* Fixed a bug in which a completed Xen or KVM **vm** universe
  job's modified disk image files would not be transferred back
  to the submit machine.
  [(Ticket #2530).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2530)
* Fixed a bug in which a *condor\_starter* configured to use job hooks
  could fail to run a job,
  but not wait for the job exit hook to complete before exiting.
  The bug fix introduces the new configuration variable
  <Keyword>\_HOOK\_JOB\_EXIT\_TIMEOUT  ,
  which defines the number of seconds the *condor\_starter* will wait
  before continuing with a shut down,
  if the job exit hook has not completed.
  [(Ticket #2543).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2543)
* In Condor version 7.5.4, an improvement was made to avoid reliance on
  the machine specified by NEGOTIATOR\_HOST
  matching a reverse DNS look up of the *condor\_negotiator*.
  However, this improvement was not made to the dedicated scheduler,
  so matchmaking of parallel jobs was still subject to the
  problems associated with the old algorithm.
  Now, the dedicated scheduler benefits from the same improved algorithm as the
  non-dedicated scheduler.
  [(Ticket #2540).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2540)
* Occasionally there have been problems with Windows
  LOGON\_NETWORK authentication,
  leading to users being locked out from their account.
  The new configuration variable SKIP\_WINDOWS\_LOGON\_NETWORK,
  when set to True,
  fixes the problem by allowing this mechanism to be skipped entirely,
  instead proceeding straight to the LOGON\_INTERACTIVE authentication.
  This bug only affected users using the *condor\_credd*.
  [(Ticket #2549).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2549)
* Condor now correctly groups CREAM jobs based on how CREAM servers
  authorize and map them.
  The servers map them based on X.509 proxy subject name
  and first VOMS attribute.
  Previously, all VOMS attributes were considered.
  This could cause unexpected behavior due to the aliasing of CREAM leases
  and proxy delegations.
  [(Ticket #2271).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2271)
* Communication errors in the job lease renewal protocol were
  sometimes not correctly handled. This resulted in the job being
  killed.
  [(Ticket #2563).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2563)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* The manual now contains a manual page for *condor\_rmdir*,
  a Windows only replacement for the built-in Windows *rmdir*
  introduced in Condor version 7.6.0.

## Version 7.6.3

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.3 released on August 23, 2011.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a bug causing parallel universe jobs to be preempted upon
  renewal of the job lease,
  which by default happens within 20 minutes.
  This meant that essentially no parallel universe job that took
  longer than 20 minutes would ever finish.
  [(Ticket #2317).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2317)
* When the specified job requirements expression contained a
  reference to RequestMemory, there was inconsistent behavior:
  in some cases the default RequestMemory requirements were
  suppressed, and in other cases not. Now, the default
  RequestMemory requirements are always suppressed when there
  are explicit references to RequestMemory in the job
  requirements.
* Fixed a bug that could cause Condor to crash when using
  the Local Credential Mapping Service (LCMAPS) with
  GSI authentication.
  [(Ticket #2340).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2340)
* Fixed a bug that caused the *condor\_collector* daemon to crash
  upon receiving a CCB command,
  when ENABLE\_CCB\_SERVER   was changed from True to False
  without restarting the daemon.
  [(Ticket #2357).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2357)
* The GT2 GAHP no longer consumes all of the CPU when compiled
  with threaded Globus libraries.
  [(Ticket #2345).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2345)
* Fixed a problem introduced in Condor version 7.5.6,
  which led to local lock files for user log locking always being created
  whether or
  not ENABLE\_USERLOG\_LOCKING was set to False.
  [(Ticket #2116).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2116)
* Installation as a service by the MSI installer on Windows platforms
  now sets the default of Automatic Delayed.
  [(Ticket #2318).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2318)
* In PrivSep mode, if started as root,
  the *condor\_master* re-executes itself as the condor user.
  Previously, supplementary groups were preserved.
  Now supplementary groups are cleared and set to the list of groups
  to which the condor user belongs.
  [(Ticket #2376).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2376)
* Fixed a bug where setting DAGMAN\_PROHIBIT\_MULTI\_JOBS   to
  True caused SUBDAGs to stop working.
  [(Ticket #2331).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2331)
* Fixed a bug that caused scheduler universe jobs submitted via
  Condor-C or *condor\_submit* **-spool** to be held and be unable to run.
  The hold reason given was File <filename> is missing or not executable.
  [(Ticket #2396).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2396)
* *condor\_submit* now exits with an error,
  if the command hold = True is in the submit description file
  when using **-spool** or **-remote** as command-line arguments.
  This combination of settings resulted in jobs being unable to run.
  [(Ticket #2398).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2398)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.6.2

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.2 released on July 19, 2011.

New Features:

* Improved how *condor\_dagman* deals with certain parse errors:
  missing node name or submit description file in JOB lines.
  Also, *condor\_dagman*
  now prints DAG input file lines as they are parsed,
  if the debug verbosity setting is 6 or above,
  as set with the *condor\_submit\_dag* command line option **-debug**.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a bug in the *condor\_negotiator* that impacted the processing
  of machine RANK such that *condor\_startd* RANK
  preemption only occurred if the preempting user had sufficient user priority
  to claim another machine.
* *condor\_ssh\_to\_job* did not work on systems using the
  dash shell for */bin/sh*.
* *condor\_ssh\_to\_job* now works with jobs that are run via
  *glexec*. Previously, it did not.
* When *glexec* was configured with linger=on,
  the *condor\_starter* would become unresponsive for the duration of the job.
  For jobs longer than the value set by configuration variable
  NOT\_RESPONDING\_TIMEOUT,
  this caused the job to be aborted.
  This also prevented job resource usage monitoring from working
  while the job was running.
* Fixed a bug in hierarchical group quotas that caused
  a warning to be logged, despite correct implementation.
* *condor\_preen* now properly respects the convention that
  the **-debug** option causes dprintf() logging to stderr.
* Fixed a problem introduced in Condor version 7.5.5
  that could cause the *condor\_schedd* to crash when a job was removed
  during negotiation or when an idle parallel universe job left the queue.
* Fixed a problem that sometimes caused the *condor\_procd* to die.
  The chain of events for this fixed bug were that
  the *condor\_startd* killed the *condor\_starter* due to unresponsiveness,
  and the *condor\_procd* would die.
  Then *condor\_startd* logged the message
  ProcD has failed and the *condor\_startd* exited.
* Fixed a problem introduced in Condor version 7.6.1
  that caused the *condor\_shadow* to crash without successfully putting the job
  on hold when the user log could not be opened for writing.
* *condor\_history* no longer crashes when given a constraint expression
  longer than 512 characters.
* PBS and LSF grid jobs that arrive in a queue via Condor-C
  or remote submission again work properly.
* Fix a bug that can cause the *condor\_gridmanager* to crash
  when a CREAM job ClassAd is missing the X509UserProxy attribute.
* Fix a bug that caused CREAM jobs to have incomplete input files,
  if the *condor\_gridmanager* crashed during transfer of those input files.
* Fix a bug in *condor\_submit* that caused grid jobs intended for
  CREAM services whose names contain extra dashes to become held.
* Fixed a bug in which *condor\_submit* would try,
  but fail to open the Deltacloud password file,
  when the file name was dependent on an expression specified with $$().
* If the Owner attribute was not set in the ClassAd associated
  with a cluster of jobs,
  shared spooled executables were not correctly cleaned up.
* Fixed a bug for 64-bit versions of Windows in which the
  user condor-reuse-slot<N> showed up on the login screen.
* Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.5,
  which changed the default value of the configuration variable
  INVALID\_LOG\_FILES   from the empty set to a file called core.
  This resulted in core files being removed unexpectedly by *condor\_preen*,
  and that complicated debugging of Condor.
  Previous behavior has been restored.
* Fixed a bug existing since Condor version 7.5.5 on Windows platforms.
  The installer installed Java jar files in the correct `$(BIN)` directory,
  while the value for the configuration variable
  JAVA\_CLASSPATH\_DEFAULT utilized the obsolete `$(LIB)`
  directory.
  The installer now correctly sets JAVA\_CLASSPATH\_DEFAULT
  to the `$(BIN)` directory.
* Fixed a problem causing Condor to fail to start when
  privsep was enabled and the environment had any variables
  containing newlines.

Known Bugs:

* For Condor versions 7.6.2, 7.6.1, and 7.6.0,
  a bug causes parallel universe jobs to be preempted upon
  renewal of the job lease,
  which by default will happen within 20 minutes,
  essentially meaning that no parallel universe job that takes
  longer than 20 minutes can ever finish.
  The work around for this bug is to place the following
  configuration variable in the configuration of the submit machine:
  ```

    STARTD_SENDS_ALIVES = FALSE

  ```
  A *condor\_reconfig* is required,
  after which the preempted parallel universe jobs will then be
  able to run to completion.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.6.1

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.1 released on June 3, 2011.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* A bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.5 caused the *condor\_schedd*
  to die when its attempt to claim a slot for a parallel universe job
  was rejected by the *condor\_startd*.
* *condor\_q* **-analyze** failed to provide detailed analysis of
  the job's requirements expression when the expression contained ClassAd
  function calls in some cases.
* Fixed an incorrect exit code from *condor\_q*
  when invoked with the **-name** option and using Quill.
* Fixed a segmentation fault bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.5,
  in the checkpoint and restart of jobs using compressed checkpoint images
  under the standard universe.
  By default, Condor will not compress checkpoints under the standard universe.
  Jobs which do not compress their checkpoints were immune to this bug.
  Compressed checkpoints are only available in 32-bit versions of Condor.
  Generation of checkpoints in 64-bit versions of Condor are unaffected.
* In Condor version 7.6.0, the *condor\_schedd* would create a
  spool directory for every job. The corrected and previous behavior
  has now been restored,
  which is to create a spool directory only when needed.
* Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.5.2,
  that caused the *condor\_negotiator* daemon to crash
  if any machine ClassAds contained cyclical attribute references.
* Fixed a bug that caused usage by **nice\_user** jobs to
  be charged to the user directly rather than `nice-user.*user*'.
  This bug was introduced in the 7.5 series.
* Fixed bugs in the RPM init script that could cause some
  shutdown failures to be unreported,
  and they could cause status requests,
  such as service condor status,
  to always report Condor as inactive.
* Fixed a bug in the *condor\_gridmanager* that could cause a crash
  when a grid type **amazon** job was missing required attributes.
* Fixed bug in the *condor\_shadow*, in which it would treat
  the closed socket to the execute machine as an error,
  after both it had asked for the claim to be deactivated and the
  *condor\_schedd* daemon was busy.
  As a result, a busy *condor\_schedd* could result in the job being re-run.
* The matchmaking attributes
  SubmitterUserResourcesInUse and RemoteUserResourcesInUse
  no longer ignore SlotWeight, if used by the *condor\_negotiator*.
* On Windows, the *condor\_kbdd* daemon was missing changes to the
  port on which the *condor\_startd* was listening.
  This resulted in failure of the *condor\_kbdd* to send updates in
  keyboard and mouse activity,
  further causing the failure of policy implementation that relied upon
  knowledge of the activity.
* Fixed a bug present throughout ClassAds,
  in which expressions expecting a floating point value returned an error,
  if the expression actually evaluated to a boolean.
  This is most common in machine RANK expressions.
* Fixed a bug in the *condor\_negotiator* daemon,
  which caused a crash if the *condor\_negotiator* was reconfigured
  during a negotiation cycle,
  but only if hierarchical group quotas were in use.
* Fixed a bug in which when submitting a job into the *condor\_schedd*
  remotely, or with spooling,
  the file transfer plug-ins activated on the submit machine
  and pulled down all the specified URLs in the transfer list
  to the spool directory.
  This behavior has been changed so that URLs are only downloaded
  when the job is actually running with a *condor\_starter* above it.
  This is usually on an execute node, but could also be in the local universe.
* Removed the requirement that the Condor GAHP needs DAEMON-level
  authorization access to the *condor\_gridmanager*.
* On Windows platforms only,
  fixed a bug that could cause a sporadic access violation
  when a Condor daemon spawned another process.
* Fixed a bug that would cause the *condor\_startd* to
  incorrectly report Benchmarking as its activity, instead of Idle
  when there was a problem launching the benchmarking programs.
* Fixed a bug in which the *condor\_startd* can get stuck in a loop,
  trying to execute an invalid, non-existent Daemon ClassAd Hook job.
* Fixed a bug in which the dedicated scheduler did not correctly
  deactivate claims,
  tending to result in jobs that appear to move back and forth between
  the Idle and Running states,
  with the *condor\_shadow* daemon exiting each time with status 108.

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.6.0

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.6.0 released on April 19, 2011.
* Prior to Condor version 7.5.0, commenting out PREEN in the
  default configuration file disabled *condor\_preen*.
  Starting in Condor version 7.5.0,
  there was an internal default value for PREEN, so if
  the configuration variable was not set in any configuration file,
  *condor\_preen* would still run.
  To disable this functionality, PREEN can be explicitly set to
  nothing.

New Features:

* Condor can now create and manage virtual machine instances in a
  cloud service via Deltacloud. This is done via the new
  **deltacloud** grid type in the grid universe.
  See section [5.3.9](5_3Grid_Universe.html#sec:Deltacloud) for details.
* Improved scalability of submission of cream grid type jobs.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* The new configuration variable DELTACLOUD\_GAHP   specifies
  where the *deltacloud\_gahp* binary is located. This binary is used to
  manage deltacloud grid type jobs in the grid universe.
  In a normal Condor installation, the value should be
  $(SBIN)/deltacloud\_gahp.
* Several new job ClassAd attributes have been added to support
  the deltacloud grid type in the grid universe.
  These attributes are taken from the submit description file:
  DeltacloudUsername,
  DeltacloudPasswordFile,
  DeltacloudImageId,
  DeltacloudRealmId,
  DeltacloudHardwareProfile,
  DeltacloudHardwareProfileCpu,
  DeltacloudHardwareProfileMemory,
  DeltacloudHardwareProfileStorage,
  DeltacloudKeyname, and
  DeltacloudUserData.
  These attributes are set by Condor when the instance runs:
  DeltacloudAvailableActions,
  DeltacloudPrivateNetworkAddresses,
  DeltacloudPublicNetworkAddresses.
  See section [5.3.9](5_3Grid_Universe.html#sec:Deltacloud) for details of running jobs under
  Deltacloud, and see section [10](10_Appendix_A.html#sec:Job-ClassAd-Attributes)
  for definitions of these job ClassAd attributes.
* The configuration variable JAVA\_MAXHEAP\_ARGUMENT
  has been removed.
  This means that Java universe jobs will now run with the JVM's
  default maximum heap setting,
  unless specified otherwise by the administrator using the configuration
  of JAVA\_EXTRA\_ARGUMENTS  ,
  or by the job via
  **java\_vm\_args** in the submit description file
  as described in section [2.8](2_8Java_Applications.html#sec:Java).
* The configuration variable TRUST\_UID\_DOMAIN
  was set to True in the default condor\_config.local
  in the rpm and Debian packages. This is no longer the case.
  This setting will therefore use the default value False.
* The configuration variable NEGOTIATOR\_INTERVAL   was set
  to 20 in the default condor\_config.local in the rpm and
  Debian packages. This is no longer the case. This setting
  therefore will use the default value 60.

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a bug in *condor\_dagman* that caused it to fail when in recovery
  mode in the face of a specific combination of node job failures with
  retries.
* Fixed a bug that resulted in the spooled user log not being
  fetched by *condor\_transfer\_data*. Prior to Condor version 7.5.4, this
  problem affected spooled jobs submitted with an explicit list of
  output files to transfer. In Condor version 7.5.4, this problem also
  affected spooled jobs that auto-detected output files.
* When a job is submitted with the **-spool** option to *condor\_submit*,
  the *condor\_schedd* now correctly writes the submit event to the user log
  in its spool directory.
  Previously, it would try to write the event using the user
  log path given to *condor\_submit* by the user,
  which *condor\_submit* may not have access to.
* Fixed a file descriptor leak in the *condor\_vm-gahp*. The leak would
  cause the daemon to fail if a VMware job ran for more than 16 hours on a
  Linux machine.
* Fixed a bug in *condor\_dagman* that caused it to treat any dollar
  sign in the log file name of a node job's submit description file
  as an illegal *condor\_dagman* macro.
  Now only the sequence of characters $( delimits a macro.

Known Bugs:

* There are two known issues related to the automatic creation
  of checkpoints with the Condor checkpointing library in
  Condor version 7.6.0.
  The first is that compression of
  standalone checkpoints is disabled for 32-bit binaries.
  It was always disabled previously, for 64-bit binaries.
  A standalone checkpoint is one that is run outside
  of Condor's standard universe. The second problem has to do with compressed
  32-bit checkpoint files within the standard universe.
  If a user requests a compressed 32-bit checkpoint in the standard universe,
  the resulting checkpoint will not be compressed.
  As with standalone checkpoints, this has never been supported
  in 64-bit binaries. We hope to fix both problems in
  Condor version 7.6.1.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

# 9.3 Stable Release Series 7.8

This is a stable release series of HTCondor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 7.8.x releases.
New features will be added in the 7.9.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

## Version 7.8.8

Release Notes:

* HTCondor version 7.8.8 released on March 28, 2013.

New Features:

* When using *glexec*, HTCondor now automatically retries
  each *glexec* operation if *glexec* exits with an error
  code that is likely to be caused by a transient error, such as a
  communication error with the mapping service. Previously, any
  *glexec* error would cause the job to be put on hold. Now, the
  job will only go on hold if the maximum number of *glexec*
  retries is exceeded.
  [(Ticket #2415).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2415)

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* The new configuration variable GLEXEC\_RETRIES   is an
  integer value that specifies the maximum number of times to retry a
  call to *glexec* when *glexec* exits with status 202 or
  203, error codes that indicate a possible transient error condition.
  The default number of retries is 3.
  [(Ticket #2415).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2415)
* The new configuration variable GLEXEC\_RETRY\_DELAY   is
  an integer value that specifies the minimum number of seconds to
  wait between retries of a failed call to *glexec*.
  The default is 5 seconds.
  The actual delay to be used is determined by a random exponential
  backoff algorithm that chooses a delay with a minimum of
  the value of GLEXEC\_RETRY\_DELAY
  and a maximum of 100 times that value.
  [(Ticket #2415).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2415)

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a bug that caused the *condor\_gridmanager* to frequently
  delegate the X.509 proxy for jobs of the condor grid type to the remote
  *condor\_schedd* when the delegated proxy's lifetime is not limited.
  This occurred when configuration variable
  DELEGATE\_JOB\_GSI\_CREDENTIALS\_LIFETIME
  or job ClassAd attribute DelegateJobGSICredentialsLifetime was set to 0.
  [(Ticket #3395).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3395)
* Fixed a bug in *condor\_advertise* that could cause failure to
  publish ClassAds to *condor\_collector* daemons other than the first
  one in the list of *condor\_collector* daemons.
  [(Ticket #3404).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3404)
* (This bug was fixed in HTCondor version 7.8.4.)
  *condor\_userlog* no longer ignores ULOG\_JOB\_RECONNECT\_FAILED events.
  [(Ticket #3215).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3215)
* Fixed a bug that caused cream grid jobs to become held with a
  HoldReason attribute stating
  ```

  "CREAM error: Transfer failed: globus_ftp_client:
    an invalid value for url was used"

  ```
  when the jobs did not have any input or output files to transfer.
  [(Ticket #3415).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3415)
* Fixed a bug that could cause HTCondor daemons to abort on
  *condor\_reconfig* when the value of configuration variable
  STATISTICS\_WINDOW\_SECONDS   was reduced.
  [(Ticket #3443).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3443)
* Fixed a bug that could cause daemons using CCB to fail to reconnect to
  the CCB server after becoming disconnected. This condition would cause the
  daemon to become unreachable via CCB until the daemon was restarted.
  [(Ticket #3476).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3476)
* If *condor\_shared\_port* was using a dynamic port and the
  *condor\_master* was using the shared port,
  then if *condor\_shared\_port* died, all
  subsequent attempts to restart it on a different port failed.
  [(Ticket #3478).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3478)
* The *nordugrid\_gahp* no longer exits if the job ClassAd contains
  a bad NordugridRSL attribute value.
  [(Ticket #3495).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3495)
* Fixed a bug that caused the command-line arguments of grid universe
  jobs of grid type cream
  to be ignored if specified using the new quoting syntax in
  the submit description file.
  [(Ticket #3473).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3473)
* Reduced the likelihood of a problem that caused the
  *condor\_master* to restart some of its children after a recent
  reconfiguration, because the *condor\_master* incorrectly concluded that the
  children were hung.
  [(Ticket #3510).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3510)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.8.7

Release Notes:

* HTCondor version 7.8.7 released on December 18, 2012.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a bug wherein running the *condor\_suspend* command on a scheduler
  universe job would cause the *condor\_schedd* to crash.
  [(Ticket #3259).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3259)
* HTCondor now places EC2 jobs on hold when they fail to authenticate,
  rather than leaving them and other jobs with the same authentication tokens
  idle indefinitely.
  [(Ticket #2274).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2274)
* For EC2 resource jobs within the grid universe,
  HTCondor now only destroys the user's half of the SSH keypair
  when sure that the instance has terminated. This prevents transient
  problems from rendering an instance permanently inaccessible.
  [(Ticket #3289).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3289)
* For EC2 resource jobs within the grid universe,
  HTCondor no longer generates an SSH keypair if the user did not
  request one.
  [(Ticket #3061).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3061)
* HTCondor no longer generates SSH keypair names that are incompatible
  with OpenStack v4 (Essex).
  [(Ticket #3060).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3060)
* Jobs that were submitted with *condor\_submit* **-spool**
  and failed during submission were
  left indefinitely in the queue in the Hold state.
  This has been fixed, such that these jobs are removed from the queue.
  In addition, the *condor\_schedd* daemon will periodically
  check for jobs that have
  been in Hold state due to failed file transfer for at least twelve hours;
  these jobs will be removed from the queue.
  [(Ticket #3200).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3200)
* Fixed a problem where an *ssh\_to\_job* or an interactive job
  session would be terminated prematurely if the execute machine
  was configured to track process trees via a dedicated login.
  That is, when configuration variable
  DEDICATED\_EXECUTE\_ACCOUNT\_REGEXP   is being used.
  [(Ticket #3232).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3232)
* ClassAd functions int() and real() now ignore
  trailing characters within
  a string argument that contains a valid number.
  [(Ticket #3102).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3102)
* Contrary to the intended behavior, jobs run via *glexec* did not
  get put on hold shortly before their proxy expired.
  [(Ticket #3283).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3283)
* Starting in version 7.8.0, when using *glexec*,
  the job was put on hold shortly after the user's proxy was refreshed.
  The incorrect, but stated hold reason was, "Proxy about to expire."
  [(Ticket #3280).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3280)
* The configuration variable
  DELEGATE\_JOB\_GSI\_CREDENTIALS\_REFRESH   had no effect,
  as it was implemented using the incorrect variable name of
  DELEGATE\_JOB\_GSI\_CREDENTIALS\_RENEWAL.
  The implementation now uses the correct name.
  [(Ticket #3282).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3282)
* When using privilege separation, jobs would be put on hold after
  they finished running if the working directory contained links to
  files that were not globally readable.
  [(Ticket #2904).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2904)
* The configuration variable ENABLE\_ADDRESS\_REWRITING
  was not correctly applied to the *condor\_schedd* address when
  claiming a slot.
  The incorrect behavior observed was always as though
  ENABLE\_ADDRESS\_REWRITING was False.
  This could result
  in communication errors for jobs running from multi-homed submit machines.
  [(Ticket #3330).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3330)
* When using *condor\_defrag* or *condor\_drain*, a rare sequence of
  events could result in the *condor\_startd* exiting with the
  following error message:

  ```

  ERROR "match_info() called with unexpected state (Drained)"

  ```
  [(Ticket #3331).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3331)
* The *condor\_gridmanager* no longer crashes when a CREAM grid job
  is submitted with an X.509 proxy that does not have VOMS attributes.
  [(Ticket #3356).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3356)
* *condor\_chirp* fetch could only transfer text files on Windows. It would
  truncate or corrupt binary files.
  [(Ticket #3355).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3355)
* Fixed a bug in the *condor\_gridmanager* that prevented the use
  of grid-type **batch** to submit jobs into an HTCondor pool.
  The *condor\_gridmanager* would attempt to use the wrong GAHP server.
  [(Ticket #3364).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3364)
* The default for the undocumented configuration variable
  X\_RUNS\_HERE   was inverted from True to False
  starting with the release of version 7.7.3.
  Its default has been reset to True.
  When False, the *condor\_master* will not start the *condor\_kbdd*.
  [(Ticket #3343).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3343)
* Fixed a bug in the init script for Red Hat derived Linux systems that
  prevented the Condor service from being stopped during system shutdown.
  [(Ticket #3368).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3368)
* The *condor\_master* would sometimes crash on reconfiguration when the
  High Availability configuration had changed. It no longer crashes.
  [(Ticket #3292).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3292)
* Fixed a bug that caused the *condor\_starter* to crash
  when *condor\_chirp* is used and there is a configuration variable
  setting of USE\_NFS = True or USE\_AFS = True.
  This will happen with parallel universe jobs,
  because the MPI scripts invoke *condor\_chirp*.
  [(Ticket #3361).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3361)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* The manual incorrectly identified configuration variable
  COLLECTOR\_PERSISTENT\_AD\_LOG   as PERSISTENT\_AD\_LOG.
  This has now been corrected throughout the manual.
  [(Ticket #3205).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3205)

## Version 7.8.6

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.8.6 released on October 25, 2012.
* *Security Item*: This version contains an important security bug fix. See below
  for details of this and other bugs fixed.

Bugs Fixed:

* *Security Item*: Fixed a bug which allowed jobs submitted to the standard
  universe to escalate privilege on the submit machine and execute code as root.
  (CVE-2012-5390)

## Version 7.8.5

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.8.5 released on October 22, 2012.

New Features:

* Condor now contains a tool called *accountant\_log\_fixer*,
  that can fix the damage to the file Accountantnew.log
  caused by a bug in the Condor version 7.8.4 *condor\_negotiator*.
  [(Ticket #3221).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3221)

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a problem with jobs that are submitted with
  ```

    noop_job = true

  ```
  These jobs would, in rare cases, cause the *condor\_schedd* daemon to crash.
  [(Ticket #3156).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3156)
* The *condor\_startd* daemon crashed if a job failed to match
  a partitionable slot after the application
  of configuration variables of the MODIFY\_REQUEST\_EXPR\_ category.
  [(Ticket #3260).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3260)
* The *condor\_schedd* daemon would mark scheduler universe jobs
  as completed and remove them from the job queue,
  even when they should have been requeued, according to policy.
  This caused *condor\_dagman* jobs to fail to restart. This bug exists
  in all Condor versions 7.8.0 through 7.8.4.
  Upon upgrading from these Condor versions, users will need to intervene
  in order to restart their *condor\_dagman* jobs. *condor\_dagman* should not
  need such intervention when upgrading from Condor version 7.8.5.
  To restart a *condor\_dagman* job,
  the simplest solution is to issue the command
  ```

    condor_submit <DAGFile>.condor.sub

  ```
  where the original DAG was submitted with
  ```

    condor_submit <DAGFile>

  ```
  [(Ticket #3207).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3207)
* The Condor version 7.8.4 *condor\_negotiator* daemon wrote
  corrupt resource entries to the file Accountantnew.log,
  which it would then not be able to read.
  The Condor version 7.9.0 *condor\_negotiator* daemon will abort
  when trying to read these corrupted resource entries.
  The *condor\_negotiator* will now correct these corrupt
  resource entries over time.
  [(Ticket #3221).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3221)
* Fixed a bug in which the *condor\_schedd* statistics ClassAd attributes
  JobsAccumExecuteTime
  and JobsAccumPostExecuteTime were sometimes much too large for jobs
  that had been vacated and then restarted.
  Note that these currently undocumented attributes would only appear
  in the ClassAd if the verbosity level for *condor\_schedd* statistics
  was set at the high value of 2 by the configuration variable
  STATISTICS\_TO\_PUBLISH.
  [(Ticket #3227).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3227)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.8.4

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.8.4 released on September 19, 2012.
* This release contains several important security fixes and all users should upgrade as soon as possible.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* The new configuration variable GSI\_AUTHZ\_CONF
  fixes a bug in which an instance of Condor may utilize the
  wrong Globus mapping.
  The configuration variable defines a path and file name
  to the file that contains the Globus mapping library.
  See the complete definition at
   [3.3.26](3_3Configuration.html#param:GSIAuthzConf).
  [(Ticket #2103).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2103)

Bugs Fixed:

* *Security Item*: Some code that was no longer used was removed. The presence
  of this code could expose information which would allow an attacker to control
  another user's job. (CVE-2012-3493)
* *Security Item*: Some code that was no longer used was removed. The presence
  of this code could have lead to a Denial-of-Service attack which would allow
  an attacker to remove another user's idle job. (CVE-2012-3491)
* *Security Item*: Filesystem (FS) authentication was improved to check the UNIX
  permissions of the directory used for authentication. Without this, an
  attacker may have been able to impersonate another submitter on the same submit
  machine. (CVE-2012-3492)
* *Security Item*: Although not user-visible, there were multiple updates to
  remove places in the code where potential buffer overruns could occur, thus
  removing potential attacks. None were known to be exploitable.
* *Security Item*: Although not user-visible, there were updates to the code to
  improve error checking of system calls, removing some potential security
  threats. None were known to be exploitable.
* Fixed the *condor\_schedd* daemon;
  it would crash when a submit description file
  contained a malformed `$$()` expansion macro that contained
  a period.
  [(Ticket #3216).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3216)
* Fixed a case in which a daemon could crash and leave behind a log
  file owned by root. This root-owned file would then cause
  subsequent attempts to restart the daemon to fail.
  [(Ticket #2894).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2894)
* Fixed a special case bug in which configuration variables
  defined utilizing initial substrings of $(DOLLAR),
  for example $(D) and $(DO),
  were not expanded properly.
  [(Ticket #3217).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3217)
* The command *condor\_q* **-run** now displays correct HOST field
  information for local universe jobs.
  [(Ticket #3150).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3150)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.8.3

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.8.3 released on September 6, 2012.

New Features:

* The libcondorapi library for reading and writing job event
  logs is again available as a shared library on Linux and Mac OS platforms.
  Since Condor 7.5.x, it had only been available as a static library.
  [(Ticket #3047).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3047)

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* To avoid the output of an unnecessary DAGMan error message,
  the value of DAGMAN\_LOG\_ON\_NFS\_IS\_ERROR
  is ignored when both CREATE\_LOCKS\_ON\_LOCAL\_DISK
  and ENABLE\_USERLOG\_LOCKING are True.
  [(Ticket #3087).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3087)

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a bug in which usage of cgroups incorrectly included the
  page cache in the maximum memory usage.
  This bug fix is also included in Condor version 7.9.0.
  [(Ticket #3003).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3003)
* Jobs from a hook to fetch work,
  where the hook is defined by configuration variable
  <Keyword>\_HOOK\_FETCH\_WORK,
  now correctly receive dynamic slots from a partitionable slot
  instead of claiming the entire partitionable slot.
  [(Ticket #2819).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2819)
* Fixed a bug in which a slot might become stuck in the Preempting state
  when a *condor\_startd* is configured with a hook to fetch work,
  as defined by <Keyword>\_HOOK\_FETCH\_WORK  .
  [(Ticket #3076).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3076)
* Fixed a bug that caused Condor to transfer a job's input files from
  the execute machine back to the submit machine as if they were output files.
  This would happen if the
  job's input files were stored in Condor's spool directory;
  occurred if the job was submitted via Condor-C or via
  *condor\_submit* with the **-spool** or **-remote** options.
  [(Ticket #2406).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2406)
* Fixed a bug that could cause the first grid-type cream jobs destined
  for a particular CREAM server to never be submitted to that server.
  This bug was probably introduced in Condor version 7.6.5.
  [(Ticket #3054).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3054)
* Fixed several problems with the XML parsing class
  ClassAdXMLParser in the ClassAds library:
  + Several methods named ParseClassAd() were declared,
    but never implemented.
    [(Ticket #3049).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3049)
  + The parser silently dropped leading white space in string values.
    [(Ticket #3042).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3042)
  + The parser could go into an infinite loop or leak memory when
    reading a malformed ClassAd XML document.
    [(Ticket #3045).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3045)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the **-f** command line option to
  *condor\_history* from being recognized.
  The **-f** option was being interpreted as **-forward**.
  At least four letters are now required for the **-forward** option
  (**-forw**) to prevent ambiguity.
  [(Ticket #3044).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3044)
* The implementation of the *condor\_history* **-backwards** option,
  which is the default ordering for reading the history file,
  in the 7.7 series did not work on Windows platforms.
  This has been fixed.
  [(Ticket #3055).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3055)
* Fixed a bug that caused an invalid proxy to be delegated when
  refreshing the job's X.509 proxy when configuration variable
  DELEGATE\_JOB\_GSI\_CREDENTIALS\_LIFETIME   was set to 0.
  [(Ticket #3059).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3059)
* Fixed a bug in which DAGMan did not account properly for jobs being
  suspended and then unsuspended.
  [(Ticket #3108).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3108)
* *condor\_dagman* now takes note of job reconnect failed
  events (event code 24) in the user log, for counting idle jobs.
  [(Ticket #3189).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3189)
* Job IDs generated by NorduGrid ARC 12.05 and above are now
  properly recognized.
  [(Ticket #3062).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3062)
* Fixed a bug in which Condor would not mark grid-type nordugrid jobs
  as Running due to variation in the format of the job status value.
  NorduGrid ARC job statuses of the form INLRMS: ? are now
  properly recognized both with and without the space after the colon.
  [(Ticket #3118).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3118)
* The *condor\_gridmanager* now properly handles X.509 proxy files
  that are specified in the job ClassAd with a relative path name.
  [(Ticket #3027).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3027)
* Fixed a bug that caused daemon names,
  as set in configuration variables such as STARTD\_NAME,
  containing a period character to be ignored.
  [(Ticket #3172).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3172)
* Fixed a bug that prevented the *condor\_schedd* from removing old
  execute directories for local universe jobs on start up.
  [(Ticket #3176).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3176)
* The *condor\_defrag* daemon sometimes scheduled fewer draining attempts
  than specified.
  [(Ticket #3199).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3199)
* Fixed a bug that could cause the *condor\_gridmanager* to crash if a
  grid universe job's X.509 user certificate did not contain an e-mail
  address.
  [(Ticket #3203).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3203)
* Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.7.5 that caused multiple
  *condor\_schedd* daemons running on the same machine to share the job queue
  with each other due to way in which the default value of configuration
  variable JOB\_QUEUE\_LOG was set.
  [(Ticket #3196).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3196)
* Fixed a bug that could cause *condor\_q* to not print all jobs when
  it thought it was querying an old *condor\_schedd* daemon.
  [(Ticket #3206).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3206)
* Fixed a bug that could cause a job's standard output and standard
  error files to be written in the job's initial working directory,
  despite the submit description file's specification to write them
  to a different directory.
  This would happen when the file transfer mechanism was used,
  the execution machine was running Condor version 7.7.1 or earlier,
  and either Condor's security negotiation
  was disabled or the configuration variable
  SEC\_ENABLE\_MATCH\_PASSWORD\_AUTHENTICATION was set to True.
  [(Ticket #3208).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3208)
* The log message generated when the EXECUTE directory
  is missing is now more helpful.
  [(Ticket #3194).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3194)
* The load average was incorrect for non-English versions on
  Windows platforms.
  This has been fixed for Windows Vista and more recent versions.
  [(Ticket #3182).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3182)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* There is now documentation for the submit description file commands
  **encrypt\_input\_files**,
  **encrypt\_output\_files**,
  **dont\_encrypt\_input\_files**, and
  **dont\_encrypt\_output\_files** in the *condor\_submit*
  manual page.
  These commands have been available since Condor version 6.7.2,
  but were never documented.
  See descriptions starting at
   [10](condor_submit.html#man-condor-submit-dont-encrypt-input-files).
  [(Ticket #3174).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3174)

* *Security Item*: Fixed a critical problem with DNS handling.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* None.

Bugs Fixed:

* *Security Item*: Fixed a critical problem with DNS handling.

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

## Version 7.8.1

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.8.1 released on June 15, 2012.

New Features:

* None.

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* (Added in 7.8.0.) The new configuration variable
  ENABLE\_DEPRECATION\_WARNINGS   causes *condor\_submit* to issue
  warnings when a job requests features that are no longer supported.
  [(Ticket #2968).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2968)
* (Added in 7.7.6) The new configuration variable
  BATCH\_GAHP   should be used instead of PBS\_GAHP  ,
  LSF\_GAHP   and SGE\_GAHP  . These older configuration
  variables are still recognized, but their use is now discouraged.
  [(Ticket #2670).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2670)
* The default value for GROUP\_SORT\_EXPR   was changed
  so that the <none> group would always negotiate last
  when using hierarchical group quotas.
  Associated with that,
  the default value for NEGOTIATOR\_ALLOW\_QUOTA\_OVERSUBSCRIPTION
  was changed to True.
  These changes were made to make negotiation behave more like it did
  in the stable 7.4 series of Condor,
  before hierarchical group quotas were added.
  [(Ticket #3040).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3040)

Bugs Fixed:

* Fixed a bug that caused events to not be written to the job event
  log when the log is written in XML and a job policy expression triggering
  the event contains any double quote marks.
  [(Ticket #3048).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3048)
* Fixed a bug in the Condor init script that would cause
  the init script to hang if Condor was not running.
  [(Ticket #2872).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2872)
* Fixed a bug that caused parallel universe jobs using
  Parallel Scheduling Groups
  (see section [3.12.8](3_12Setting_Up.html#sec:Configure-Dedicated-Groups))
  to occasionally stay idle even when
  there were available machines to run them.
  [(Ticket #3017).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3017)
* Fixed a bug that caused the *condor\_gridmanager* to crash when
  attempting to submit jobs to a local PBS, LSF, or SGI cluster.
  [(Ticket #3014).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3014)
* Fixed a bug in the handling of local universe jobs which caused
  the *condor\_schedd* to log a spurious ERROR message
  every time a local universe job exited,
  and then further caused the statistics for local universe jobs to be
  incorrectly computed.
  [(Ticket #3008).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3008)
* Changed the internally used *condor\_ckpt\_probe* executable
  to link statically, which should make the
  checkpoint signature more resistant to non-significant changes in the system
  configuration.
  [(Ticket #2901).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2901)
* Restored Globus and VOMS support for the Mac OS X platform.
  [(Ticket #2991).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2991)
* Fixed a bug when Condor runs under the PrivSep model,
  in which if a job created a hard link from one file to another,
  Condor was unable to transfer the files back to the submit side,
  and the job was put on hold.
  [(Ticket #2987).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2987)
* When configuration variables MaxJobRetirementTime or
  MachineMaxVacateTime were very large, estimates of machine
  draining badput and completion time were sometimes nonsensical
  because of integer overflow.
  [(Ticket #3001).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3001)
* Fixed a bug where per-job subdirectories and their contents
  in $(SPOOL) would not be removed when the associated job
  left the queue.
  [(Ticket #2942).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2942)
* Fixed a bug that could cause the *condor\_schedd* to
  occasionally crash due to a race condition when running local universe jobs.
  Associated with the bug would be the error message
  ```

  No local universe jobs were expected to be running, but one just exited!

  ```
  [(Ticket #3009).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=3009)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* Submit description file commands introduced in Condor version 7.7.1
  have now been documented.
  See the *condor\_submit* manual page at [10](condor_submit.html#man-condor-submit) for
  the newly added definitions of
  ****ec2\_availability\_zone****

  ****ec2\_ebs\_volumes****

  ****ec2\_elastic\_ip****

  ****ec2\_keypair\_file****

  ****ec2\_vpc\_ip****

  ****ec2\_vpc\_subnet****
* There is now a manual page for *condor\_router\_rm*,
  a script that provides additional features convenient for removing
  jobs managed by the Condor Job Router.
* Documentation not completed for the 7.7.6 release is now available.
  The use of configuration variable BATCH\_GAHP,
  as well as the use of the new **grid\_resource** of
  type batch for local submission of PBS, LSF, and SGE
  jobs is documented.
  See section [5.3.5](5_3Grid_Universe.html#sec:batch) for details.
  [(Ticket #2670).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2670)

## Version 7.8.0

Release Notes:

* Condor version 7.8.0 released on May 10, 2012.

New Features:

* (Added in 7.7.6.) The new *-\_condor\_relocatable* argument
  may be given as part of the invocation of a program that uses
  standalone checkpointing. This allows checkpointed programs to restart
  without attempting to change to their original directory.
  [(Ticket #2877).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2877)
* (Added in 7.7.5.) Added the *-absent* flag to *condor\_status*,
  which displays absent ClassAds.
  [(Ticket #2690).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2690)
* (Added in 7.7.5.) Implement absent ads, which help track pool membership
  in a persistent way.
  [(Ticket #2608).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2608)

Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

* The job ClassAd attribute RemotePool is now saved in
  LastRemotePool when the job finishes running.

Bugs Fixed:

* (Fixed in 7.7.6.) Fix *-absent*, *-vm*, and *-java*
  flags to *condor\_status* so that they work with the *-long* option.
  [(Ticket #2943).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2943)
* Support glob() on Scientific Linux 6 and others using the new
  Linux system call fstatat(), but only when not using remote system calls.
  [(Ticket #2945).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2945)
* Fixed potential startd crash introduced in v7.7.5 when claiming
  a partitionable slot that was in the Owner state.
  [(Ticket #2936).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2936)
* When ClassAd function stringListMember() is called with an empty
  string as the second argument, it now evaluates to False.
  Previously, it incorrectly evaluated to Undefined.
  [(Ticket #2953).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2953)
* Format tags %v and %V for the **-format** option now properly
  print all ClassAd value types. Previously, True and False
  were printed as integers, and new ClassAd types like lists and nested
  ClassAds could not be printed.
  [(Ticket #2960).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2960)
* Restored RCS keyword strings CondorVersion and CondorPlatform to
  the Condor binaries. These strings are found and printed by the
  **ident** program on Unix. They were missing in Condor versions 7.7.3
  and later.
  [(Ticket #2932).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2932)
* *condor\_job\_router* failed to route spooled source jobs.
  [(Ticket #2955).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2955)
* Fixed a bug on Debian 6 and RHEL 6 that could cause standard
  universe jobs to never checkpoint. This would happen if the job
  triggered a call to NSCD (Name Service Caching Daemon) but NSCD
  wasn't running.
  Calls to NSCD can be triggered by a look up of a user account or
  resolving a machine hostname to an IP address.
  Now, NSCD is never consulted by a standard universe
  job (this was already the behavior on other platforms).
  [(Ticket #2973).](https://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=2973)

Known Bugs:

* None.

Additions and Changes to the Manual:

* None.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=848218#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-14 22:43:08 UTC  ``` Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered that Condor's file system authentication challenge accepted directories with weak permissions (for example, world readable, writable and executable permissions). If a user created a directory with such permissions, a local attacker could rename it, allowing them to execute jobs with the privileges of the victim user.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=848218#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 15:55:43 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=848218#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:45:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:1278 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1278.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=848218#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-09-19 17:53:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1281 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1281.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=848218#c4)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 21:07:07 UTC  ``` Created condor tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 858867](show_bug.cgi?id=858867 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2012-3491 CVE-2012-3492 CVE-2012-3493 condor various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=848218#c5)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-19 21:59:57 UTC  ``` This has been resolved in upstream 7.6.10 and 7.8.4:  <https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/archive/condor-users/2012-September/msg00077.shtml>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=848218#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-09-20 21:46:31 UTC  ``` Upstream git commit:  <http://condor-git.cs.wisc.edu/?p=condor.git;a=commitdiff;h=1db67805>   ``` |  |
