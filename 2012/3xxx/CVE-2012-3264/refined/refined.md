Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2012-3264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) features of HP SiteScope. The specific nature of the vulnerability isn't detailed, but it's related to the way SiteScope handles SOAP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is in the implementation of the SiteScope SOAP API, allowing for potential remote exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Disclosure of Information:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored or managed by SiteScope.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server running SiteScope. This would give them full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote. The vulnerabilities can be exploited over a network.
*   The vulnerability is triggered through SOAP requests. This implies the attacker would need network access to the SiteScope SOAP API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the server running HP SiteScope.
*   **Knowledge of the SOAP API:** The attacker would likely need some understanding of how to send specially crafted SOAP requests to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The document also lists other similar CVEs (CVE-2012-3259 to CVE-2012-3263) affecting HP SiteScope's SOAP features, all with the same CVSS base score of 10.0, indicating a high severity.
*   The fix involves updating to SiteScope v11.13 and disabling the vulnerable SOAP API by adding `_disableOldAPIs=true` in the `master.config` file. It is noted that this is not the default, to ensure backward compatibility. This is a critical step to fully mitigate the risks, but it is not enabled by default.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Andrea Micalizzi aka rgod through the TippingPoint Zero Day Initiative.
*   The affected software is HP SiteScope v11.10 for Windows, Linux, and Solaris.
* The CVSS vector for this CVE is (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) which translate to:
    *   Attack Vector: Network
    *   Attack Complexity: Low
    *   Authentication: None
    *   Confidentiality Impact: Complete
    *   Integrity Impact: Complete
    *   Availability Impact: Complete

This CVSS vector and score of 10.0 (Critical) accurately reflect the potential severity of the vulnerability.
