Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3990:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the IME State Manager implementation within the Mozilla codebase. Specifically, the issue occurs in relation to the `nsIContent::GetNameSpaceID` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to potential crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
-  The vulnerability can cause a denial-of-service via application crash.
-  There's mention of it being potentially exploitable.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through unspecified vectors. This suggests a lack of clarity in the specific steps required to trigger the vulnerability. However, it's implied that interaction via a web browser is necessary, as Javascript execution is essential for triggering it in affected applications.
-  The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker capability to host/deliver malicious content to the victim via a web browser.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into interacting with the malicious content.
-  The user must have Javascript enabled in their browser or be in a browser like context where JS is enabled.
