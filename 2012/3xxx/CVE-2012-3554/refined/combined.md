#### [A great product that I've been using for over 10 years.](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/photos-a-images/galleries/rsgallery2/#rev-103230)

[Gary (1).](/profile/profile/details/288755)

###### Functionality

Has a lot of functions that are normally only seen in a paid for product.

###### Ease of use

Very intuitive and easy to use, I found it was easy to create a complex gallery without having to read a manual.

###### Support

I've never had to use the support function but I have contacted the developer and his response was quick and friendly.

I used this to:
I have over a 1,000 photos on my site and need to organise them in a nested fashion. It does everything I need while trying not to be something it isn't.

Overall was in need of a little TLC but it's been getting a lot of attention from the developer in recent months.

#### [Great product and support](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/photos-a-images/galleries/rsgallery2/#rev-995)

I have used this product for years and it has always worked well for me.

Yesterday was the first time I had to look fgor any support and the response was great.

My issue has been resolved in less than 24 hours.

Well done and many thanks.

Just one of the best components that I've ever used (and I've been using it for years). Entirely recommend it!

#### [My choosen one!](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/photos-a-images/galleries/rsgallery2/#rev-993)

[Eric Lee (1).](/profile/profile/details/191473)

Yes, tried other offerings, wasted time and effort, got lucky with this one. Have been waiting for the 3.2 version to go public to review it as I had issues with the 3.1 version. Shared issues with the development team--supportive beyond belief. New beta versions offered for testing, tested, shared other issues, tested newer versions until I was deliriously happy. Have had no issues since. This is a true open source project and open source at its best. Back-end customization options should be all most could want and more advanced users will find tweaking the code easy peasy should the whim arise. Try this one first.

#### [This is THE Gallery](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/photos-a-images/galleries/rsgallery2/#rev-992)

I was looking for a decent, easy-to-use and nice-looking gallery component, and it's been here all the time! I couldn't help falling in love in a very short time - and that has only kept growing.

A big plus is the ease of customizing the templates even more to fit my needs. With the help from exceptionally responsive support it's been a breeze to have my site exactly the look'n'feel I wanted.

Besides this is truly free with no strings attached - another great plus for a non-profit like myself.

So big thanks to the developer team, keep up the excellent work!

#### [Excellent Gallery that can also be created from frontend](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/photos-a-images/galleries/rsgallery2/#rev-991)

[Michael Kenneally (4).](/profile/profile/details/180011)

Posted on 02 June 2012

I wanted an elegant gallery for Joomla 2.5 that users could create, edit and delete categories and images in frontend and this ticked all the boxes. Permissions can be set so that only particular user groups can edit all images or so that users can only edit their own images. Clean, stylish gallery with slideshow. I tried numerous galleries and this one looked the best and is easy for frontend users.

#### [This component is ridiculous (No offense)](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/photos-a-images/galleries/rsgallery2/#rev-990)

[matheusgrafix (9).](/profile/profile/details/150771)

Posted on 08 May 2012

It took me almost two hours to configure and read the documentation/search the forums to find out how to set the permissions. Now users can create, edit and delete their own categories and images, but they also have the option to see other users galleries inside "My galleries" tab along with the create, edit and delete buttons, even though they can't do anything to the other users galleries. I need something that won't allow them to see other users galleries inside "My galleries" tab. Having your gallery inside another user menu is ridiculous.

It was very tiring to make this work, and now I realize that what I did was a loop, that's why I gave it Very Poor rating. If it were easy to configure, and fully functional, I'd give Excellent rate and would also donate for the project, specially if it supported Community Builder.

I don't want to offend you, I just need you to pay attention at my issue and make this extension become what it means to be, an excellent extension.

#### [Needs improvement](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/photos-a-images/galleries/rsgallery2/#rev-988)

[Colin Dowling (2).](/profile/profile/details/151811)

Posted on 28 March 2012

Great potential, ticks all the boxes apart from one KEY element:

All users have access to add and edit each others images & directories.

Owner's reply:
Thank you for your time to create a review. You say "All users have access to add and edit each others images & directories.". For RSGallery2 3.x this depends on the permissions you give your users. You can indeed set it up so that each user can edit all images and galleries, but you can also set it up that only specific usergroups can edit all images and galleries or that users can edit only their own images and galleries. Permission to edit is implemented in the same way as in Joomla itself (compare it to Edit and Edit Own permissions for editing an article).

If you need help with this, please post on the forum found at www.rsgallery2.nl! If you feel that you've set permissions correctly and that there is a bug, please report it on the forum www.rsgallery2.nl with details, that way all users can benefit from feedback and bugs can be fixed.

wow, what can I say about this Component other than 1 million thank you's. I tried several before this and I wish I had tried yours first, it would of saved a lot of time. Wonderful Component. Works first time on install, no glitches, issues, nothing.

Nothing short of Perfection. Donation on route!

#### [Great gallery!](https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/photos-a-images/galleries/rsgallery2/#rev-986)

This is a great gallery, I have nothing bad to say about it. It took 2 minutes to install and start working on it.. but about an hour to go thru the entire website, find it, downloading and another 45 mins to get the basic steps... the site is just too messy... not very user friendly.... anyways, take it as a constructive criticism please.
