Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3468:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the improper handling of user-supplied data when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the application was directly embedding unsanitized or unescaped user-provided input into SQL queries which allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which exists in multiple parts of the application. This allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through user-controlled inputs like HTTP POST and GET parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data from the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might gain administrative privileges by manipulating the database.
*   **Application compromise:** The attacker may potentially alter application behavior or insert malicious code.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially cause application crashes or DoS through SQL injection

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:**  Specifically, the `alerts/verify` endpoint is vulnerable. The `alert_code`, `alert_mobile` and `alert_email` POST parameters were not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
*    **HTTP GET Requests:** The `json/timeline` endpoint is vulnerable. The `m` GET parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
*  **Admin Panel:** The `admin/messages` endpoint is vulnerable. The `rid` GET parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. No other special capabilities are required.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the described vulnerabilities.

**Specific Code examples and fixes**

*   **alerts/verify**: The code was using string concatenation to build a SQL query with user input:
    ```php
    $filter = "alert.alert_type=1 AND alert_code='".$_POST['alert_code']."' AND alert_recipient='".$_POST['alert_mobile']."' ";
    ```
    The fix implemented was to use the database's escaping method:
     ```php
    $filter = "alert.alert_type=1 AND alert_code='".Database::instance()->escape_str(utf8::strtoupper($_POST['alert_code']))."' AND alert_recipient='".Database::instance()->escape_str($_POST['alert_mobile'])."' ";
    ```
*   **json/timeline:** The code was using direct parameter input:
     ```php
    $query = "SELECT incident\_id AS id FROM ".$this->table_prefix."media "
    . "WHERE media\_type = ".$_GET['m']
    . $incident_id_in;
    ```
    The fix was to use intval():
      ```php
     $query = "SELECT incident_id AS id FROM ".$this->table_prefix."media "
    . "WHERE media_type = ".intval($_GET['m'])
    . $incident_id_in;
    ```
*   **admin/messages:** The code was using direct parameter input:
     ```php
     $filter .= ' AND message.reporter_id=\''.$_GET['rid'].'\'';
    ```
    The fix was to use intval():
        ```php
     $filter .= ' AND message.reporter_id=\''.intval($_GET['rid']).'\'';
    ```

* **settings::save_all()**: The code was using sprintf to build the SQL query:
   ```php
    $keys[] = sprintf("'%s'", $key);
    $values[] = sprintf("WHEN '%s' THEN '%s' ", $key, $value);
   ```
   The fix implemented was to use the database's escaping method:
   ```php
   $keys[] = Database::instance()->escape($key);
   $values[] = sprintf("WHEN %s THEN %s ", Database::instance()->escape($key), Database::instance()->escape($value));
   ```

* **MY_Checkin_Api_Object.php**: The code was using string concatenation to build a SQL query with user input:
    ```php
     $query = 'SELECT id FROM '.$this->table_prefix.'users WHERE `email` = \''.$user_email.'\' LIMIT 1;';
     $usercheck = $this->db->query($query);
    ```
    The fix implemented was to use parameterized query:
    ```php
    $query = 'SELECT id FROM `'.$this->table_prefix.'users` WHERE `email` = ? LIMIT 1;';
    $usercheck = $this->db->query($query, $user_email);
    ```

In summary, the provided content shows multiple instances of SQL injection vulnerabilities due to lack of proper input sanitization and escaping, which were fixed by using database specific escape functions, intval() and parameterized queries.
