Subject: CVE-request: plow buffer overflow vulnerability

Can you assign 2012 CVE-identifier for plow buffer overflow issue reported in here: <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2012/Jul/22>

After discussion with Pereira I checked several versions of the code and affected code is at least in versions 0.0.1, 0.0.2. Sorry but I was unable to find proper version control commits. Version 0.0.1 is still suggested at least in sourceforge page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/plow.berlios/>

I am unable to compile this software in my Debian stable or unstable system so I can't verify these using the PoC.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
