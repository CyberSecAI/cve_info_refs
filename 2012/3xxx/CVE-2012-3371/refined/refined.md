```
1.  **Relates to CVE:** YES
2.  **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the Nova scheduler's affinity filters (DifferentHostFilter and SameHostFilter). These filters were making repeated database calls via `compute_api.get()` for each instance ID provided in the `scheduler_hints`.
3.  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Excessive DB calls:** The filters were making individual database lookups for each instance ID in the `scheduler_hints`, leading to a large number of DB calls when a malicious user provides multiple instance IDs.
    *   **Lack of Input validation:** The scheduler did not limit the number of instance IDs specified in the `scheduler_hints`, which made it vulnerable to attacks that send a large number of IDs.
    *   **Performance Issue:** The large number of DB calls could cause the Nova scheduler to hang while processing requests which contain large numbers of UUID's in the scheduler_hints.
4.  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An authenticated user could exploit this vulnerability by crafting server creation requests with scheduler hints that include a large number of repeated instance IDs.
    *   **Scheduler Hang:** This could result in the Nova scheduler hanging or becoming unresponsive, as it would be overloaded with database lookups.
    *   **Server Outage:** By making multiple malicious requests, an attacker could potentially bring down all the Nova schedulers, leading to a service outage.
5.  **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Malicious `scheduler_hints`:** An attacker would create a server creation request with a specially crafted `os:scheduler_hints` section.
    *   **Repeated Instance IDs:** The malicious request would contain a large number of repeated valid instance IDs in the `same_host` or `different_host` hints.
6.  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account to access the OpenStack API.
    *   **Knowledge of Instance IDs:** The attacker must know at least one valid instance ID in the OpenStack environment.
    *   **Ability to send API requests:** The attacker must be able to send server creation requests to the Nova API.
