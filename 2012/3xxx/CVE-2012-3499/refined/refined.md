CVE-2012-3499: Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.24-dev and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving hostnames and URIs in the (1) mod_imagemap, (2) mod_info, (3) mod_ldap, (4) mod_proxy_ftp, and (5) mod_status modules.
```

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper HTML escaping of hostnames and URIs when generating HTTP response data. This allows attackers to inject malicious code through crafted URLs or hostnames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is XSS, stemming from the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled input (hostnames, URIs) within the following modules:
    *   mod\_imagemap
    *   mod\_info
    *   mod\_ldap
    *   mod\_proxy\_ftp
    *   mod\_status

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Web Script Injection:** A remote attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This injected code executes within the context of the victim's browser when they access pages using the vulnerable modules, potentially leading to:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies or tokens.
    *   **Redirection:** Redirecting victims to malicious websites.
    *   **Data theft:** Extracting sensitive user data.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Infecting users with malware through drive-by downloads.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of a website.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The primary attack vector involves crafting HTTP requests that include malicious code within the Host header or URIs. The vulnerable modules then process this crafted input without escaping, leading to the execution of the malicious code in a user's browser.
-   **Man-in-the-Middle:** While not explicitly stated, an attacker performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack could also inject malicious hostnames in transit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, as they are injecting code via crafted HTTP requests.
-   **No authentication required:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without authentication.
-   **User interaction:** The victim must visit a page that uses the affected modules.
-  **Knowledge of the target site configuration:** Knowledge of the target site configurations is needed to target specific vulnerable modules.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The Red Hat bugzilla entry for this CVE provides links to the code diffs, which details the exact lines of code that were changed to resolve this issue
-   The Red Hat Errata also provides a detailed overview of the vulnerable components and how to address the issue with patches.
- The httpd.apache.org vulnerability page for 2.2 and 2.4 contain a summary of this issue and links to affected versions.
- Some of the provided content contains information about other vulnerabilities, which are unrelated to CVE-2012-3499 and were therefore not included in the above response.
- The Red Hat advisory RHSA-2013:0815 addresses this CVE, as well as CVE-2012-4558 and CVE-2013-1862. RHSA-2013:1207, RHSA-2013:1208, and RHSA-2013:1209 also addresses this CVE, as well as CVE-2012-4558, CVE-2013-1896, CVE-2013-1921, CVE-2013-4112, and CVE-2013-2172.
-   The fix involves proper escaping of hostnames and URIs before outputting them in HTML, preventing the browser from interpreting them as code.
