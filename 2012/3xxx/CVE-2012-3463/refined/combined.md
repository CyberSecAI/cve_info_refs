| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=847196#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-08-10 04:59:40 UTC  ``` The ruby on Rails project reports:  There is a vulnerability in Ruby on Rails in the select_tag helper method when a "prompt" is supplied. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2012-3463](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3463).  Versions Affected:  3.x. Not affected:       2.3.x Fixed Versions:     3.2.8, 3.1.8, 3.0.17  Impact - ------ When a "prompt" value is supplied to the `select_tag` helper, the "prompt" value is not escaped.  If untrusted data is not escaped, and is supplied as the prompt value, there is a potential for XSS attacks.  Vulnerable code will look something like this:      select_tag("name", options, :prompt => UNTRUSTED_INPUT)  All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.  Releases - -------- The 3.2.8, 3.1.8, and 3.0.17 releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds - -----------  A possible workaround for this vulnerability is to escape user input supplied to the prompt key:      select_tag("name", options, :prompt => h(UNTRUSTED_INPUT))   Patches - ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-0-select_tag_prompt.patch - Patch for 3.0 series * 3-1-select_tag_prompt.patch - Patch for 3.1 series * 3-2-select_tag_prompt.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.

method when a "prompt" is supplied. This vulnerability has been assigned

the CVE identifier CVE-2012-3463.

Versions Affected: 3.x.

Not affected: 2.3.x

Fixed Versions: 3.2.8, 3.1.8, 3.0.17

Impact

------

When a "prompt" value is supplied to the `select\_tag` helper, the

"prompt" value is not escaped. If untrusted data is not escaped, and is

supplied as the prompt value, there is a potential for XSS attacks.

Vulnerable code will look something like this:

 select\_tag("name", options, :prompt => UNTRUSTED\_INPUT)

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one

of the work arounds immediately.

Releases

--------

The 3.2.8, 3.1.8, and 3.0.17 releases are available at the normal

locations.

Workarounds

-----------

A possible workaround for this vulnerability is to escape user input

supplied to the prompt key:

 select\_tag("name", options, :prompt => h(UNTRUSTED\_INPUT))

Patches

-------

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided

patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format

and consist of a single changeset.

\* 3-0-select\_tag\_prompt.patch - Patch for 3.0 series

\* 3-1-select\_tag\_prompt.patch - Patch for 3.1 series

\* 3-2-select\_tag\_prompt.patch - Patch for 3.2 series

Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at

present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade

as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of

security fixes for unsupported releases.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=847199#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-08-10 05:11:37 UTC  ``` The Ruby on Rails project reports:  There is a vulnerability in the HTML escaping code in Ruby on Rails. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2012-3464](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3464).  Versions Affected:  All. Not affected:       None Fixed Versions:     3.2.8, 3.1.8, 3.0.17  Impact - ------ The HTML escaping code in Ruby on Rails does not escape all potentially dangerous characters.  In particular the code does not escape the single quote character.  The helpers used in Rails itself never use single quotes, so most applications are unlikely to be vulnerable, however all users running an affected release should still upgrade.  Releases - -------- The 3.2.8 and 3.1.8 releases are available at the normal locations.  Workarounds - -----------  For users on earlier releases or who are unable to upgrade, you can install the attached file into config/initializers.  This will upgrade the rails helper to use the Rack::Utils.escape_html helper which does escape the single quote character.  However the Rack helper also escapes the '/' character, this is likely to cause test failures if your application is expecting the values of URLs to be unencoded. These tests however browsers will correctly decode the values and function as expected.  Patches - ------- To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.  * 3-0-escape_html.patch - Patch for 3.0 series * 3-1-escape_html.patch - Patch for 3.1 series * 3-2-escape_html.patch - Patch for 3.2 series  Please note that only the 3.1.x and 3.2.x series are supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.

## Synopsis

Critical: Ruby on Rails security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0154)

## Topic

Updated rubygem-actionpack, rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord
packages that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat
Subscription Asset Manager.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ruby on Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework for web
application development. Action Pack implements the controller and the view
components. Active Record implements object-relational mapping for
accessing database entries using objects. Active Support provides support
and utility classes used by the Ruby on Rails framework.

Multiple flaws were found in the way Ruby on Rails performed XML parameter
parsing in HTTP requests. A remote attacker could use these flaws to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a Ruby on Rails application,
perform SQL injection attacks, or bypass the authentication using a
specially-created HTTP request. (CVE-2013-0156)

Red Hat is aware that a public exploit for the CVE-2013-0156 issues is
available that allows remote code execution in applications using Ruby on
Rails.

Multiple input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in
rubygem-activerecord. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to
perform an SQL injection attack against an application using
rubygem-activerecord. (CVE-2012-2661, CVE-2012-2695, CVE-2012-6496,
CVE-2013-0155)

Multiple input validation vulnerabilities were discovered in
rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to
perform an SQL injection attack against an application using
rubygem-actionpack and rubygem-activerecord. (CVE-2012-2660, CVE-2012-2694)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in rubygem-actionpack.
A remote attacker could use these flaws to conduct XSS attacks against
users of an application using rubygem-actionpack. (CVE-2012-3463,
CVE-2012-3464, CVE-2012-3465)

A flaw was found in the HTTP digest authentication implementation in
rubygem-actionpack. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
denial of service of an application using rubygem-actionpack and digest
authentication. (CVE-2012-3424)

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated rubygem-actionpack,
rubygem-activesupport, and rubygem-activerecord packages, which resolve
these issues. Katello must be restarted ("service katello restart") for
this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>
