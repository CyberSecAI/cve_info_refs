Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2012-3473 is missing authentication on certain API calls related to reports and comments. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authorization checks before performing actions related to comments (such as marking them as spam, pending, or performing other actions). Additionally, the report submission API was also accessible even when reports were disabled via web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of mandatory authentication checks for certain API endpoints. This allows unauthorized users to potentially perform administrative actions on comments, as well as to submit reports when disabled via the web interface, if they are familiar with API.
*   **Inconsistent enforcement of settings:** Report submission was allowed via API even when disabled via web interface

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Comment Management:** An attacker could potentially manipulate comments by marking them as spam or pending without proper authorization. This could lead to censorship or disruption of community discussions
*   **Bypassing intended restrictions:** Attackers can submit reports even when disabled via web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Manipulation:** An attacker could directly access the vulnerable API endpoints without being properly authenticated or authorized.
*   **API calls through web interface:** An attacker can use the web interface to create API calls for report submissions when disabled via web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Ushahidi instance and be able to make API requests.
*  **Understanding of API:** The attacker needs to understand the API structure to construct and send malicious requests.
*   No special privileges or authentication is needed to exploit the missing authentication.
*   To bypass the intended settings, attacker needs to be aware of the API.

**Additional Details:**

The provided content includes multiple commits related to fixing this and related vulnerabilities. Notably:

*   Commit `13ca6f4` addresses the issue where the Report API was accessible even when disabled via the web interface. It also fixes some related PHP errors when missing person params from API request.
*   Commit `f67f4ad` enforces authentication on comment actions and when listing pending, unapproved or spam comments.
*   Commit `529f353` hides sensitive user details from the comments API, which is a related issue but is addressed by CVE-2012-3474.

The content from `openwall.com` confirms that CVE-2012-3473 is specifically assigned to the missing authentication issues fixed by commits `f67f4ad` and `13ca6f4`.
