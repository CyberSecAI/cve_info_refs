  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2012-3737",
      "root_cause": "A design issue existed in the support for viewing photos that were taken at the lock screen. In order to determine which photos to permit access to, the passcode lock consulted the time at which the device was locked and compared it to the time that a photo was taken. By spoofing the current time, an attacker could gain access to photos that were taken before the device was locked.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect time-based access control to photos taken at the lock screen"
      ],
      "impact": "All photos may be accessible at the lock screen",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Physical access to the device",
        "Spoofing the current time"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": [
        "Physical access to the device",
        "Ability to manipulate the device's time"
