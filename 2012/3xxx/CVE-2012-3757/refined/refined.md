### CVE-2012-3757

**Root Cause:** A memory corruption issue exists in the handling of PICT files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of PICT files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution
- An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.
- The attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a maliciously crafted PICT file. This can be achieved through:
  - Email attachment that the user is tricked into opening.
  - Website hosting a specially crafted file that the user is tricked into visiting and opening.
  - Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content that contain malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious PICT file. This can be done through social engineering (e.g., email links, instant messaging links).
- The attacker could also host the file on a website the user is tricked into visiting.
