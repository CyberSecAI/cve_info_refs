Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3485:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of path names in the `openvpnstart` setuid helper application within Tunnelblick. Specifically, the application uses the program's path (`argv[0]`) to construct paths for executing scripts and loading kernel modules without properly sanitizing or validating this input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Arbitrary Kernel Module Loading:** The application constructs the path to load kernel extensions based on `argv[0]`, which is attacker-controlled, and then executes `/sbin/kextload` with the crafted path. This allows an attacker to load arbitrary kernel modules.

2.  **Arbitrary Script Execution:** The application constructs the path to `openvpn` by prepending the directory of `argv[0]` and then executes the crafted path as root. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell scripts as root by controlling `argv[0]`.

3.  **Insufficient Path Validation for File Deletion:** The `errorExitIfAttackViaString` function, which is used when deleting log files, only checks for the presence of `.` prefixes and `/..` substrings. It does not check for symbolic or hard links, allowing an attacker to delete arbitrary files as root by manipulating the path provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Root Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain root privileges by loading arbitrary kernel modules or executing arbitrary shell scripts.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can delete arbitrary files as root, leading to system instability or data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

The primary attack vector involves manipulating the program's path by controlling `argv[0]`. This can be achieved by:
* Creating a symlink with a malicious path
* Renaming the executable or symlink prior to exploitation
*  Using a malicious script in a user controlled directory and executing it via the symlink

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system where Tunnelblick is installed.
*   **Ability to create files:** The attacker needs the ability to create files and directories in a location like `/tmp`.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Shell Scripting:** An attacker would need to write a malicious shell script for the privilege escalation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit detailed in the Metasploit module leverages the arbitrary script execution vulnerability to achieve root access. It creates a directory, a malicious shell script, a symlink to the `openvpnstart` binary with a malicious path and then executes the symlink.
*   The provided `pwnnel-blicker-for-kids.sh` script demonstrates a simple exploit for the vulnerability, showing how to create the necessary files and symlink to trigger arbitrary script execution as root.

The vulnerability is present because the application does not properly validate paths before using them to execute scripts, load modules or delete files.
