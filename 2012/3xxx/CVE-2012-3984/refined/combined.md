How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux x86\_64; U; en) Presto/2.6.30 Version/10.60
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86\_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100423 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.3
Firefox shows the dropdown menu for <select> elements as an always-on-top chromeless window. It also allows arbitrary HTML content to be rendered in the <option> elements within the <select>.
Navigating away from a page with an active <select> menu does not remove the chromeless window containing the menu from view. By opening another menu programatically (using XUL, in my proof-of-concept page), it is possible to make the <select> menu persist through mouse interactions with the browser. By using absolute positioning/scrolling, an attacker can essentially cover arbitrary portions of a user's display with whatever they want.
I think the correct fix here would probably be to automatically dismiss <select> menus when navigating away from pages.
Reproducible: Always

The select is always-on-top too. For example, it could cover the contents of a warning dialog for installing an XPI (and instead make it say something like "Click OK to update Firefox security updates")

(Sorry about the delay. There was the Summit and then I was on vacation.)
Roc, I think the patch isn't enough (it is needed, but just not enough).
Should we close the <select> when the page is scrolled?
What would be the best or easiest way to do that?
Or could we disallow moving the native widget which is showing the popup?

Another defense-in-depth idea...have you considered blocking HTML content in <select> elements? All other browsers only show plain text in <select>, and Firefox already converts to plaintext in some situations (such as setting <select>.innerHTML).

select.innerHTML isn't handled in any special way.
IMO allowing html content <option> elements is quite handy.

Remember that the dropdown is an always-on-top window. The attacker could window.open a new browser window that is positioned lower, so that the evil <select> dropdown from the original window would overlap the address bar of the new window.

True.
We can mitigate this by hiding the dropdown more aggressively, but I think probably it would be better to not render arbitrary HTML in <selects>s. The HTML5 parser is already ignoring most content in <select>: <http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/tokenization.html#parsing-main-inselect>
One way to do this would be to modify nsListControlFrame::BuildDisplayList to throw away any display items that aren't text.

You'd still be able to use generated content, but any non-text content wouldn't be rendered.
Hmm, maybe that still leaves us vulnerable to someone cobbling together glyphs with various colors, using table layout say, to produce an arbitrary display. We can put "color:inherit !important" in the UA style sheet to lock the text color.
Perhaps a more robust option is to modify the frame constructor to only allow inline and text frames inside a dropdown.

An attacker could still use a custom font too, right?

Locking the color would be helpful, as it would make it more difficult to spoof HTTPS convincingly.

Yes. It would be easy to lock the font using a !important rule, though.

I was considering this anyway, since other browsers seem to do something like this. Would need some testing to determine what's actually interoperable now....

I just figured out how to make it not disappear after clicking in Chrome. I'll take care of filing a bug for that.

Behaviors seen in Opera, and possibly IE/Safari: Possible to cover address bar with a <select> dropdown. The dropdown disappears when the user clicks outside of it, so it's pretty hard to use this in an actual spoofing attack. Fixing this would be a defense-in-depth measure.
Behaviors seen in Firefox, Chrome: Possible to cover address bar with a <select> dropdown, \*and\* make the dropdown stay open when the user clicks outside of it. This could potentially be used for an actual spoofing attack.
The proof of concept attached to this bug doesn't work in Chrome...the technique for making the dropdown menu persist in Chrome is completely different than the one used in Firefox.

Don't know about IE/Safari, but in Opera if user uses only keyboard, web page
can capture key events when popup is open. So it may look like
user it typing for example username and password for some service, although
the page is something quite different.

...and never move the visible popup.
This is very much not my area of code, but it has been quite useful and even fun
to learn new things. But anyway, before I write more code, better to ask some
feedback.
Note, we do already close the popup when window moves, so no need to add
code for that.
And the extra layout flush is just moved to be in a useful place.
I don't know if we could somehow get rid of the flush.
I had another approach where I basically disabled images inside <select> (using css), but
that isn't enough.

I get the feeling this is more complex than necessary. When we flip the combobox dropdown vertically, can't we just check whether there's enough space below the top of the toplevel content window and not flip if there isn't enough space? I don't understand the need for mPreviousRootY and mAvailHeight.

But what if the popup is reflowed for larger height? It would be possible to
have too large popup where part of the scrollbar would be below the bottom
of the screen.
I'm trying to keep the default 20 rows height, when possible,
and decrease it only when really needed.
> I don't understand the need for mPreviousRootY and mAvailHeight.
mPreviousRootY is the location of the topmost content window when
popup was activated (but before the flush, so the "previous". Better name could be mRootYWhenPopupActivated).
mAvailHeight tells to the popup what is the maximum height it can use.
> A separate patch for doing CloseOpenPopup in PageHide would be good.
That is rather trivial part of the patch, but I can do a separate patch.

I still don't really follow.
Suppose we modify AbsolutelyPositionDropDown to ensure that the combobox is either a) completely above the window top or b) completely below the toplevel content window top.
Suppose we ensure that once opened, the dropdown widget cannot change its height or position.
You say that we already ensure moving the browser window will close the dropdown.
If we do all of those things, then the problem is fixed, right? And none of those things require extra fields in the frames.

Why can't we just have nsComboboxControlFrame::AllowPositionChange return false for all dropped-down views?
In fact, why can't it just return false always? In that case we'd only need a flag, not a callback.

So if popup is open and <select> is scrolled too much up (so that it isn't
visible), the popup is closed.
If, however the <select> is still visible but the popup overlaps chrome,
the popup is repositioned using AbsolutelyPositionDropDown().
Event handling seem to work ok that way.

This return value is in app units of a different document, so could have a different scale. It probably doesn't matter but you should probably convert the result using NSCoordScale(result, shell->PresContext()->AppUnitsPerDevPixel(), PresContext()->AppUnitsPerDevPixel()).

Calling AbsolutelyPositionDropDown() during DoResetWidgetBounds does not seem safe. But I'd still like to find a way to avoid the viewpositionobserver altogether. We could add a method nsIViewObserver::DidChangeFloatingViewPosition(nsIView\*) which gets called on floating views (nsIView::GetFloating()), and have that method dispatch an event to asynchronously reflow the <select> to reposition the dropdown. Couldn't we?
Why keep mMinPopupY? Can't we just call RootY when we need it?

You don't need to dispatch an nsGUIEvent. You'd just call through mObserver directly.

If you add the check in AbsolutelyPositionDropDown, then AllowPositionChange can call AbsolutelyPositionDropDown unconditionally and always return true, can't it? Then we don't need a return value at all.

Attached patch

[v7](attachment.cgi?id=505477&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=505477&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=575294&attachment=505477)

This is very close to v6. AllowPositionChange does still return PRBool, since
if the widget is moved, that causes some painting artifacts.
I don't know what else I could do here to make this work reasonable well.
Someone more familiar with views and layout could perhaps come up with simpler approach.
In E10s we can make the popup to stay in the content process or something.

The Chromium bug for this issue has been marked as non-security. (Mitigating factors: there is a lot of user-interaction required on Chromium, and it's not a complete spoof, since it is not possible to inject arbitrary images into the <select> dropdown)

I think this bug is more critical than high.
we can use <select> element for make a clickjacking attack, on a Java applet.

There's a lot of spoofing you can do with a chromeless always-on-top rect filled with attacker controlled content.

I wish that Mozilla could fix the low-hanging fruit here (forcing <select> content to be plaintext) more quickly. That would go a long way. You can probably still do some spoofing using a custom web font, but it would be much more limited and would look a little less convincing.

There's a couple of issues to fix here (independently of [bug 726264](/show_bug.cgi?id=726264 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2012-3984) Firefox 10.0.1 : Navigation away from a page with multiple active <select> dropdown menu can be used for Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and geolocalisation")).
The root of the problem is that the content doesn't get a blur event
when a new window is opened (the combobox closes the dropdown on blur).
Also, there's the problem of positioning the dropdown over chrome UI.

Don't allow the dropdown to be above the top of the root frame.
If it's placed below the combobox button, then auto-close it (async).
If it would be clipped by bottom of the screen, then only place it above
the combobox button if it's below the top of the root - otherwise just
leave it below and let it be clipped.
And, copied from your earlier patches:
- if (eventStates.HasState(NS\_EVENT\_STATE\_DISABLED)) {
+ if (aDoDropDown && eventStates.HasState(NS\_EVENT\_STATE\_DISABLED)) {
return;
I think this is right, we don't want to prevent \*closing\* the
dropdown menu just because the element is now disabled. (r=me)

So what if the dropdown is huge, and <select> is somewhere bottom of the page?

OK, I'll drop the second line.
> So what if the dropdown is huge, and <select> is somewhere bottom of the page?
The same requirement applies - the drop-down isn't allowed to protrude above
the top of the page, if it does, then it's displayed downward as normal
(and will be clipped by the screen edge). Are you worried about spoofing
something below the viewport in the status bar or outside the window?

I'm worried that the drop down is really really tiny.

I don't understand, this method doesn't change the size of the dropdown,
it just changes its position. Can you elaborate please?

If the select is right at the bottom of the page, and it has lots of <options> and the window
size is reasonable small. Is there anything which guarantees that something is shown to the user?
Make the window height to be just 100px or so, and load
<http://tinyurl.com/bnlurrf>
What happens to the popup? Right now part of it ends up covering the chrome.

OK, this patch schedules an async resize reflow in these cases:
1. if the space is too small and the dropdown can shrink (ie, it currently
displays 2 or more rows),
2. if the available space is now larger and the dropdown can grow (ie, it
was clipped by the last reflow and it currently displays less than
the maximum rows (20)).

I wonder if scriptrunner could work here. Truly async may cause some flickering, I think.
But, I'm not sure if we have scriptblocker on stack at this point.

I found that positioning/sizing the dropdown from DidReflow gave the wrong
results since the frame isn't positioned at that point, it may be what
caused the flicker you saw. I changed it to use a post-reflow callback
instead. I'll ask roc for a review of parts 3 and 4 too.

This is similar to your idea of a View position observer. To fix spoofing
I think it's enough to track the one and only dropped down menu so I'm
adding a method in nsIRollupListener for that.

Shouldn't you delete nsResizeDropdownAtFinalPosition object also in ReflowFinished?

So who owns the object and when is it deleted?
It is refcounted in some cases, when used as runnable, but not when used as reflowcallback?

Please add some ctor/dtor counters (whatever the macro names are) so that
possible leak can be detected easily.
Also, manual delete should be removed and ADDREF\_THIS and RELEASE\_THIS
should be used instead.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=627572&action=edit)

> Shouldn't you delete nsResizeDropdownAtFinalPosition object also in ReflowFinished?
Oops, good catch. I've incorporated your feedback regarding ownership,
so nsResizeDropdownAtFinalPosition is a always ref-counted now. When
used as a reflow callback I'm doing a forget() after successfully adding
it to the queue, that's later Released when we get the ReflowFinished /
ReflowCallbackCanceled callback (it's guaranteed one will be called).

Fortunately there's nothing wrong with the patches here - the mochitest failure
([bug 759243](/show_bug.cgi?id=759243 "RESOLVED FIXED - Permanent, but intermittent counted as failure test_hiddenitems.xul | blur 10,slider - got [object XULElement], expected [object HTMLInputElement]")) was just a broken test that depended on the bug that part 1 fixes.

Yes, I'm working on a fix for the regression. The problem was that
for a dropdown with <option>s of different heights setting the
computed height to 'mNumDisplayRows \* heightOfARow' is too small.
This is happens for example in the review flags in Bugzilla.
I filed [bug 767374](/show_bug.cgi?id=767374 "NEW - empty <option> has less height than one with text") for that, but it can happen also when that
bug is fixed when the <option>s have different height for
other [valid] reasons.

Use the exact height when the dropdown fits in the available height.
mNumDisplayRows \* heightOfARow is only approximation we use when
clamping the number of items we can show.
Tested on Linux/Win7/OSX.

I don't think we should take this on esr-10/beta, the regression risk is quite
high and I would rate this bug as sec-high, not sec-critical.

Like demonstated in [bug691014](/show_bug.cgi?id=691014 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Firefox 3.6.X : Navigation away from a page with multiple active <select> dropdown menu can be used for Spoofing And ClickJacking with Java applet") and [bug726264](/show_bug.cgi?id=726264 "RESOLVED FIXED - (CVE-2012-3984) Firefox 10.0.1 : Navigation away from a page with multiple active <select> dropdown menu can be used for Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and geolocalisation") this vulnerability is critical.
not high , it's a critical vulnerability.

Given the risk here, we're going to land in 16 first for mainline, and 17 first for ESR.

## Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others

discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an

attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within

the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3982](/security/CVE-2012-3982), [CVE-2012-3983](/security/CVE-2012-3983), [CVE-2012-3988](/security/CVE-2012-3988), [CVE-2012-3989](/security/CVE-2012-3989),

[CVE-2012-4191](/security/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always

properly handle the  element. If a user were tricked into opening a

malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks.

([CVE-2012-3984](/security/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the

HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks

via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](/security/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform

security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](/security/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be

bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could

exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-3991](/security/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user

were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a

remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject

script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](/security/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that

allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote

attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential

data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-3993](/security/CVE-2012-3993), [CVE-2012-3994](/security/CVE-2012-3994), [CVE-2012-4184](/security/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in

Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked

into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker

could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context

of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2012-3990](/security/CVE-2012-3990), [CVE-2012-3995](/security/CVE-2012-3995), [CVE-2012-4179](/security/CVE-2012-4179), [CVE-2012-4180](/security/CVE-2012-4180),

[CVE-2012-4181](/security/CVE-2012-4181), [CVE-2012-4182](/security/CVE-2012-4182), [CVE-2012-4183](/security/CVE-2012-4183), [CVE-2012-4185](/security/CVE-2012-4185), [CVE-2012-4186](/security/CVE-2012-4186),

[CVE-2012-4187](/security/CVE-2012-4187), [CVE-2012-4188](/security/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location

object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information.

Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability

to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2012-4192](/security/CVE-2012-4192), [CVE-2012-4193](/security/CVE-2012-4193))

An update that fixes 27 vulnerabilities is now available.
It includes two new package versions.
Description:
MozillaFirefox was updated to the 10.0.9ESR security
release which fixes bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2012-73 / CVE-2012-3977: Security researchers
Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo reported that SPDY's request
header compression leads to information leakage, which can
allow the extraction of private data such as session
cookies, even over an encrypted SSL connection. (This does
not affect Firefox 10 as it does not feature the SPDY
extension. It was silently fixed for Firefox 15.)
\*
MFSA 2012-74: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
\*
CVE-2012-3983: Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman and
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported memory safety problems and crashes
that affect Firefox 15.
\*
CVE-2012-3982: Christian Holler and Jesse Ruderman
reported memory safety problems and crashes that affect
Firefox ESR 10 and Firefox 15.
\*
MFSA 2012-75 / CVE-2012-3984: Security researcher
David Bloom of Cue discovered that "select" elements are
always-on-top chromeless windows and that navigation away
from a page with an active "select" menu does not remove
this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on
a new page, the original "select" menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an
attacker to cover arbitrary portions of the new page
through absolute positioning/scrolling, leading to spoofing
attacks. Security researcher Jordi Chancel found a
variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was
well.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.

dropdown menu can be used for URL spoofing, other evil
Firefox 10.0.1 : Navigation away from a page with
multiple active "select" dropdown menu can be used for
Spoofing And ClickJacking with XPI using window.open and
geolocalisation
\*
MFSA 2012-76 / CVE-2012-3985: Security researcher
Collin Jackson reported a violation of the HTML5
specifications for document.domain behavior. Specified
behavior requires pages to only have access to windows in a
new document.domain but the observed violation allowed
pages to retain access to windows from the page's initial
origin in addition to the new document.domain. This could
potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
\*
MFSA 2012-77 / CVE-2012-3986: Mozilla developer
Johnny Stenback discovered that several methods of a
feature used for testing (DOMWindowUtils) are not protected
by existing security checks, allowing these methods to be
called through script by web pages. This was addressed by
adding the existing security checks to these methods.
\*
MFSA 2012-78 / CVE-2012-3987: Security researcher
Warren He reported that when a page is transitioned into
Reader Mode in Firefox for Android, the resulting page has
chrome privileges and its content is not thoroughly
sanitized. A successful attack requires user enabling of
reader mode for a malicious page, which could then perform
an attack similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) to gain the
privileges allowed to Firefox on an Android device. This
has been fixed by changing the Reader Mode page into an
unprivileged page.
This vulnerability only affects Firefox for Android.
\*
MFSA 2012-79 / CVE-2012-3988: Security researcher
Soroush Dalili reported that a combination of invoking full
screen mode and navigating backwards in history could, in
some circumstances, cause a hang or crash due to a timing
dependent use-after-free pointer reference. This crash may
be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2012-80 / CVE-2012-3989: Mozilla community
member Ms2ger reported a crash due to an invalid cast when
using the instanceof operator on certain types of
JavaScript objects. This can lead to a potentially
exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-81 / CVE-2012-3991: Mozilla community
member Alice White reported that when the GetProperty
function is invoked through JSAPI, security checking can be
bypassed when getting cross-origin properties. This
potentially allowed for arbitrary code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-82 / CVE-2012-3994: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported that the location property can be
accessed by binary plugins through top.location and top can
be shadowed by Object.defineProperty as well. This can
allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
through plugins.
\*
MFSA 2012-83: Security researcher Mariusz Mlynski
reported that when InstallTrigger fails, it throws an error
wrapped in a Chrome Object Wrapper (COW) that fails to
specify exposed properties. These can then be added to the
resulting object by an attacker, allowing access to chrome
privileged functions through script.
While investigating this issue, Mozilla security
researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 found that COW did not disallow
accessing of properties from a standard prototype in some
situations, even when the original issue had been fixed.
These issues could allow for a cross-site scripting
(XSS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-3993: XrayWrapper pollution via unsafe COW
\*
CVE-2012-4184: ChromeObjectWrapper is not implemented
as intended
\*
MFSA 2012-84 / CVE-2012-3992: Security researcher
Mariusz Mlynski reported an issue with spoofing of the
location property. In this issue, writes to location.hash
can be used in concert with scripted history navigation to
cause a specific website to be loaded into the history
object. The baseURI can then be changed to this stored
site, allowing an attacker to inject a script or intercept
posted data posted to a location specified with a relative
path.
\*
MFSA 2012-85: Security researcher Abhishek Arya
(Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team discovered a
series of use-after-free, buffer overflow, and out of
bounds read issues using the Address Sanitizer tool in
shipped software. These issues are potentially exploitable,
allowing for remote code execution. We would also like to
thank Abhishek for reporting two additional use-after-free
flaws introduced during Firefox 16 development and fixed
before general release.
\*
CVE-2012-3995: Out of bounds read in
IsCSSWordSpacingSpace
\*
CVE-2012-4179: Heap-use-after-free in
nsHTMLCSSUtils::CreateCSSPropertyTxn
\*
CVE-2012-4180: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsHTMLEditor::IsPrevCharInNodeWhitespace
\*
CVE-2012-4181: Heap-use-after-free in
nsSMILAnimationController::DoSample
\*
CVE-2012-4182: Heap-use-after-free in
nsTextEditRules::WillInsert
\*
CVE-2012-4183: Heap-use-after-free in
DOMSVGTests::GetRequiredFeatures
\*
MFSA 2012-86: Security researcher Atte Kettunen from
OUSPG reported several heap memory corruption issues found
using the Address Sanitizer tool. These issues are
potentially exploitable, allowing for remote code execution.
\*
CVE-2012-4185: Global-buffer-overflow in
nsCharTraits::length
\*
CVE-2012-4186: Heap-buffer-overflow in
nsWaveReader::DecodeAudioData
\*
CVE-2012-4187: Crash with ASSERTION: insPos too small
\*
CVE-2012-4188: Heap-buffer-overflow in Convolve3x3
\*
MFSA 2012-87 / CVE-2012-3990: Security researcher
miaubiz used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free in the IME State Manager code. This could
lead to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2012-89 / CVE-2012-4192 / CVE-2012-4193: Mozilla
security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a regression
where security wrappers are unwrapped without doing a
security check in defaultValue(). This can allow for
improper access access to the Location object. In versions
15 and earlier of affected products, there was also the
potential for arbitrary code execution.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-75

## select element persistance allows for attacks

Announced
October 9, 2012
Reporter
David Bloom
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 16
* SeaMonkey 2.13
* Thunderbird 16

### Description

Security researcher **David Bloom** of Cue discovered that
`<select>` elements are always-on-top chromeless windows and
that navigation away from a page with an active `<select>` menu
does not remove this window.When another menu is opened programmatically on a
new page, the original `<select>` menu can be retained and
arbitrary HTML content within it rendered, allowing an attacker to cover
arbitrary portions of the new page through absolute positioning/scrolling,
leading to spoofing attacks. Security researcher **Jordi Chancel**
found a variation that would allow for click-jacking attacks was well.

In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is disabled, but are
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
