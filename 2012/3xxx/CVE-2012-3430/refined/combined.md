# USN-1579-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

21 September 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers

that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit

this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](/security/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel

implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially

use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel.

([CVE-2012-3430](/security/CVE-2012-3430))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP

device driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine part of the

kernel's stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6547](/security/CVE-2012-6547))

A flaw was discovered in the requeuing of futexes in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact. ([CVE-2012-6647](/security/CVE-2012-6647))

A flaw was found in Linux kernel's validation of CIPSO (Common IP Security

Option) options set from userspace. A local user that can set a socket's

CIPSO options could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash

the system). ([CVE-2013-0310](/security/CVE-2013-0310))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-31-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-31.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-31.50)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-31-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-31.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-31.50)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-31.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-31.50)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-31-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-31.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-31.50)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-31-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-31.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-31.50)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-31.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-31.50)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-31-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-31.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-31.50)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

rds: set correct msg\_namelen

```
Jay Fenlason (fenlason@redhat.com) found a bug,
that recvfrom() on an RDS socket can return the contents of random kernel
memory to userspace if it was called with a address length larger than
sizeof(struct sockaddr_in).
rds_recvmsg() also fails to set the addr_len paramater properly before
returning, but that's just a bug.
There are also a number of cases wher recvfrom() can return an entirely bogus
address. Anything in rds_recvmsg() that returns a non-negative value but does
not go through the "sin = (struct sockaddr_in *)msg->msg_name;" code path
at the end of the while(1) loop will return up to 128 bytes of kernel memory
to userspace.

And I write two test programs to reproduce this bug, you will see that in
rds_server, fromAddr will be overwritten and the following sock_fd will be
destroyed.
Yes, it is the programmer's fault to set msg_namelen incorrectly, but it is
better to make the kernel copy the real length of address to user space in
such case.

How to run the test programs ?
I test them on 32bit x86 system, 3.5.0-rc7.

1 compile
gcc -o rds_client rds_client.c
gcc -o rds_server rds_server.c

2 run ./rds_server on one console

3 run ./rds_client on another console

4 you will see something like:
server is waiting to receive data...
old socket fd=3
server received data from client:data from client
msg.msg_namelen=32
new socket fd=-1067277685

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-backport-oneiric](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-backport-oneiric) - Linux kernel backport from Oneiric

## Details

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers

that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit

this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](/security/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel

implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially

use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-3.0.0-26-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-backport-oneiric)
  -
  [3.0.0-26.42~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-26.42~lucid1)
* [linux-image-3.0.0-26-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-backport-oneiric)
  -
  [3.0.0-26.42~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-26.42~lucid1)
* [linux-image-3.0.0-26-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-backport-oneiric)
  -
  [3.0.0-26.42~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-26.42~lucid1)
* [linux-image-3.0.0-26-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-backport-oneiric)
  -
  [3.0.0-26.42~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-26.42~lucid1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1577-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

21 September 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's KVM (kernel virtual machine).

An administrative user in the guest OS could leverage this flaw to cause a

denial of service in the host OS. ([CVE-2012-2121](/security/CVE-2012-2121))

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers

that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit

this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](/security/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel

implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially

use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel.

([CVE-2012-3430](/security/CVE-2012-3430))

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel's memory

subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a

denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-3511](/security/CVE-2012-3511))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [linux-image-2.6.38-1209-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [2.6.38-1209.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/2.6.38-1209.26)

commit 54d4d42b2558d2053519852dfef7ded62775e058

ARM: 7467/1: mutex: use generic xchg-based implementation for ARMv6+
commit a76d7bd96d65fa5119adba97e1b58d95f2e78829 upstream.
The open-coded mutex implementation for ARMv6+ cores suffers from a
severe lack of barriers, so in the uncontended case we don't actually
protect any accesses performed during the critical section.
Furthermore, the code is largely a duplication of the ARMv6+ atomic\_dec
code but optimised to remove a branch instruction, as the mutex fastpath
was previously inlined. Now that this is executed out-of-line, we can
reuse the atomic access code for the locking (in fact, we use the xchg
code as this produces shorter critical sections).
This patch uses the generic xchg based implementation for mutexes on
ARMv6+, which introduces barriers to the lock/unlock operations and also
has the benefit of removing a fair amount of inline assembly code.

commit b15ab4ac6ae748d3552b0cb112dff5c9c567d4ca

USB: Fix race condition when removing host controllers
commit 0d00dc2611abbe6ad244d50569c2ee82ce42846c upstream.
This patch (as1607) fixes a race that can occur if a USB host
controller is removed while a process is reading the
/sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices file.
The usb\_device\_read() routine uses the bus->root\_hub pointer to
determine whether or not the root hub is registered. The is not a
valid test, because the pointer is set before the root hub gets
registered and remains set even after the root hub is unregistered and
deallocated. As a result, usb\_device\_read() or usb\_device\_dump() can
access freed memory, causing an oops.
The patch changes the test to use the hcd->rh\_registered flag, which
does get set and cleared at the appropriate times. It also makes sure
to hold the usb\_bus\_list\_lock mutex while setting the flag, so that
usb\_device\_read() will become aware of new root hubs as soon as they
are registered.

MCE: Fix vm86 handling for 32bit mce handler
commit a129a7c84582629741e5fa6f40026efcd7a65bd4 upstream.
When running on 32bit the mce handler could misinterpret
vm86 mode as ring 0. This can affect whether it does recovery
or not; it was possible to panic when recovery was actually
possible.
Fix this by always forcing vm86 to look like ring 3.
[ Backport to 3.0 notes:
Things changed there slightly:
- move mce\_get\_rip() up. It fills up m->cs and m->ip values which
are evaluated in mce\_severity(). Therefore move it up right before
the mce\_severity call. This seem to be another bug in 3.0?
- Place the backport (fix m->cs in V86 case) to where m->cs gets
filled which is mce\_get\_rip() in 3.0

sched: Fix ancient race in do\_exit()
commit b5740f4b2cb3503b436925eb2242bc3d75cd3dfe upstream.
try\_to\_wake\_up() has a problem which may change status from TASK\_DEAD to
TASK\_RUNNING in race condition with SMI or guest environment of virtual
machine. As a result, exited task is scheduled() again and panic occurs.
Here is the sequence how it occurs:
----------------------------------+-----------------------------
|
CPU A | CPU B
----------------------------------+-----------------------------
TASK A calls exit()....
do\_exit()
exit\_mm()
down\_read(mm->mmap\_sem);
rwsem\_down\_failed\_common()
set TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
set waiter.task <= task A
list\_add to sem->wait\_list
:
raw\_spin\_unlock\_irq()
(I/O interruption occured)
\_\_rwsem\_do\_wake(mmap\_sem)
list\_del(&waiter->list);
waiter->task = NULL
wake\_up\_process(task A)
try\_to\_wake\_up()
(task is still
TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLE)
p->on\_rq is still 1.)
ttwu\_do\_wakeup()
(\*A)
:
(I/O interruption handler finished)
if (!waiter.task)
schedule() is not called
due to waiter.task is NULL.
tsk->state = TASK\_RUNNING
:
check\_preempt\_curr();
:
task->state = TASK\_DEAD
(\*B)
<--- set TASK\_RUNNING (\*C)
schedule()
(exit task is running again)
BUG\_ON() is called!
--------------------------------------------------------
The execution time between (\*A) and (\*B) is usually very short,
because the interruption is disabled, and setting TASK\_RUNNING at (\*C)
must be executed before setting TASK\_DEAD.
HOWEVER, if SMI is interrupted between (\*A) and (\*B),
(\*C) is able to execute AFTER setting TASK\_DEAD!
Then, exited task is scheduled again, and BUG\_ON() is called....
If the system works on guest system of virtual machine, the time
between (\*A) and (\*B) may be also long due to scheduling of hypervisor,
and same phenomenon can occur.
By this patch, do\_exit() waits for releasing task->pi\_lock which is used
in try\_to\_wake\_up(). It guarantees the task becomes TASK\_DEAD after
waking up.

spi/spi-fsl-spi: reference correct pdata in fsl\_spi\_cs\_control
commit 067aa4815a9bc12a569d8a06afef50ba5773afbf upstream.
Commit 178db7d3, "spi: Fix device unregistration when unregistering

to be the master's device pointer instead of his parent.
This introduced a bug in spi-fsl-spi, since its usage of spi device
pointer was not updated accordingly. This was later fixed by commit

UBI: fix a horrible memory deallocation bug
commit 78b495c39add820ab66ab897af9bd77a5f2e91f6 upstream
UBI was mistakingly using 'kfree()' instead of 'kmem\_cache\_free()' when
freeing "attach eraseblock" structures in vtbl.c. Thankfully, this happened
only when we were doing auto-format, so many systems were unaffected. However,
there are still many users affected.
It is strange, but the system did not crash and nothing bad happened when
the SLUB memory allocator was used. However, in case of SLOB we observed an
crash right away.
This problem was introduced in 2.6.39 by commit
"6c1e875 UBI: add slab cache for ubi\_scan\_leb objects"

mmc: Prevent 1.8V switch for SD hosts that don't support UHS modes.
commit 4188bba0e9e7ba58d231b528df495666f2742b74 upstream.
The driver should not try to switch to 1.8V when the SD 3.0 host
controller does not have any UHS capabilities bits set (SDR50, DDR50
or SDR104). See page 72 of "SD Specifications Part A2 SD Host
Controller Simplified Specification Version 3.00" under
"1.8V Signaling Enable". Instead of setting SDR12 and SDR25 in the host
capabilities data structure for all V3.0 host controllers, only set them
if SDR104, SDR50 or DDR50 is set in the host capabilities register. This
will prevent the switch to 1.8V later.

mmc: sd: Handle SD3.0 cards not supporting UHS-I bus speed mode
commit f2815f68dabbb373fd1c9f0fd4a609d486697c2b upstream.
Here is Essential conditions to indicate Version 3.00 Card
(SD\_SPEC=2 and SD\_SPEC3=1) :
(1) The card shall support CMD6
(2) The card shall support CMD8
(3) The card shall support CMD42
(4) User area capacity shall be up to 2GB (SDSC) or 32GB (SDHC)
User area capacity shall be more than or equal to 32GB and
up to 2TB (SDXC)
(5) Speed Class shall be supported (SDHC or SDXC)
So even if SD card doesn't support any of the newly defined
UHS-I bus speed mode, it can advertise itself as SD3.0 cards
as long as it supports all the essential conditions of
SD3.0 cards. Given this, these type of cards should atleast
run in High Speed mode @50MHZ if it supports HS.
But current initialization sequence for SD3.0 cards is
such that these non-UHS-I SD3.0 cards runs in Default
Speed mode @25MHz.
This patch makes sure that these non-UHS-I SD3.0 cards run
in High Speed Mode @50MHz.
Tested this patch with SanDisk Extreme SDHC 8GB Class 10 card.

media: Avoid sysfs oops when an rc\_dev's raw device is absent
commit 720bb6436ff30fccad05cf5bdf961ea5b1f5686d upstream.
For some reason, when the lirc daemon learns that a usb remote control
has been unplugged, it wants to read the sysfs attributes of the
disappearing device. This is useful for uncovering transient
inconsistencies, but less so for keeping the system running when such
inconsistencies exist.
Under some circumstances (like every time I unplug my dvb stick from
my laptop), lirc catches an rc\_dev whose raw event handler has been
removed (presumably by ir\_raw\_event\_unregister), and proceeds to
interrogate the raw protocols supported by the NULL pointer.
This patch avoids the NULL dereference, and ignores the issue of how
this state of affairs came about in the first place.
Version 2 incorporates changes recommended by Mauro Carvalho Chehab

time: Move ktime\_t overflow checking into timespec\_valid\_strict
commit cee58483cf56e0ba355fdd97ff5e8925329aa936 upstream
Andreas Bombe reported that the added ktime\_t overflow checking added to
timespec\_valid in commit 4e8b14526ca7 ("time: Improve sanity checking of
timekeeping inputs") was causing problems with X.org because it caused
timeouts larger then KTIME\_T to be invalid.
Previously, these large timeouts would be clamped to KTIME\_MAX and would
never expire, which is valid.
This patch splits the ktime\_t overflow checking into a new
timespec\_valid\_strict function, and converts the timekeeping codes
internal checking to use this more strict function.

time: Improve sanity checking of timekeeping inputs
commit 4e8b14526ca7fb046a81c94002c1c43b6fdf0e9b upstream
Unexpected behavior could occur if the time is set to a value large
enough to overflow a 64bit ktime\_t (which is something larger then the
year 2262).
Also unexpected behavior could occur if large negative offsets are
injected via adjtimex.
So this patch improves the sanity check timekeeping inputs by
improving the timespec\_valid() check, and then makes better use of
timespec\_valid() to make sure we don't set the time to an invalid
negative value or one that overflows ktime\_t.
Note: This does not protect from setting the time close to overflowing
ktime\_t and then letting natural accumulation cause the overflow.

drop\_monitor: prevent init path from scheduling on the wrong cpu
commit 4fdcfa12843bca38d0c9deff70c8720e4e8f515f upstream.
I just noticed after some recent updates, that the init path for the drop
monitor protocol has a minor error. drop monitor maintains a per cpu structure,
that gets initalized from a single cpu. Normally this is fine, as the protocol
isn't in use yet, but I recently made a change that causes a failed skb
allocation to reschedule itself . Given the current code, the implication is
that this workqueue reschedule will take place on the wrong cpu. If drop
monitor is used early during the boot process, its possible that two cpus will
access a single per-cpu structure in parallel, possibly leading to data
corruption.
This patch fixes the situation, by storing the cpu number that a given instance
of this per-cpu data should be accessed from. In the case of a need for a
reschedule, the cpu stored in the struct is assigned the rescheule, rather than
the currently executing cpu
Tested successfully by myself.

It stems from holding a spinlock (trace\_state\_lock) while attempting to register
or unregister tracepoint hooks, making in\_atomic() true in this context, leading
to the warning when the tracepoint calls might\_sleep() while its taking a mutex.
Since we only use the trace\_state\_lock to prevent trace protocol state races, as
well as hardware stat list updates on an rcu write side, we can just convert the
spinlock to a mutex to avoid this problem.

media: lirc\_sir: make device registration work
commit 4b71ca6bce8fab3d08c61bf330e781f957934ae1 upstream.
For one, the driver device pointer needs to be filled in, or the lirc core
will refuse to load the driver. And we really need to wire up all the
platform\_device bits. This has been tested via the lirc sourceforge tree
and verified to work, been sitting there for months, finally getting
around to sending it. :\

sched: Fix race in task\_group()
commit 8323f26ce3425460769605a6aece7a174edaa7d1 upstream.
Stefan reported a crash on a kernel before a3e5d1091c1 ("sched:
Don't call task\_group() too many times in set\_task\_rq()"), he
found the reason to be that the multiple task\_group()
invocations in set\_task\_rq() returned different values.
Looking at all that I found a lack of serialization and plain
wrong comments.
The below tries to fix it using an extra pointer which is
updated under the appropriate scheduler locks. Its not pretty,
but I can't really see another way given how all the cgroup
stuff works.

cpufreq / ACPI: Fix not loading acpi-cpufreq driver regression
commit c4686c71a9183f76e3ef59098da5c098748672f6 upstream.
Commit d640113fe80e45ebd4a5b420b introduced a regression on SMP
systems where the processor core with ACPI id zero is disabled
(typically should be the case because of hyperthreading).
The regression got spread through stable kernels.
On 3.0.X it got introduced via 3.0.18.
Such platforms may be rare, but do exist.
Look out for a disabled processor with acpi\_id 0 in dmesg:
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi\_id[0x00] lapic\_id[0x10] disabled)
This problem has been observed on a:
HP Proliant BL280c G6 blade
This patch restricts the introduced workaround to platforms
with nr\_cpu\_ids <= 1.

libata: Prevent interface errors with Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex
commit c531077f40abc9f2129c4c83a30b3f8d6ce1c0e7 upstream.
When using my Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex eSATAp external disk enclosure,
interface errors are always seen until 1.5Gbps is negotiated [1]. This
occurs using any disk in the enclosure, and when the disk is connected
directly with a generic passive eSATAp cable, we see stable 3Gbps
operation as expected.
Blacklist 3Gbps mode to avoid dataloss and the ~30s delay bus reset
and renegotiation incurs.

rds: set correct msg\_namelen
commit 06b6a1cf6e776426766298d055bb3991957d90a7 upstream.
Jay Fenlason (fenlason@redhat.com) found a bug,
that recvfrom() on an RDS socket can return the contents of random kernel
memory to userspace if it was called with a address length larger than
sizeof(struct sockaddr\_in).
rds\_recvmsg() also fails to set the addr\_len paramater properly before
returning, but that's just a bug.
There are also a number of cases wher recvfrom() can return an entirely bogus
address. Anything in rds\_recvmsg() that returns a non-negative value but does
not go through the "sin = (struct sockaddr\_in \*)msg->msg\_name;" code path
at the end of the while(1) loop will return up to 128 bytes of kernel memory
to userspace.
And I write two test programs to reproduce this bug, you will see that in
rds\_server, fromAddr will be overwritten and the following sock\_fd will be
destroyed.
Yes, it is the programmer's fault to set msg\_namelen incorrectly, but it is
better to make the kernel copy the real length of address to user space in
such case.
How to run the test programs ?
I test them on 32bit x86 system, 3.5.0-rc7.
1 compile
gcc -o rds\_client rds\_client.c
gcc -o rds\_server rds\_server.c
2 run ./rds\_server on one console
3 run ./rds\_client on another console

Fix a dead loop in async\_synchronize\_full()
[Fixed upstream by commits 2955b47d2c1983998a8c5915cb96884e67f7cb53 and
a4683487f90bfe3049686fc5c566bdc1ad03ace6 from Dan Williams, but they are much
more intrusive than this tiny fix, according to Andrew - gregkh]
This patch tries to fix a dead loop in async\_synchronize\_full(), which
could be seen when preemption is disabled on a single cpu machine.
void async\_synchronize\_full(void)
{
do {
async\_synchronize\_cookie(next\_cookie);
} while (!list\_empty(&async\_running) || !
list\_empty(&async\_pending));
}
async\_synchronize\_cookie() calls async\_synchronize\_cookie\_domain() with
&async\_running as the default domain to synchronize.
However, there might be some works in the async\_pending list from other
domains. On a single cpu system, without preemption, there is no chance
for the other works to finish, so async\_synchronize\_full() enters a dead
loop.
It seems async\_synchronize\_full() wants to synchronize all entries in
all running lists(domains), so maybe we could just check the entry\_count
to know whether all works are finished.
Currently, async\_synchronize\_cookie\_domain() expects a non-NULL running
list ( if NULL, there would be NULL pointer dereference ), so maybe a
NULL pointer could be used as an indication for the functions to
synchronize all works in all domains.

workqueue: UNBOUND -> REBIND morphing in rebind\_workers() should be atomic
commit 96e65306b81351b656835c15931d1d237b252f27 upstream.
The compiler may compile the following code into TWO write/modify
instructions.
worker->flags &= ~WORKER\_UNBOUND;
worker->flags |= WORKER\_REBIND;
so the other CPU may temporarily see worker->flags which doesn't have
either WORKER\_UNBOUND or WORKER\_REBIND set and perform local wakeup
prematurely.
Fix it by using single explicit assignment via ACCESS\_ONCE().
Because idle workers have another WORKER\_NOT\_RUNNING flag, this bug
doesn't exist for them; however, update it to use the same pattern for
consistency.

Clear Audio Enable bit to trigger unsolicated event to notify Audio
Driver part the HDMI hot plug change. The patch fixed the bug when
remove HDMI cable the bit was not cleared correctly.
In intel\_hdmi\_dpms(), if intel\_hdmi->has\_audio been true, the "Audio enable bit" will
be set to trigger unsolicated event to notify Alsa driver the change.
intel\_hdmi->has\_audio will be reset to false from intel\_hdmi\_detect() after
remove the hdmi cable, here's debug log:
[ 187.494153] [drm:output\_poll\_execute], [CONNECTOR:17:HDMI-A-1] status updated from 1 to 2
[ 187.525349] [drm:intel\_hdmi\_detect], HDMI: has\_audio = 0
so when comes back to intel\_hdmi\_dpms(), the "Audio enable bit" will not be cleared. And this
cause the eld infomation and pin presence doesnot update accordingly in alsa driver side.
This patch will also trigger unsolicated event to alsa driver to notify the hot plug event:

fbcon: fix race condition between console lock and cursor timer (v1.1)
commit d8636a2717bb3da2a7ce2154bf08de90bb8c87b0 upstream.
So we've had a fair few reports of fbcon handover breakage between
efi/vesafb and i915 surface recently, so I dedicated a couple of
days to finding the problem.
Essentially the last thing we saw was the conflicting framebuffer
message and that was all.
So after much tracing with direct netconsole writes (printks
under console\_lock not so useful), I think I found the race.
Thread A (driver load) Thread B (timer thread)
unbind\_con\_driver -> |
bind\_con\_driver -> |
vc->vc\_sw->con\_deinit -> |
fbcon\_deinit -> |
console\_lock() |
| |
| fbcon\_flashcursor timer fires
| console\_lock() <- blocked for A
|
|
fbcon\_del\_cursor\_timer ->
del\_timer\_sync
(BOOM)
Of course because all of this is under the console lock,
we never see anything, also since we also just unbound the active
console guess what we never see anything.
Hopefully this fixes the problem for anyone seeing vesafb->kms
driver handoff.
v1.1: add comment suggestion from Alan.

drivers/misc/sgi-xp/xpc\_uv.c: SGI XPC fails to load when cpu 0 is out of IRQ resources
commit 7838f994b4fceff24c343f4e26a6cf4393869579 upstream.
On many of our larger systems, CPU 0 has had all of its IRQ resources
consumed before XPC loads. Worst cases on machines with multiple 10
GigE cards and multiple IB cards have depleted the entire first socket
of IRQs.
This patch makes selecting the node upon which IRQs are allocated (as
well as all the other GRU Message Queue structures) specifiable as a

PM / Runtime: Clear power.deferred\_resume on success in rpm\_suspend()
commit 58a34de7b1a920d287d17d2ca08bc9aaf7e6d35b upstream.
The power.deferred\_resume can only be set if the runtime PM status
of device is RPM\_SUSPENDING and it should be cleared after its
status has been changed, regardless of whether or not the runtime
suspend has been successful. However, it only is cleared on
suspend failure, while it may remain set on successful suspend and
is happily leaked to rpm\_resume() executed in that case.
That shouldn't happen, so if power.deferred\_resume is set in
rpm\_suspend() after the status has been changed to RPM\_SUSPENDED,
clear it before calling rpm\_resume(). Then, it doesn't need to be
cleared before changing the status to RPM\_SUSPENDING any more,
because it's always cleared after the status has been changed to
either RPM\_SUSPENDED (on success) or RPM\_ACTIVE (on failure).

PM / Runtime: Fix rpm\_resume() return value for power.no\_callbacks set
commit 7f321c26c04807834fef4c524d2b21573423fc74 upstream.
For devices whose power.no\_callbacks flag is set, rpm\_resume()
should return 1 if the device's parent is already active, so that
the callers of pm\_runtime\_get() don't think that they have to wait
for the device to resume (asynchronously) in that case (the core
won't queue up an asynchronous resume in that case, so there's
nothing to wait for anyway).
Modify the code accordingly (and make sure that an idle notification
will be queued up on success, even if 1 is to be returned).

drivers/rtc/rtc-rs5c348.c: fix hour decoding in 12-hour mode
commit 7dbfb315b2aaef0a115765946bf3026d074c33a7 upstream.
Correct the offset by subtracting 20 from tm\_hour before taking the
modulo 12.
[ "Why 20?" I hear you ask. Or at least I did.
Here's the reason why: RS5C348\_BIT\_PM is 32, and is - stupidly -
included in the RS5C348\_HOURS\_MASK define. So it's really subtracting
out that bit to get "hour+12". But then because it does things modulo
12, it needs to add the 12 in again afterwards anyway.
This code is confused. It would be much clearer if RS5C348\_HOURS\_MASK
just didn't include the RS5C348\_BIT\_PM bit at all, then it wouldn't
need to do the silly subtract either.
Whatever. It's all just math, the end result is the same. - Linus ]

mutex: Place lock in contended state after fastpath\_lock failure
commit 0bce9c46bf3b15f485d82d7e81dabed6ebcc24b1 upstream.
ARM recently moved to asm-generic/mutex-xchg.h for its mutex
implementation after the previous implementation was found to be missing
some crucial memory barriers. However, this has revealed some problems
running hackbench on SMP platforms due to the way in which the
MUTEX\_SPIN\_ON\_OWNER code operates.
The symptoms are that a bunch of hackbench tasks are left waiting on an
unlocked mutex and therefore never get woken up to claim it. This boils
down to the following sequence of events:
Task A Task B Task C Lock value
0 1
1 lock() 0
2 lock() 0
3 spin(A) 0
4 unlock() 1
5 lock() 0
6 cmpxchg(1,0) 0
7 contended() -1
8 lock() 0
9 spin(C) 0
10 unlock() 1
11 cmpxchg(1,0) 0
12 unlock() 1
At this point, the lock is unlocked, but Task B is in an uninterruptible
sleep with nobody to wake it up.
This patch fixes the problem by ensuring we put the lock into the
contended state if we fail to acquire it on the fastpath, ensuring that
any blocked waiters are woken up when the mutex is released.

xhci: Fix bug after deq ptr set to link TRB.
commit 50d0206fcaea3e736f912fd5b00ec6233fb4ce44 upstream.
This patch fixes a particularly nasty bug that was revealed by the ring
expansion patches. The bug has been present since the very beginning of
the xHCI driver history, and could have caused general protection faults
from bad memory accesses.
The first thing to note is that a Set TR Dequeue Pointer command can
move the dequeue pointer to a link TRB, if the canceled or stalled
transfer TD ended just before a link TRB. The function to increment the
dequeue pointer, inc\_deq, was written before cancellation and stall
support was added. It assumed that the dequeue pointer could never
point to a link TRB. It would unconditionally increment the dequeue
pointer at the start of the function, check if the pointer was now on a
link TRB, and move it to the top of the next segment if so.
This means that if a Set TR Dequeue Point command moved the dequeue
pointer to a link TRB, a subsequent call to inc\_deq() would move the
pointer off the segment and into la-la-land. It would then read from
that memory to determine if it was a link TRB. Other functions would
often call inc\_deq() until the dequeue pointer matched some other
pointer, which means this function would quite happily read all of
system memory before wrapping around to the right pointer value.
Often, there would be another endpoint segment from a different ring
allocated from the same DMA pool, which would be contiguous to the
segment inc\_deq just stepped off of. inc\_deq would eventually find the
link TRB in that segment, and blindly move the dequeue pointer back to
the top of the correct ring segment.
The only reason the original code worked at all is because there was
only one ring segment. With the ring expansion patches, the dequeue
pointer would eventually wrap into place, but the dequeue segment would
be out-of-sync. On the second TD after the dequeue pointer was moved to
a link TRB, trb\_in\_td() would fail (because the dequeue pointer and
dequeue segment were out-of-sync), and this message would appear:
ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD
This fixes bugzilla entry 4333 (option-based modem unhappy on USB 3.0
port: "Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD", "rejecting
I/O to offline device"),
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=43333
and possibly other general protection fault bugs as well.
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31. A separate
patch will be created for kernels older than 3.4, since inc\_deq was
modified in 3.4 and this patch will not apply.

xhci: Make handover code more robust
commit e955a1cd086de4d165ae0f4c7be7289d84b63bdc upstream.
My test platform (Intel DX79SI) boots reliably under BIOS, but frequently
crashes when booting via UEFI. I finally tracked this down to the xhci
handoff code. It seems that reads from the device occasionally just return
0xff, resulting in xhci\_find\_next\_cap\_offset generating a value that's
larger than the resource region. We then oops when attempting to read the
value. Sanity checking that value lets us avoid the crash.
I've no idea what's causing the underlying problem, and xhci still doesn't
actually \*work\* even with this, but the machine at least boots which will
probably make further debugging easier.

EHCI: Update qTD next pointer in QH overlay region during unlink
commit 3d037774b42ed677f699b1dce7d548d55f4e4c2b upstream.
There is a possibility of QH overlay region having reference to a stale
qTD pointer during unlink.
Consider an endpoint having two pending qTD before unlink process begins.
The endpoint's QH queue looks like this.
qTD1 --> qTD2 --> Dummy
To unlink qTD2, QH is removed from asynchronous list and Asynchronous
Advance Doorbell is programmed. The qTD1's next qTD pointer is set to
qTD2'2 next qTD pointer and qTD2 is retired upon controller's doorbell
interrupt. If QH's current qTD pointer points to qTD1, transfer overlay
region still have reference to qTD2. But qtD2 is just unlinked and freed.
This may cause EHCI system error. Fix this by updating qTD next pointer
in QH overlay region with the qTD next pointer of the current qTD.

When the NFS\_COOKIEVERF helper macro was converted into a static

helpers to static inline), we broke the initialisation of the
readdir cookies, since that depended on doing a memset with an
argument of 'sizeof(NFS\_COOKIEVERF(inode))' which therefore
changed from sizeof(be32 cookieverf[2]) to sizeof(be32 \*).
At this point, NFS\_COOKIEVERF seems to be more of an obfuscation
than a helper, so the best thing would be to just get rid of it.

kicks off it will first lock reg\_regdb\_search\_mutex and
later cfg80211\_mutex but to ensure two CPUs will not contend
against cfg80211\_mutex the right thing to do is to have the

This patch fixes an oops which occurs when unloading the driver, while the
network interface is still up. The problem is that first the io mapping is
teared own, then the CAN device is unregistered, resulting in accessing the
hardware's iomem:

kdump can be interrupted by watchdog timer when the timer is left

watchdog timer at boot-time. This assures that watchdog timer is
disabled until /dev/watchdog is opened, and prevents watchdog timer

SCSI: hpsa: fix handling of protocol error
commit 256d0eaac87da1e993190846064f339f4c7a63f5 upstream.
If a command status of CMD\_PROTOCOL\_ERR is received, this
information should be conveyed to the SCSI mid layer, not
dropped on the floor. CMD\_PROTOCOL\_ERR may be received
from the Smart Array for any commands destined for an external
RAID controller such as a P2000, or commands destined for tape
drives or CD/DVD-ROM drives, if for instance a cable is
disconnected. This mostly affects multipath configurations, as
disconnecting a cable on a non-multipath configuration is not
going to do anything good regardless of whether CMD\_PROTOCOL\_ERR
is handled correctly or not. Not handling CMD\_PROTOCOL\_ERR
correctly in a multipath configaration involving external RAID
controllers may cause data corruption, so this is quite a serious
bug. This bug should not normally cause a problem for direct
attached disk storage.

SCSI: bnx2i: Fixed NULL ptr deference for 1G bnx2 Linux iSCSI offload
commit d6532207116307eb7ecbfa7b9e02c53230096a50 upstream.
This patch fixes the following kernel panic invoked by uninitialized fields
in the chip initialization for the 1G bnx2 iSCSI offload.
One of the bits in the chip initialization is being used by the latest
firmware to control overflow packets. When this control bit gets enabled
erroneously, it would ultimately result in a bad packet placement which would
cause the bnx2 driver to dereference a NULL ptr in the placement handler.
This can happen under certain stress I/O environment under the Linux
iSCSI offload operation.
This change only affects Broadcom's 5709 chipset.

xen/boot: Disable NUMA for PV guests.
commit 8d54db795dfb1049d45dc34f0dddbc5347ec5642 upstream.
The hypervisor is in charge of allocating the proper "NUMA" memory
and dealing with the CPU scheduler to keep them bound to the proper
NUMA node. The PV guests (and PVHVM) have no inkling of where they
run and do not need to know that right now. In the future we will
need to inject NUMA configuration data (if a guest spans two or more
NUMA nodes) so that the kernel can make the right choices. But those
patches are not yet present.
In the meantime, disable the NUMA capability in the PV guest, which
also fixes a bootup issue. Andre says:
"we see Dom0 crashes due to the kernel detecting the NUMA topology not
by ACPI, but directly from the northbridge (CONFIG\_AMD\_NUMA).
This will detect the actual NUMA config of the physical machine, but
will crash about the mismatch with Dom0's virtual memory. Variation of
the theme: Dom0 sees what it's not supposed to see.
This happens with the said config option enabled and on a machine where
this scanning is still enabled (K8 and Fam10h, not Bulldozer class)
We have this dump then:

memory hotplug: fix section info double registration bug
commit f14851af0ebb32745c6c5a2e400aa0549f9d20df upstream.
There may be a bug when registering section info. For example, on my
Itanium platform, the pfn range of node0 includes the other nodes, so
other nodes' section info will be double registered, and memmap's page
count will equal to 3.
node0: start\_pfn=0x100, spanned\_pfn=0x20fb00, present\_pfn=0x7f8a3, => 0x000100-0x20fc00
node1: start\_pfn=0x80000, spanned\_pfn=0x80000, present\_pfn=0x80000, => 0x080000-0x100000
node2: start\_pfn=0x100000, spanned\_pfn=0x80000, present\_pfn=0x80000, => 0x100000-0x180000
node3: start\_pfn=0x180000, spanned\_pfn=0x80000, present\_pfn=0x80000, => 0x180000-0x200000
free\_all\_bootmem\_node()
register\_page\_bootmem\_info\_node()

When hot remove memory, we can't free the memmap's page because
page\_count() is 2 after put\_page\_bootmem().

mm/ia64: fix a memory block size bug
commit 05cf96398e1b6502f9e191291b715c7463c9d5dd upstream.
I found following definition in include/linux/memory.h, in my IA64
platform, SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS is equal to 32, and MIN\_MEMORY\_BLOCK\_SIZE
will be 0.
#define MIN\_MEMORY\_BLOCK\_SIZE (1 << SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS)
Because MIN\_MEMORY\_BLOCK\_SIZE is int type and length of 32bits,
so MIN\_MEMORY\_BLOCK\_SIZE(1 << 32) will will equal to 0.
Actually when SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS >= 31, MIN\_MEMORY\_BLOCK\_SIZE will be wrong.
This will cause wrong system memory infomation in sysfs.
I think it should be:
#define MIN\_MEMORY\_BLOCK\_SIZE (1UL << SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS)
And "echo offline > memory0/state" will cause following call trace:

can: mcp251x: avoid repeated frame bug
commit cab32f39dcc5b35db96497dc0a026b5dea76e4e7 upstream.
The MCP2515 has a silicon bug causing repeated frame transmission, see section
5 of MCP2515 Rev. B Silicon Errata Revision G (March 2007).
Basically, setting TXBnCTRL.TXREQ in either SPI mode (00 or 11) will eventually
cause the bug. The workaround proposed by Microchip is to use mode 00 and send
a RTS command on the SPI bus to initiate the transmission.

drivers/rtc/rtc-twl.c: ensure all interrupts are disabled during probe
commit 8dcebaa9a0ae8a0487f4342f3d56d2cb1c980860 upstream.
On some platforms, bootloaders are known to do some interesting RTC
programming. Without going into the obscurities as to why this may be
the case, suffice it to say the the driver should not make any
assumptions about the state of the RTC when the driver loads. In
particular, the driver probe should be sure that all interrupts are
disabled until otherwise programmed.
This was discovered when finding bursty I2C traffic every second on
Overo platforms. This I2C overhead was keeping the SoC from hitting
deep power states. The cause was found to be the RTC firing every
second on the I2C-connected TWL PMIC.
Special thanks to Felipe Balbi for suggesting to look for a rogue driver
as the source of the I2C traffic rather than the I2C driver itself.
Special thanks to Steve Sakoman for helping track down the source of the
continuous RTC interrups on the Overo boards.

mm/page\_alloc: fix the page address of higher page's buddy calculation
commit 0ba8f2d59304dfe69b59c034de723ad80f7ab9ac upstream.
The heuristic method for buddy has been introduced since commit
43506fad21ca ("mm/page\_alloc.c: simplify calculation of combined index
of adjacent buddy lists"). But the page address of higher page's buddy
was wrongly calculated, which will lead page\_is\_buddy to fail for ever.
IOW, the heuristic method would be disabled with the wrong page address
of higher page's buddy.
Calculating the page address of higher page's buddy should be based
higher\_page with the offset between index of higher page and index of
higher page's buddy.

changed 0.90 metadata handling to truncated size to 4TB as that is
all that 0.90 can record.
However for RAID0 and Linear, 0.90 doesn't need to record the size, so
this truncation is not needed and causes working arrays to become too small.
So avoid the truncation for RAID0 and Linear

Redefine ATOMIC\_INIT and ATOMIC64\_INIT to drop the casts
commit 67a806d9499353fabd5b5ff07337f3aa88a1c3ba upstream.
The following build error occurred during an alpha build:
net/core/sock.c:274:36: error: initializer element is not constant
Dave Anglin says:
> Here is the line in sock.i:
>
> struct static\_key memalloc\_socks = ((struct static\_key) { .enabled =
> ((atomic\_t) { (0) }) });
The above line contains two compound literals. It also uses a designated
initializer to initialize the field enabled. A compound literal is not a
constant expression.
The location of the above statement isn't fully clear, but if a compound
literal occurs outside the body of a function, the initializer list must
consist of constant expressions.

This is a completely different CONFIG\_HOTPLUG problem, only
demonstrating another reason why CONFIG\_HOTPLUG should go away. I had a
hard time trying to disable it anyway ;-)
The problem this time is lots of code assuming that a call to
add\_uevent\_var() will guarantee that env->buflen > 0. This is not true
if CONFIG\_HOTPLUG is unset. So things like this end up overwriting
env->envp\_idx because the array index is -1:
if (add\_uevent\_var(env, "MODALIAS="))
return -ENOMEM;
len = input\_print\_modalias(&env->buf[env->buflen - 1],
sizeof(env->buf) - env->buflen,
dev, 0);
Don't know what the best action is, given that there seem to be a \*lot\*
of this around the kernel. This patch "fixes" the problem for me, but I
don't know if it can be considered an appropriate fix.
[ It is the correct fix for now, for 3.7 forcing CONFIG\_HOTPLUG to
always be on is the longterm fix, but it's too late for 3.6 and older
kernels to resolve this that way - gregkh ]

"if (clock == 0)" where ESDHC\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL has been operated. This

perf\_event: Switch to internal refcount, fix race with close()
commit a6fa941d94b411bbd2b6421ffbde6db3c93e65ab upstream.
Don't mess with file refcounts (or keep a reference to file, for
that matter) in perf\_event. Use explicit refcount of its own
instead. Deal with the race between the final reference to event
going away and new children getting created for it by use of
atomic\_long\_inc\_not\_zero() in inherit\_event(); just have the
latter free what it had allocated and return NULL, that works
out just fine (children of siblings of something doomed are
created as singletons, same as if the child of leader had been
created and immediately killed).

target: Fix ->data\_length re-assignment bug with SCSI overflow
commit 4c054ba63ad47ef244cfcfa1cea38134620a5bae upstream.
This patch fixes a long-standing bug with SCSI overflow handling
where se\_cmd->data\_length was incorrectly being re-assigned to
the larger CDB extracted allocation length, resulting in a number
of fabric level errors that would end up causing a session reset
in most cases. So instead now:
- Only re-assign se\_cmd->data\_length durining UNDERFLOW (to use the
smaller value)
- Use existing se\_cmd->data\_length for OVERFLOW (to use the smaller
value)
This fix has been tested with the following CDB to generate an
SCSI overflow:
sg\_raw -r512 /dev/sdc 28 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
Tested using iscsi-target, tcm\_qla2xxx, loopback and tcm\_vhost fabric
ports. Here is a bit more detail on each case:
- iscsi-target: Bug with open-iscsi with overflow, sg\_raw returns
-3584 bytes of data.
- tcm\_qla2xxx: Working as expected, returnins 512 bytes of data
- loopback: sg\_raw returns CHECK\_CONDITION, from overflow rejection
in transport\_generic\_map\_mem\_to\_cmd()
- tcm\_vhost: Same as loopback

eCryptfs: Copy up attributes of the lower target inode after rename
commit 8335eafc2859e1a26282bef7c3d19f3d68868b8a upstream.
After calling into the lower filesystem to do a rename, the lower target
inode's attributes were not copied up to the eCryptfs target inode. This
resulted in the eCryptfs target inode staying around, rather than being
evicted, because i\_nlink was not updated for the eCryptfs inode. This
also meant that eCryptfs didn't do the final iput() on the lower target
inode so it stayed around, as well. This would result in a failure to
free up space occupied by the target file in the rename() operation.
Both target inodes would eventually be evicted when the eCryptfs
filesystem was unmounted.
This patch calls fsstack\_copy\_attr\_all() after the lower filesystem
does its ->rename() so that important inode attributes, such as i\_nlink,
are updated at the eCryptfs layer. ecryptfs\_evict\_inode() is now called
and eCryptfs can drop its final reference on the lower inode.

vfs: dcache: use DCACHE\_DENTRY\_KILLED instead of DCACHE\_DISCONNECTED in d\_kill()
commit b161dfa6937ae46d50adce8a7c6b12233e96e7bd upstream.
IBM reported a soft lockup after applying the fix for the rename\_lock
deadlock. Commit c83ce989cb5f ("VFS: Fix the nfs sillyrename regression
in kernel 2.6.38") was found to be the culprit.
The nfs sillyrename fix used DCACHE\_DISCONNECTED to indicate that the
dentry was killed. This flag can be set on non-killed dentries too,
which results in infinite retries when trying to traverse the dentry
tree.
This patch introduces a separate flag: DCACHE\_DENTRY\_KILLED, which is
only set in d\_kill() and makes try\_to\_ascend() test only this flag.
IBM reported successful test results with this patch.

vfs: make O\_PATH file descriptors usable for 'fstat()'
commit 55815f70147dcfa3ead5738fd56d3574e2e3c1c2 upstream.
We already use them for openat() and friends, but fstat() also wants to
be able to use O\_PATH file descriptors. This should make it more
directly comparable to the O\_SEARCH of Solaris.
Note that you could already do the same thing with "fstatat()" and an
empty path, but just doing "fstat()" directly is simpler and faster, so
there is no reason not to just allow it directly.
See also commit 332a2e1244bd, which did the same thing for fchdir, for
the same reasons.

cpufreq/powernow-k8: workqueue user shouldn't migrate the kworker to another CPU
commit 6889125b8b4e09c5e53e6ecab3433bed1ce198c9 upstream.
powernowk8\_target() runs off a per-cpu work item and if the
cpufreq\_policy->cpu is different from the current one, it migrates the
kworker to the target CPU by manipulating current->cpus\_allowed. The
function migrates the kworker back to the original CPU but this is
still broken. Workqueue concurrency management requires the kworkers
to stay on the same CPU and powernowk8\_target() ends up triggerring
BUG\_ON(rq != this\_rq()) in try\_to\_wake\_up\_local() if it contends on
fidvid\_mutex and sleeps.
It is unclear why this bug is being reported now. Duncan says it
appeared to be a regression of 3.6-rc1 and couldn't reproduce it on
3.5. Bisection seemed to point to 63d95a91 "workqueue: use @pool
instead of @gcwq or @cpu where applicable" which is an non-functional
change. Given that the reproduce case sometimes took upto days to
trigger, it's easy to be misled while bisecting. Maybe something made
contention on fidvid\_mutex more likely? I don't know.
This patch fixes the bug by using work\_on\_cpu() instead if @pol->cpu
isn't the same as the current one. The code assumes that
cpufreq\_policy->cpu is kept online by the caller, which Rafael tells
me is the case.
stable: ed48ece27c ("workqueue: reimplement work\_on\_cpu() using
system\_wq") should be applied before this; otherwise, the
behavior could be horrible.

workqueue: reimplement work\_on\_cpu() using system\_wq
commit ed48ece27cd3d5ee0354c32bbaec0f3e1d4715c3 upstream.
The existing work\_on\_cpu() implementation is hugely inefficient. It
creates a new kthread, execute that single function and then let the
kthread die on each invocation.
Now that system\_wq can handle concurrent executions, there's no
advantage of doing this. Reimplement work\_on\_cpu() using system\_wq
which makes it simpler and way more efficient.
stable: While this isn't a fix in itself, it's needed to fix a
workqueue related bug in cpufreq/powernow-k8. AFAICS, this
shouldn't break other existing users.

net: ipv4: ipmr\_expire\_timer causes crash when removing net namespace
[ Upstream commit acbb219d5f53821b2d0080d047800410c0420ea1 ]
When tearing down a net namespace, ipv4 mr\_table structures are freed
without first deactivating their timers. This can result in a crash in
run\_timer\_softirq.
This patch mimics the corresponding behaviour in ipv6.
Locking and synchronization seem to be adequate.
We are about to kfree mrt, so existing code should already make sure that
no other references to mrt are pending or can be created by incoming traffic.
The functions invoked here do not cause new references to mrt or other
race conditions to be created.
Invoking del\_timer\_sync guarantees that ipmr\_expire\_timer is inactive.
Both ipmr\_expire\_process (whose completion we may have to wait in
del\_timer\_sync) and mroute\_clean\_tables internally use mfc\_unres\_lock
or other synchronizations when needed, and they both only modify mrt.
Tested in Linux 3.4.8.

netlink: fix possible spoofing from non-root processes
[ Upstream commit 20e1db19db5d6b9e4e83021595eab0dc8f107bef ]
Non-root user-space processes can send Netlink messages to other
processes that are well-known for being subscribed to Netlink
asynchronous notifications. This allows ilegitimate non-root
process to send forged messages to Netlink subscribers.
The userspace process usually verifies the legitimate origin in
two ways:
a) Socket credentials. If UID != 0, then the message comes from
some ilegitimate process and the message needs to be dropped.
b) Netlink portID. In general, portID == 0 means that the origin
of the messages comes from the kernel. Thus, discarding any
message not coming from the kernel.
However, ctnetlink sets the portID in event messages that has
been triggered by some user-space process, eg. conntrack utility.
So other processes subscribed to ctnetlink events, eg. conntrackd,
know that the event was triggered by some user-space action.
Neither of the two ways to discard ilegitimate messages coming
from non-root processes can help for ctnetlink.
This patch adds capability validation in case that dst\_pid is set
in netlink\_sendmsg(). This approach is aggressive since existing
applications using any Netlink bus to deliver messages between
two user-space processes will break. Note that the exception is
NETLINK\_USERSOCK, since it is reserved for netlink-to-netlink
userspace communication.
Still, if anyone wants that his Netlink bus allows netlink-to-netlink
userspace, then they can set NL\_NONROOT\_SEND. However, by default,
I don't think it makes sense to allow to use NETLINK\_ROUTE to
communicate two processes that are sending no matter what information
that is not related to link/neighbouring/routing. They should be using
NETLINK\_USERSOCK instead for that.

Return an error instead when the socket is zapped to prevent the info
leak. Also remove the unnecessary memset(0). We don't directly write to

Bluetooth: HCI - Fix info leak via getsockname()
[ Upstream commit 3f68ba07b1da811bf383b4b701b129bfcb2e4988 ]
The HCI code fails to initialize the hci\_channel member of struct
sockaddr\_hci and that for leaks two bytes kernel stack via the
getsockname() syscall. Initialize hci\_channel with 0 to avoid the
info leak.

af\_packet: remove BUG statement in tpacket\_destruct\_skb
[ Upstream commit 7f5c3e3a80e6654cf48dfba7cf94f88c6b505467 ]
Here's a quote of the comment about the BUG macro from asm-generic/bug.h:
Don't use BUG() or BUG\_ON() unless there's really no way out; one
example might be detecting data structure corruption in the middle
of an operation that can't be backed out of. If the (sub)system
can somehow continue operating, perhaps with reduced functionality,
it's probably not BUG-worthy.
If you're tempted to BUG(), think again: is completely giving up
really the \*only\* solution? There are usually better options, where
users don't need to reboot ASAP and can mostly shut down cleanly.
In our case, the status flag of a ring buffer slot is managed from both sides,
the kernel space and the user space. This means that even though the kernel
side might work as expected, the user space screws up and changes this flag
right between the send(2) is triggered when the flag is changed to
TP\_STATUS\_SENDING and a given skb is destructed after some time. Then, this
will hit the BUG macro. As David suggested, the best solution is to simply
remove this statement since it cannot be used for kernel side internal
consistency checks. I've tested it and the system still behaves /stable/ in
this case, so in accordance with the above comment, we should rather remove it.

sfc: Fix maximum number of TSO segments and minimum TX queue size
[ Upstream commit 7e6d06f0de3f74ca929441add094518ae332257c ]
Currently an skb requiring TSO may not fit within a minimum-size TX
queue. The TX queue selected for the skb may stall and trigger the TX
watchdog repeatedly (since the problem skb will be retried after the
TX reset). This issue is designated as CVE-2012-3412.
Set the maximum number of TSO segments for our devices to 100. This
should make no difference to behaviour unless the actual MSS is less
than about 700. Increase the minimum TX queue size accordingly to
allow for 2 worst-case skbs, so that there will definitely be space
to add an skb after we wake a queue.
To avoid invalidating existing configurations, change
efx\_ethtool\_set\_ringparam() to fix up values that are too small rather
than returning -EINVAL.

net: Allow driver to limit number of GSO segments per skb
[ Upstream commit 30b678d844af3305cda5953467005cebb5d7b687 ]
A peer (or local user) may cause TCP to use a nominal MSS of as little
as 88 (actual MSS of 76 with timestamps). Given that we have a
sufficiently prodigious local sender and the peer ACKs quickly enough,
it is nevertheless possible to grow the window for such a connection
to the point that we will try to send just under 64K at once. This
results in a single skb that expands to 861 segments.
In some drivers with TSO support, such an skb will require hundreds of
DMA descriptors; a substantial fraction of a TX ring or even more than
a full ring. The TX queue selected for the skb may stall and trigger
the TX watchdog repeatedly (since the problem skb will be retried
after the TX reset). This particularly affects sfc, for which the
issue is designated as CVE-2012-3412.
Therefore:
1. Add the field net\_device::gso\_max\_segs holding the device-specific
limit.
2. In netif\_skb\_features(), if the number of segments is too high then
mask out GSO features to force fall back to software GSO.

# USN-1580-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

21 September 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers

that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit

this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](/security/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel

implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially

use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel.

([CVE-2012-3430](/security/CVE-2012-3430))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP

device driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine part of the

kernel's stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6547](/security/CVE-2012-6547))

A flaw was discovered in the requeuing of futexes in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact. ([CVE-2012-6647](/security/CVE-2012-6647))

A flaw was found in Linux kernel's validation of CIPSO (Common IP Security

Option) options set from userspace. A local user that can set a socket's

CIPSO options could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash

the system). ([CVE-2013-0310](/security/CVE-2013-0310))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1419-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1419.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1419.26)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1323)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A flaw was found in the way socket buffers (skb) requiring TSO (TCP

segment offloading) were handled by the sfc driver. If the skb did not fit
within the minimum-size of the transmission queue, the network card could
repeatedly reset itself. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2012-3412, Important)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the xacct\_add\_tsk() function in the

Linux kernel's taskstats subsystem. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to cause an information leak or a denial of service.
(CVE-2012-3510, Moderate)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs\_bnode\_read() function in the

HFS Plus (HFS+) file system implementation in the Linux kernel. A local
user able to mount a specially-crafted HFS+ file system image could use
this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2012-2319, Low)

* A flaw was found in the way the msg\_namelen variable in the rds\_recvmsg()

function of the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol
implementation was initialized. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to leak kernel stack memory to user-space. (CVE-2012-3430, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hutchings of Solarflare (tm) for reporting
CVE-2012-3412, and Alexander Peslyak for reporting CVE-2012-3510. The
CVE-2012-3430 issue was discovered by the Red Hat InfiniBand team.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The cpuid\_whitelist() function, masking the Enhanced Intel SpeedStep

(EST) flag from all guests, prevented the "cpuspeed" service from working
in the privileged Xen domain (dom0). CPU scaling was therefore not
possible. With this update, cpuid\_whitelist() is aware whether the domain
executing CPUID is privileged or not, and enables the EST flag for dom0.
(BZ#846125)

* If a delayed-allocation write was performed before quota was enabled,

the kernel displayed the following warning message:

WARNING: at fs/quota/dquot.c:988 dquot\_claim\_space+0x77/0x112()

This was because information about the delayed allocation was not recorded
in the quota structure. With this update, writes prior to enabling quota
are properly accounted for, and the message is not displayed. (BZ#847326)

* In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9, the DSCP (Differentiated Services Code

Point) netfilter module now supports mangling of the DSCP field.
(BZ#847327)

* Some subsystems clear the TIF\_SIGPENDING flag during error handling in

fork() paths. Previously, if the flag was cleared, the ERESTARTNOINTR error
code could be returned. The underlying source code has been modified so
that the error code is no longer returned. (BZ#847359)

* An unnecessary check for the RXCW.CW bit could cause the Intel e1000e NIC

(Network Interface Controller) to not work properly. The check has been
removed so that the Intel e1000e NIC works as expected. (BZ#852448)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel passed the replacement session

keyring to a child process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). ([CVE-2012-2745](/security/CVE-2012-2745))

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers

that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit

this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](/security/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel

implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially

use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel.

([CVE-2012-3430](/security/CVE-2012-3430))

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel's memory

subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a

denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-3511](/security/CVE-2012-3511))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-1578-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

21 September 2012

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers

that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit

this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](/security/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel

implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially

use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [linux-image-3.0.0-1216-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.0.0-1216.28](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.0.0-1216.28)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-07-31 13:27:49 UTC  ``` A peer (or local user) may cause TCP to use a nominal MSS of as little as 88 (actual MSS of 76 with timestamps).  Given that we have a sufficiently prodigious local sender and the peer ACKs quickly enough, it is nevertheless possible to grow the window for such a connection to the point that we will try to send just under 64K at once.  This results in a single skb that expands to 861 segments.  In some drivers with TSO support, such an skb will require hundreds of DMA descriptors; a substantial fraction of a TX ring or even more than a full ring.  The TX queue selected for the skb may stall and trigger the TX watchdog repeatedly (since the problem skb will be retried after the TX reset).  Upstream patch: <http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg206332.html>  References: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q3/171>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Ben Hutchings of Solarflare (tm) for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c3)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-03 12:35:31 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 845558](show_bug.cgi?id=845558 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2012-3412 kernel: sfc: potential remote denial of service through TCP MSS option [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c6)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-03 16:46:54 UTC  ``` Mitigation as recommended by Ben Hutchings ------------------------------------------  If all processes that may send on the sfc interface use Onload, or do not use TCP, the vulnerability does not exist.  The vulnerability can otherwise be avoided by making a temporary configuration change.  For an sfc interface named eth0, either:  a. Increase the TX queue size:        ethtool -G eth0 tx 4096    This can increase TX latency and memory usage.  or:  b. Disable TSO:        ethtool -K eth0 tso off    This can reduce TX throughput and/or increase CPU usage.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-02 17:11:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H, V2V and Agents for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2012:1324 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1324.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-02 17:45:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1323 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1323.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-09 10:28:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 EUS - Server Only  Via RHSA-2012:1347 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1347.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-16 14:46:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:1366 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1366.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-18 16:46:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2012:1375 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1375.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-10-23 18:11:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 EUS - Server Only  Via RHSA-2012:1401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1401.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=844714#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-11-06 18:06:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 EUS - Server Only  Via RHSA-2012:1430 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1430.html>   ``` |  |

An update that solves 7 vulnerabilities and has 84 fixes is now available. It includes one version update.

## Description:

The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP2 kernel has been updated to

3.0.51 which fixes various bugs and security issues.

It contains the following feature enhancements:

\* The cachefiles framework is now supported

(FATE#312793, bnc#782369). The userland utilities were

published seperately to support this feature.

\* The ipset netfilter modules are now supported

(FATE#313309) The ipset userland utility will be published

seperately to support this feature.

\* The tipc kernel module is now externally supported

(FATE#305033).

\* Hyper-V KVP IP injection was implemented

(FATE#314441). A seperate hyper-v package will be published

to support this feature.

\* Intel Lynx Point PCH chipset support was added.

(FATE#313409)

\*

Enable various md/raid10 and DASD enhancements.

(FATE#311379) These make it possible for RAID10 to cope

with DASD devices being slow for various reasons - the

affected device will be temporarily removed from the array.

Also added support for reshaping of RAID10 arrays.

mdadm changes will be published to support this

feature.

The following security issues have been fixed:

\* CVE-2012-5517: A race condition on hot adding memory

could be used by local attackers to crash the system during

hot adding new memory.

\* CVE-2012-4461: A flaw has been found in the way Linux

kernels KVM subsystem handled vcpu->arch.cr4

X86\_CR4\_OSXSAVE bit set upon guest enter. On hosts without

the XSAVE feature and using qemu userspace an unprivileged

local user could have used this flaw to crash the system.

\* CVE-2012-1601: The KVM implementation in the Linux

kernel allowed host OS users to cause a denial of service

(NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) by making a

KVM\_CREATE\_IRQCHIP ioctl call after a virtual CPU already

exists.

\* CVE-2012-2372: Attempting an rds connection from the

IP address of an IPoIB interface to itself causes a kernel

panic due to a BUG\_ON() being triggered. Making the test

less strict allows rds-ping to work without crashing the

machine. A local unprivileged user could use this flaw to

crash the sytem.

\* CVE-2012-4508: Dimitry Monakhov, one of the ext4

developers, has discovered a race involving asynchronous

I/O and fallocate which can lead to the exposure of stale

data --- that is, an extent which should have had the

"uninitialized" bit set indicating that its blocks have not

yet been written and thus contain data from a deleted file

will get exposed to anyone with read access to the file.

\* CVE-2012-3430: The rds\_recvmsg function in

net/rds/recv.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a

certain structure member, which allows local users to

obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack

memory via a (1) recvfrom or (2) recvmsg system call on an

RDS socket.

\* CVE-2012-3412: The sfc (aka Solarflare Solarstorm)

driver in the Linux kernel allowed remote attackers to

cause a denial of service (DMA descriptor consumption and

network-controller outage) via crafted TCP packets that

trigger a small MSS value.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
