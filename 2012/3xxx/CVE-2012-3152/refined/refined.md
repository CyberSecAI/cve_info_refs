Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2012-3152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `URLPARAMETER` function of Oracle Reports, which allows for arbitrary file browsing/downloading and planting files on the server. It is related to how Oracle Reports handles parameters in URLs, enabling an attacker to manipulate these parameters to perform malicious actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The `URLPARAMETER` vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server.
*  **Arbitrary File Access:** The vulnerability also enables an attacker to browse and download files from the server.
*  **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious JSP file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** The most significant impact is the ability to achieve remote code execution on the affected server by uploading and executing a malicious JSP file.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information by browsing and downloading arbitrary files from the server.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete system compromise if the attacker gains sufficient access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP:** The attack vector is primarily through HTTP requests by manipulating the URL parameters of the Oracle Reports servlet.
*   **Malicious URL Parameter Manipulation:** The exploit involves crafting specific URLs with malicious parameters to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Oracle Reports server.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication to the Oracle Reports application.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs knowledge of the target URL and the ability to host a malicious payload, typically a JSP file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit script is a Ruby script, designed to automate the exploitation process by enumerating keymaps and leveraging the `showenv` functionality to obtain a local path for payload uploading.
*   The vulnerability affects Oracle Reports Developer and is identified as impacting versions 11.1.1.4, 11.1.1.6, and 11.1.2.0.
*   The vulnerability is often mentioned alongside CVE-2012-3153, which involves the `PARSEQUERY` function, but this CVE specifically targets the `URLPARAMETER` function.
*   The provided Oracle advisory mentions that this vulnerability is part of a larger Critical Patch Update, and it affects Oracle Fusion Middleware.
