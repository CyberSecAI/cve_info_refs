Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2012-3315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of authentication required to access specific Java servlets within the management console of IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) and Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway (TFIMBG).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** Certain servlets that provide access to resources like federation metadata and web plugin configuration templates are accessible without requiring authentication. This lack of access control allows unauthorized retrieval of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the compromise of sensitive information used by TFIM/TFIMBG. Specifically, an attacker can obtain:
    *   Federation metadata.
    *   Web plugin configuration template.
*   **No Integrity or Availability Impact:**  The vulnerability does not affect the integrity of the system or the availability of resources. The impact is limited to the exposure of potentially sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the TFIM/TFIMBG management console interface.
*   **URL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the domain name of the TFIM/TFIMBG instance and the URLs of the vulnerable servlets.
*   **Federation UUID (for metadata):** If accessing federation metadata, the attacker needs to know the unique identifier (uuid) of a specific federation.
*   **Unauthenticated Requests:** The attacker can construct the necessary URL parameters and make unauthenticated requests to retrieve the resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the management console interface of the affected TFIM/TFIMBG instance over the network.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker must have specialized knowledge of the product, including the structure of the URLs and the required parameters to access the vulnerable servlets.
*   **Knowledge of the Target System:** The attacker needs to know the TFIM/TFIMBG domain name. For metadata access, the attacker requires a specific federation's UUID.
