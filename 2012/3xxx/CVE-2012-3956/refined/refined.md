Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a heap-use-after-free vulnerability within the `MediaStreamGraphThreadRunnable::Run()` function in Mozilla products like Firefox. This occurs when a media stream graph thread attempts to access freed memory, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The core issue is that the code attempts to use a memory location after it has been deallocated. This indicates a flaw in memory management and object lifecycle.
- Race Condition: The report mentions a race condition, where a free and read operation occur on different threads. This means that the vulnerability is triggered under concurrent or multi-threaded operations, where the timing of thread execution impacts whether or not a use-after-free is triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The most immediate impact is a denial-of-service attack through an application crash, due to accessing freed memory
- Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:  Though not stated directly, the potential for exploitation to achieve arbitrary code execution is acknowledged as possible based on the nature of the use-after-free vulnerability in the  description of MFSA-2012-58.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through malicious web content or by triggering a particular sequence of events in the affected application. An attacker needs to be able to trigger the use-after-free condition via manipulation of content related to a media stream graph.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control or manipulate the media content in a way that triggers the vulnerability. This may involve crafting a specific webpage, media file or manipulating API calls related to media.
- The attacker needs to induce the race condition in order to trigger the use-after-free. This may require certain system configuration, network conditions or specific execution conditions.
