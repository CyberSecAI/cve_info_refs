| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=839166#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-07-11 06:40:42 UTC  ```  From puppet labs: Puppet agents with certnames of IP addresses can be impersonated  This affects Puppet 2.6.16 and 2.7.17  If an authenticated host with a certname of an IP address changes IP addresses, and a second host assumes the first host's former IP address, the second host will be treated by the puppet master as the first one, giving the second host access to the first host's catalog. Note: This will not be fixed in Puppet versions prior to the forthcoming 3.x. Instead, with this announcement IP-based authentication in Puppet < 3.x is deprecated.  Resolved in Puppet 2.6.17, 2.7.18   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=839166#c1)  Kurt Seifried    2012-07-11 06:43:31 UTC  ``` Created puppet tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-17 [[bug 839168](show_bug.cgi?id=839168 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-3864 CVE-2012-3865 CVE-2012-3866 CVE-2012-3867 puppet various flaws [fedora-17]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=839166#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-07-11 06:47:56 UTC  ``` Created puppet tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-16 [[bug 839171](show_bug.cgi?id=839171 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-3864 CVE-2012-3865 CVE-2012-3867 puppet various flaws [fedora-16]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=839166#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2012-07-12 02:37:25 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <http://puppetlabs.com/security/cve/cve-2012-3408/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=839166#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-07-12 10:11:55 UTC  ``` This was only addressed in 2.7.  It was not really fixed, the change rather introduces deprecation warning:  <https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/commit/ab9150b>  No real fix is planned for this issue in puppet 2.x versions.  Hence no update is planned for Red Hat products that include puppet 2.x versions to address this problem.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=839166#c6)  Fedora Update System    2012-07-28 01:20:27 UTC  ``` puppet-2.7.18-1.fc17 has been pushed to the Fedora 17 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
