{
  "CVE-2012-3960": {
    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in `mozSpellChecker::SetCurrentDictionary` function of Mozilla Firefox. A specially crafted web page could cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mozSpellChecker::SetCurrentDictionary` function gets called, and then `mozHunspell::SetDictionary` is called, which in turn triggers a notification. An observer function then leads to the destruction of the `mozSpellChecker` object, but the `mozSpellChecker::SetCurrentDictionary` function attempts to dereference the already freed memory. The root cause is the race condition between the freeing of the object and dereferencing it.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious website could cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
     "Attack vectors": "A user visiting a specially crafted web page.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that the victim visits."
