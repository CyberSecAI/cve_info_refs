Please use CVE-2012-3409 for the ecryptfs mount.ecryptfs_private which

mount.ecryptfs_private?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1161332#c0)  Wolfgang Frisch   2020-01-20 12:30:04 UTC  ``` CVE-2012-3409  It was reported [1] that the private ecryptfs mount helper (/sbin/mount.ecryptfs_private), which is setuid-root, could allow an unprivileged local user to mount user-controlled ecryptfs shares on the local system.  Because the ecryptfs helper does not mount filesystems with the "nosuid" and "nodev" flags, it would be possible for a user to mount a filesystem containing setuid-root binaries and/or device files that could lead to the escalation of their privileges.  This could be done via a USB device, if the user had physical access to the system.  It was however also noted [2] that this may only affect version 86 and later, as the encrypted home source and destination mount points were hard-coded up until that version.  Forcing MS_NOSUID and MS_NODEV mount flags was added to version 99 (commits [3],[4])   [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/07/10/19> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/07/11/2> [3] <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/trunk/revision/705> [4] <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/trunk/revision/708>  References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-3409> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=841940> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-3409> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/07/12/1> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/07/11/23> <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/07/13/5> <http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2012/CVE-2012-3409.html> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3409> <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3409> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1161332#c1)  Wolfgang Frisch   2020-01-20 12:30:53 UTC  ``` No supported SUSE distribution is affected by this issue. ``` |  |

There are two separate issues here. The first is with the attack vector
described above.

An attacker could trivially craft a lower encrypted filesystem on a USB
drive. It would be automatically mounted in most distros these
days and the mount flags would most likely contain MS_NOSUID. However,
setuid and setgid bits in the USB drive's filesystem would still be
honored if a setuid-root mount.ecryptfs_private was available on the
system because it was not forcing the MS_NOSUID mount flag on the mounts
that it set up.

If we distill that down a little more, it means that it is possible to
mount eCryptfs, *without* MS_NOSUID, on top of a filesystem that is
mounted with MS_NOSUID and eCryptfs will happily honor the setuid and
setgid bits at its layer. I tend to lean towards that being a
non-security, but serious, filesystem stacking bug but I could be
convinced otherwise. It would definitely be an administrator error, but
I don't know what behavior an admin should expect in this situation. Any
thoughts?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=841940#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-07-20 15:25:56 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the private ecryptfs mount helper (/sbin/mount.ecryptfs_private), which is setuid-root, could allow an unprivileged local user to mount user-controlled ecryptfs shares on the local system.  Because the ecryptfs helper does not mount filesystems with the "nosuid" and "nodev" flags, it would be possible for a user to mount a filesystem containing setuid-root binaries and/or device files that could lead to the escalation of their privileges.  This could be done via a USB device, if the user had physical access to the system.  It was however also noted [2] that this may only affect version 86 and later, as the encrypted home source and destination mount points were hard-coded up until that version.  Forcing MS_NOSUID and MS_NODEV mount flags was added to version 99 (commits [3],[4])   [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/07/10/19> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/07/11/2> [3] <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/trunk/revision/705> [4] <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ecryptfs/ecryptfs/trunk/revision/708>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=841940#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-07-20 15:30:39 UTC  ``` I also forgot to note that on Fedora and RHEL, you need to be part of the ecryptfs group to even use the ecryptfs filesystems/utilities, which lowers the attack surface considerably.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=841940#c3)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-07-24 04:53:07 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not Vulnerable. This issue does not affect the version of ecryptfs-utils as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=841940#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-07-24 04:53:57 UTC  ``` Created ecryptfs-utils tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 842512](show_bug.cgi?id=842512 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-3409 ecryptfs-utils: suid helper does not restrict mounting filesystems with nosuid,nodev leading to possible privilege escalation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=841940#c5)  Fedora Update System    2012-08-03 11:27:42 UTC  ``` ecryptfs-utils-99-1.fc17 has been pushed to the Fedora 17 stable repository.

Yeah, the other thing I'd add is that in order to perform this attack
(create a filesystem on a USB drive, have physical access to the
system, plug in the USB drive), the attacking user could just as
easily drop their favorite LiveISO on that same USB drive, reboot the
system, and mount the hard drive with root access.  I do see the
difference, in that the current issue allows for a live attack against
a running system, as opposed to an offline attack against a system at
rest.

In any case, I have tested the fixes and just released
ecryptfs-utils-99 which contains the no-set-uid fixes from Sebastian
Krahmer and Tyler Hicks (thanks!).  We'll be following that release
with another one shortly, that fixes a regression (race condition in a
bit of a corner-case, when using pam_ecryptfs and encrypted file names
on a system where ecryptfs is built as a kernel module).

Cheers,

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
