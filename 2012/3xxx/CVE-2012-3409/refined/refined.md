{
  "CVE-2012-3409": {
    "description": "ecryptfs-utils: suid helper does not restrict mounting filesystems with nosuid,nodev which creates a possible privilege escalation",
    "root_cause": "The `mount.ecryptfs_private` helper, which has setuid-root permissions, does not enforce the `nosuid` and `nodev` mount flags when mounting ecryptfs filesystems.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The setuid-root `mount.ecryptfs_private` helper allows mounting of filesystems without restricting the use of setuid binaries or device files."
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation is possible. A local unprivileged user can mount a crafted filesystem (e.g., via a USB drive) containing setuid-root binaries or device files, which, when executed, grant them elevated privileges.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A local attacker with physical access can insert a USB drive containing a crafted filesystem with setuid-root binaries or device files",
        "An attacker can mount a lower encrypted filesystem which, when combined with the lack of MS_NOSUID on the ecryptfs mount, allows the setuid bits to be honored."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "A local, unprivileged user with physical access to the system and the ability to insert a USB drive or other mountable media is required."
