```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - SQL Injection: Unsanitized user input in the invoice search functionality allows injection of arbitrary SQL commands through the `invoice_number` and `tags` parameters.
    - Persistent XSS: Lack of proper input validation in the user account creation/editing allows injection of malicious script code in the `first_name` and `last_name` fields.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - SQL Injection: Improper input sanitization in the invoice search module.
    - Persistent XSS: Lack of input validation when adding or editing user accounts.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - SQL Injection: Database and application compromise, including unauthorized access and manipulation of data.
    - Persistent XSS: Session hijacking of administrative accounts and persistent manipulation of application context.
- Attack vectors:
    - SQL Injection: Sending malicious POST requests to the `invoice_search` module with crafted `invoice_number` or `tags` parameters.
    - Persistent XSS: Injecting malicious script code into the `first_name` or `last_name` fields via the user account creation/editing form.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - SQL Injection: Remote attacker without authentication.
    - Persistent XSS: Remote attacker with low user privileges capable of creating or editing user accounts.
