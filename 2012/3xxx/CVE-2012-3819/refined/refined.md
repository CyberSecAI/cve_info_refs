The provided content relates to CVE-2012-3819.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the web server's improper handling of excessively long requested URIs in GET requests. The server copies the requested URI into memory, including the stack. When the URI is excessively large, it exhausts the available stack space for the process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack exhaustion due to unbounded copying of the requested URI.
- Lack of input validation or size checks on the requested URI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The server crashes due to a stack overflow exception, rendering it unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP GET request with an extremely long URI.
- The vulnerability can be triggered with a continuous string of repeating characters as the URI if the request does not contain the "\\n\\n" sequence.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the vulnerable server (e.g., using netcat).
- No authentication or special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
