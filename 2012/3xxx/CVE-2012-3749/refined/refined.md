Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2012-3749:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An information disclosure issue existed in the handling of APIs related to kernel extensions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is related to an information disclosure in the handling of kernel extension APIs. Specifically, responses containing an `OSBundleMachOHeaders` key may have included kernel addresses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Compromised applications may be able to determine addresses in the kernel. This information could aid in bypassing address space layout randomization (ASLR) protection, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
A maliciously crafted or compromised application could exploit this vulnerability by requesting the vulnerable API, which would leak kernel addresses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to have a malicious application running on the device. This application would need to make use of the vulnerable API to extract the kernel addresses.
