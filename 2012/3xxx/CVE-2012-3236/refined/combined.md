# USN-1559-1: GIMP vulnerabilities

10 September 2012

GIMP could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [gimp](/security/cves?package=gimp) - The GNU Image Manipulation Program

## Details

Joseph Sheridan discovered that GIMP incorrectly handled certain malformed

headers in FIT files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted FIT image file, an attacker could cause GIMP to crash.

([CVE-2012-3236](/security/CVE-2012-3236))

Murray McAllister discovered that GIMP incorrectly handled malformed KiSS

palette files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted KiSS

palette file, an attacker could cause GIMP to crash, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2012-3403](/security/CVE-2012-3403))

Matthias Weckbecker discovered that GIMP incorrectly handled malformed GIF

image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted GIF

image file, an attacker could cause GIMP to crash, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the user's privileges. ([CVE-2012-3481](/security/CVE-2012-3481))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=676804#c0)  joe    2012-05-25 09:06:45 UTC  ``` There is a file handling DoS in GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) for the  'fit' file format affecting all versions (Windows and Linux) up to 2.8.0. A file  in the fit format with a malformed 'XTENSION' header will cause a crash in the  GIMP program. The flaw is triggered by opening a crafted 'fit' file or allowing the file explorer dialog to preview the file.  A file in the fit format starting as follows will trigger the crash: XTENSIONaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaHEADER2...  The vulnerable code is in the fits-io.c lines where the program attempts to copy from a null pointer:   {    fdat = fits_decode_card (fits_search_card (hdr, "XTENSION"), typ_fstring);    strcpy (hdulist->xtension, fdat->fstring);  } ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=676804#c1)  Michael Natterer    2012-05-25 09:34:12 UTC  ``` Can you attach such a file, a small one please? ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=676804#c2)  joe    2012-05-25 09:45:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 214926](attachment.cgi?id=214926 "vulnerable fit file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=214926&action=edit "vulnerable fit file") vulnerable fit file  vulnerable fit file attached. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=676804#c3)  joe    2012-05-28 14:19:32 UTC  ``` Hi guys,  Do you plan to release a fix for this issue - if so what version and when?

Summary
=======

There is a file handling DoS in GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) for
the 'fit' file format affecting all versions (Windows and Linux) up to and
including 2.8.0. A file in the fit format with a malformed 'XTENSION' header
will cause a crash in the GIMP program.

CVE number: CVE-2012-3236
Vendor Homepage: http://www.gimp.org/
Date reported to vendor: 25/05/2012
Found by Joseph Sheridan:
href="http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/joseph-sheridan.html

This advisory is posted at:
http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/FIT-file-handling-DoS.html

PoC file is available here:
http://www.reactionpenetrationtesting.co.uk/vuln.fit
https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb-bin-sploits/-/raw/main/bin-sploits/19482.fit

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following products are known to be affected by this vulnerability:

* GIMP <= 2.8.0 (Windows or Linux builds)

Products Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------
* GIMP 2.8.1

Details
=======

There is a file handling DoS in GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) for
the 'fit' file format affecting all versions (Windows and Linux) up to 2.8.0.
A file in the fit format with a malformed 'XTENSION' header will cause a crash
in the GIMP program. The flaw is triggered by opening a crafted 'fit' file or
allowing the file explorer dialog to preview the file.

A file in the fit format starting as follows will trigger the crash:
XTENSIONaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaHEADER2...

The vulnerable code is in the fits-io.c lines where the program attempts to
copy from a null pointer:

{
fdat = fits_decode_card (fits_search_card (hdr, "XTENSION"), typ_fstring);
strcpy (hdulist->xtension, fdat->fstring);
}

This code can be patched by changing it to the following (as GIMP 2.8.1):

fdat = fits_decode_card (fits_search_card (hdr, "XTENSION"), typ_fstring);
if(fdat != NULL) {
strcpy (hdulist->xtension, fdat->fstring);
} else {
strcpy (errmsg, "No valid XTENSION header found.");
goto err_return;
}

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in an application
crash and denial of service.

Solution
===========
The GIMP team have provided an update for this issue (release 2.8.1).

Workarounds
===========

The fits-io.c file can be patched as above.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
