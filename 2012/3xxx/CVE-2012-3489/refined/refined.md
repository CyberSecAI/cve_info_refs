{
  "CVE-2012-3489": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `xml_parse()` routine in PostgreSQL would attempt to fetch external files or URLs to resolve DTD and entity references in an XML value.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "An XML External Entities (XXE) vulnerability was present, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary system files or URLs that are accessible to the database server user.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged database user can read arbitrary system files accessible with the privileges of the user running the PostgreSQL server. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive data, such as configuration files.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this by issuing a specially crafted SQL query to the PostgreSQL server containing XML data with external entity references.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated database user, but does not need any elevated privileges beyond a normal database user."
