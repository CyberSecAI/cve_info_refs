## Analysis of CVE-2012-3450

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance**

The provided content includes a detailed description of a parsing bug in PHP PDO prepared statements, which matches the CVE description. It includes:

*   **Affected Product:** PHP
*   **Affected Component:** PDO - PHP Data Objects
*   **Affected Versions:** <= 5.4.3
*   **Description:** Inconsistent parsing of PHP PDO prepared statements leading to access violations and DoS. This matches the CVE description of a parsing bug in PHP PDO prepared statements that may lead to access violations.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability**
The root cause lies in the inconsistent parsing logic of PHP PDO prepared statements. Specifically:

*   **Erroneous state machine design:** The state machine responsible for parsing PDO statements is poorly designed, leading to inconsistent checks of the supplied SQL query.
*   **Lack of proper termination:** Under specific conditions, the parser fails to terminate properly, leading to the entire stack being cycled through without reaching the null terminator.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**

*   **Inconsistent parsing:** The state machine's inability to consistently check the supplied SQL queries.
*   **Stack cycling/out-of-bounds access:** The parser can iterate beyond the end of the query string leading to out-of-bounds access and cycling through the stack.
*   **Potential for parameter rebinding:** In specific, though unlikely scenarios, attacker-controlled parameter rebinding could be achieved.

**4. Impact of exploitation**

*   **Access violations:** Due to the parser iterating beyond the supplied query string, it can access stack data, resulting in access violations and a crash.
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The access violation or stack cycling behavior can cause a denial-of-service.
*   **Potential parameter rebinding:** While unlikely to occur in isolation, this could potentially lead to parameter rebinding, allowing more control over the SQL queries.

**5. Attack vectors**

*   **SQL injection:** The attacker needs to be able to control parts of the SQL query string before it is prepared using `stm->prepare()`.
*   **Stack cycling via manipulated SQL:** Attackers manipulate the main SQL query string to force the PDO parser to cycle through the stack.
*   **Fake parameter bindings:** Inject manipulated SQL strings with fake parameter bindings into the stack.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position**

*   **User-controlled query input:** The attacker needs to be able to control part of the SQL query string before it's prepared by the PDO layer. This often happens when user input is directly inserted into an SQL query, a common coding flaw.
*   **Knowledge of existing bindings (for parameter rebinding):** If the goal is parameter rebinding, the attacker needs to know the original binding names and the number of bound parameters.
*   **Unlikely scenario for parameter rebinding:** The stack cycling required for parameter rebinding is complex and unlikely to occur under normal circumstances. However, it may be used in conjunction with other attacks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text explicitly states that `mysql_real_escape()` is **NOT** a mitigation for this vulnerability.
*   The advisory includes details such as a test script and a patch, suggesting a more advanced vulnerability than the official CVE description might imply.
*   The vulnerability was discovered in PHP 5.3.8, verified in 5.3.0, 5.3.10 and 5.4.0 but wasn't fixed until after 5.4.3
