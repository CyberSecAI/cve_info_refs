# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : xen
Vulnerability  : Denial of Service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3432 CVE-2012-3433
Debian Bug     : 683279

Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen,
the popular virtualization software. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2012-3432

 Guest mode unprivileged code, which has been granted the privilege to
 access MMIO regions, may leverage that access to crash the whole guest.
 Since this be used to crash a client from within, this vulnerability is
 consider with low impact.

CVE-2012-3433

 A guest kernel can cause the host to become unresponsive for a period
 of time, potentially leading to a DoS. Since an attacker with full
 control in the guest can impact on the host, this vulnerability is
 consider with high impact.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

That would technically make the above statement > incompatible with the GPL.  IMNAL but this is just an alternative, less strict, MIT license for this file, same as the x86 counterpart (arch/x86/include/asm/xen/hypercall.h). The intent is to allow other operating systems, the BSDs for example, to be able to use it if they want to. Actually, given that the ARM implementation is not inline, I should remember to add this copyright header to the assembly source file too.  _______________________________________________ Xen-devel mailing list Xen-devel@xxxxxxxxxxxxx <http://lists.xen.org/xen-devel>   ```    ---    * **References**:   + **[[Xen-devel] [PATCH 00/24] Introduce Xen support on ARM](msg01480.html)**     - *From:* Stefano Stabellini   + **[[Xen-devel] [PATCH 02/24] xen/arm: hypercalls](msg01483.html)**     - *From:* Stefano Stabellini   + **[Re: [Xen-devel] [PATCH 02/24] xen/arm: hypercalls](msg01522.html)**     - *From:* Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk   + **[Re: [Xen-devel] [PATCH 02/24] xen/arm: hypercalls](msg01595.html)**     - *From:* Ian Campbell   + **[Re: [Xen-devel] [PATCH 02/24] xen/arm: hypercalls](msg01634.html)**     - *From:* Stefano Stabellini   + **[Re: [Xen-devel] [PATCH 02/24] xen/arm: hypercalls](msg01641.html)**     - *From:* Russell King - ARM Linux   * Prev by Date:   **[Re: [Xen-devel] [PATCH 13/24] xen/arm: get privilege status](msg01648.html)** * Next by Date:   **[[Xen-devel] Xen Security Advisory 10 (CVE-2012-3432) - HVM user mode MMIO emul DoS](msg01650.html)** * Previous by thread:   **[Re: [Xen-devel] [PATCH 02/24] xen/arm: hypercalls](msg01641.html)** * Next by thread:   **[Re: [Xen-devel] [PATCH 02/24] xen/arm: hypercalls](msg01651.html)** * Index(es):   + [**Date**](index.html#01649)   + [**Thread**](threads.html#01649) |
