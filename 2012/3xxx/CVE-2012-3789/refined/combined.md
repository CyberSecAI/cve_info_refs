For example, merkle\_hash([a, b, c]) and merkle\_hash([a, b, c, c]) yield the same result. This is because, at every iteration, the Merkle hash function pads its intermediate list of hashes with the last hash if the list is of odd length, in order to make it of even length.And so, the Merkle root function can be effectively preimaged by changing the input so that one of the intermediate lists is of even length with the last two elements equal (where originally it was of odd length with a last element equal to the earlier mentioned two). As was later noted, this extends to any input length that is not a power of two: merkle\_hash([a, b, c, d, e, f]) == merkle\_hash([a, b, c, d, e, f, e, f]). Note that to maintain the same root hash, the only flexibility that exists is duplication of elements.As a result, two blocks can easily be created that have the same block hash, though one can be valid and the other invalid, by duplicating one or more of the transactions in a way that maintains the Merkle root hash. Duplicating any transaction will make the block invalid, since the block double spends a certain past transaction output.An unpatched Bitcoin installation can be permanently wedged at its current highest block using this and the fact that Bitcoin caches orphan blocks in a disk-backed database. To do so, the attacker must send it a valid block (that will eventually make it into the blockchain) made invalid by duplicating one of the transactions in a way that preserves the Merkle root. The attacker doesn't even need to mine their own block - instead, they can listen for a block, then mutate it in this way, and pass it on to their peers.Once the victim receives this invalid block, they will cache it on disk, attempt to process it, and reject it as invalid. Re-requestingthe block will not be even attempted since Bitcoin believes that it already has the block, since it has one with the same hash. Bitcoin eventually displays the "WARNING: Displayed transactions may not be correct!  You may need to upgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade." warning when the blockchain extends further beyond the received invalid block.The problem was fixed by Gavin Andresen in Bitcoin commit be8651d [1] by rejecting blocks with duplicate transactions in CheckBlock, preventing them from being cached at all.Cheers,Forrest Voight<http://forre.st/>[1]: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/be8651dde7b59e50e8c443da71c706667803d06d> | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   1J1zegkNSbwX4smvTdoHSanUfwvXFeuV23 | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

It is bugs like this that make me think that having several different implementations of the Bitcoin protocol is a good idea. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   How often do you get the chance to work on a potentially world-changing project? | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

An attacker could have used this exploit against a number of large miners (say about 40% or so) and exchanges to pull off any number of double-spend attacks until the miners noticed they had been forked and fixed their bitcoind. That is, the attacker could easily hijack as much of the miners has he wanted for his own purposes **including phony 6+ confirmation transactions**. On a more subtle level, the attacker could target certain blocks they wanted orphans by performing this attack on a majority of miners with the "tip" block he wanted orphaned.This vulnerability is also the reason why Eloipool (the software behind Eligius, EclipseMC, TripleMining, and other pools) has attempted to produce blocks with only transaction counts that are powers of two; such blocks cannot be used for an attack even against vulnerable clients. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   Donate: (PM me)My projects: [Bitcoin Knots](http://bitcoinknots.org/), [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/), [BFGMiner](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=626361), [Eloipool (pool software)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=61731.0), [Tonal Bitcoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Tonal_Bitcoin), and [BitGit (Bitcoin code directory)](http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/) | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Now that people are upgrading, is there is a system in place to detect if someone tries this attack on the network? In other words, even though many old attacks won't work, do devs/testers actively scan the network to detect bogus packets which attempt to implement these exploits. Sort of having a Bitcoin IDS CheesyFor example, perhaps an advanced version of something like this: <http://blockchain.info/strange-transactions> | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   "The difference between a castle and a prison is only a question of who holds the keys." | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Thanks to Sergio Lernerfor finding and responsibly reporting the problem. (CVE-2012-3789)Optimized the process of checking transaction signatures, tospeed up processing of new block messages and make propagatingblocks across the network faster.Fixed an obscure bug that could cause the bitcoin process to getstuck on an invalid block-chain, if the invalid chain washundreds of blocks long.Bitcoin-Qt no longer automatically selects the first addressin the address book (Issue #1384).Fixed minimize-to-dock behavior of Bitcon-Qt on the Mac.Added a block checkpoint at block 185,333 to speed up initialblockchain download.Thanks to everybody who contributed to this release:====================================================Chris MooreChristian von RoquesFordyGavin AndresenJeff GarzikLuke DashjrMatt CoralloMichael HendricksPeter ToddPhilip KaufmannPieter WuilleR E BroadleySergio LernerWladimir J. van der Laan | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   How often do you get the chance to work on a potentially world-changing project? | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

Afterall, this file \_is\_ brand new. Of course, in this case, you already knew it, so the warnings were just in the way. I'd expect in most cases that would be quite useful in shielding your system from new unknown threats. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

After a couple of minutes, the count **increased** to ~1225. Note 3: I was only able to connect to 8 nodes on 0.6.3 even though the bitcoin.conf hasn't changed and I normally connect to +100 nodes. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  |  ---   [[INFO] Bitcoin Exchanges: Transparency Data or Lack Thereof](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=93386)[[INFO] Open Source Trading Platforms](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=87836.0) | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

## CVE-2010-5140

Summary: Never confirming transactions
Fix Deployment: 100%

```

| Affected | | Fix |

| bitcoindwxBitcoin | \* - 0.3.12 | 0.3.13 |

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.
