{
  "cve": "CVE-2012-3355",
  "description": "The context plugin in Rhythmbox creates a temporary directory in an insecure manner, allowing a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via a symlink attack on a temporary HTML template file in the /tmp/context directory. The affected files are AlbumTab.py, ArtistTab.py, LinksTab.py, and LyricsTab.py.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Rhythmbox context plugin uses a hardcoded, insecure temporary directory (/tmp/context) for storing and loading HTML template files. This allows for a symlink attack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of temporary directory",
      "Hardcoded path",
      "Symlink vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Rhythmbox.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Local exploitation via symlink attack on a template file"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system and the ability to create symlinks in /tmp/context."
  },
    "affected_products": [
    "GNOME Rhythmbox 0.13.3 and earlier",
    "Ubuntu 12.04",
    "Ubuntu 11.10",
    "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6",
     "Fedora 16",
    "Fedora 17"
   ],
  "solution": "The vulnerability was addressed by using `tempfile.mkdtemp` to securely create a unique temporary directory instead of a hardcoded one. Additionally, the module_directory parameter was removed in a later fix."
