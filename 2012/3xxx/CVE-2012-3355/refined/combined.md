| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=678661#c0)  Josselin Mouette    2012-06-23 08:42:44 UTC  ``` Original report by Hans Spaans: <http://bugs.debian.org/616673>  The context plugin has the same terrible programming mistake all over:          self.album_template = Template (filename = self.path,                                         module_directory = '/tmp/context')  The module_directory parameter being a place for Python modules, it is very easy for another user to usurp it and put other files in place, running code in your stead. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=678661#c1)  Andreas Henriksson    2012-07-05 15:22:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 218103](attachment.cgi?id=218103 "use mkdtemp to securely create temp dir") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=218103&action=edit "use mkdtemp to securely create temp dir") [[review]](review?bug=678661&attachment=218103) use mkdtemp to securely create temp dir  This patch uses tempfile.mkdtemp to securely create a unique temporary directory. (An alternative could also be to simply drop all "module_directory" and let the mako template engine regenerate everything every time....) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=678661#c2)  James Strandboge    2012-07-09 15:47:23 UTC  ``` Part of the problem with the original implementation is that it doesn't clean up itself and will reuse /tmp/context/... unconditionally so another user or subverted process could write here and execute arbitrary code (as Josselin said). Obviously that is bad and this patch addresses that.  A concern I initially had with the proposed patch is if rhythmbox could be made to reload the imported modules. Since the .py and .pyc persist for the life of the rhythmbox process, a subverted user process could notice the rb-context-* directory in /tmp and change the modules out from underneath a running rhythmbox. Fortunately, based on upstream python documentation[1][2] this is not an issue. It states:  "Note: For efficiency reasons, each module is only imported once per interpreter session. Therefore, if you change your modules, you must restart the interpreter â or, if itâs just one module you want to test interactively, use reload(), e.g. reload(modulename)."  I verified the rhymthbox code and it does not use reload(module) (it does use self.reload, but this is different). I also tested this behavior by removing the .py* files while rhythmbox was running, and I could not make rhythmbox regenerate them until after restart.  As such, this patch seems sufficient to close the security vulnerability. That said, I'm not particularly fond of how the plugin auto-generates python modules in a temporary directory and later imports them. Going forward perhaps it would be better to use your alternative of dropping the module_directory altogether.  [1]<http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html> [2]<http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/modules.html> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=678661#c3)  Vincent Untz    2012-07-23 10:08:19 UTC  ``` Can we get this patch in? Or is there any issue with it? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=678661#c4)  James Strandboge    2012-07-23 16:14:04 UTC  ``` FYI, I pushed this out as a distro patch in Ubuntu with no reported issues. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=678661#c5)  Jonathan Matthew    2012-07-24 10:46:30 UTC  ``` I don't see much point in using the module_directory thing. If it turns out that it's too slow without the cache, I'd prefer to use the XDG cache dir.  I briefly tested it without the module_directory setting and it seems to work fine, so I removed it in commit [01a829f](https://git.gnome.org/browse/rhythmbox/commit/?id=01a829f). ``` |  |

Sorry for not replying earlier.
This terrible newbie mistake is probably a local privilege escalation
vulnerability.

Squeeze is affected.

Since this is a security fix that's been sitting around for a bit, I'm going to
go ahead and upload the attached NMU diff.  There are two possible patches
available to resolve this issue.  The initial one done by Ubuntu and the
upstream one.  Since the upstream patch also had some functional changes, the
NMU is based on the Ubuntu patch (both resolved the security issue) to keep
the changes to the minimum.

For the maintainers, of course I'm glad to have you do it the other way if you
prefer, but I think it's better to at least get a security fix in the archive
than not.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.7) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

# USN-1503-1: Rhythmbox vulnerability

11 July 2012

Rhythmbox could be made to run programs as your login when using the Context
plugin.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [rhythmbox](/security/cves?package=rhythmbox) - music player and organizer for GNOME

## Details

Hans Spaans discovered that the Context plugin in Rhythmbox created a

temporary directory in an insecure manner. A local attacker could exploit

this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. The

Context plugin is disabled by default in Ubuntu.

After a standard system update you need to restart Rhythmbox to make all

the necessary changes.

Subject: CVE 2011-* Request -- rhythmbox (context plug-in): Insecure temporary
 directory use by loading template files for 'Album', 'Lyrics', and 'Artist'
 tabs

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   An insecure temporary directory use flaw was found in the way Rhythmbox, an integrated music
management application based on the powerful GStreamer media framework, performed loading of HTML
template files, used for rendering of 'Album', 'Lyrics', and 'Artist' tabs. Previously the
'/tmp/context' directory has been searched as module directory when loading the HTML template files.
A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks (possibly leading to
attacker's ability to execute arbitrary HTML template file in the context of user running the
rhythmbox executable).

Upstream bug report:
[1] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678661>

References:
[2] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=616673>
[3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=835076>

Please note the [2] bug has been reported / opened on:
"Date: Sun, 06 Mar 2011 14:58:46 +0100" yet, so this should
get a CVE-2011-* identifier. Could you allocate one?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

### [jdstrand](https://launchpad.net/~jdstrand)

does not affect 11.04 and earlier
Context plugin not enabled by default in Ubuntu
upstream has not settled on a patch, but after analyzing the
proposed patch, it should address the issue sufficiently (see comment #2
from the upstream bug)

# USN-1503-1: Rhythmbox vulnerability

11 July 2012

Rhythmbox could be made to run programs as your login when using the Context
plugin.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [rhythmbox](/security/cves?package=rhythmbox) - music player and organizer for GNOME

## Details

Hans Spaans discovered that the Context plugin in Rhythmbox created a

temporary directory in an insecure manner. A local attacker could exploit

this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. The

Context plugin is disabled by default in Ubuntu.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [rhythmbox-plugins](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/rhythmbox)
  -
  [2.96-0ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/rhythmbox/2.96-0ubuntu4.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [rhythmbox-plugins](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/rhythmbox)
  -
  [2.90.1~20110908-0ubuntu1.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/rhythmbox/2.90.1~20110908-0ubuntu1.4)

After a standard system update you need to restart Rhythmbox to make all

the necessary changes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=835076#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-06-25 13:30:40 UTC  ``` An insecure temporary directory use flaw was found in the way Rhythmbox, an integrated music management application based on the powerful GStreamer media framework, performed loading of HTML template files, used for rendering of 'Album', 'Lyrics', and 'Artist' tabs. Previously the '/tmp/context' directory has been searched as module directory when loading the HTML template files. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link attacks (possibly leading to attacker's ability to execute arbitrary HTML template file in the context of user running the rhythmbox executable).
