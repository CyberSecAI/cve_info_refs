```
Root cause of vulnerability:
- An insecure call to unserialize in the help system, specifically in the view_help.php file, due to a missing signature (HMAC) for a parameter.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure deserialization

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution.

Attack vectors:
- By exploiting the missing signature, an attacker can pass a malicious serialized object which, when unserialized, executes arbitrary code.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Requires a valid backend user login or multiple successful cross-site request forgery attacks.
