| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=849926#c0)  Martin Wilck    2012-08-21 09:06:58 UTC  ``` Description of problem: When opening certain capture files, wireshark hangs forever in an endless loop.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): wireshark-1.6.8-1.fc16.x86_64  I compiled wireshark 1.8.2 from source and did not see this problem any more.  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. open capture file with wireshark    Actual results: hangs after reading ~25% of the data  Expected results: opens file successfully  Additional info:

However, vanilla wireshark 1.8.2 also loops indefinitely.  Hmm, you're right - strange, I'd bet I was able to open it with 1.8.2 last week.  The problem seems to be that wireshark wrongly assumes this to be "drda" traffic (because of the client port 676??). It hangs while trying to reassemble this traffic.   when started with   tshark -r test.cap.gz  tshark also hangs at frame #28881. but tshark can be told how to decode the traffic.   tshark -d tcp.port==2049,rpc -r test.cap.gz  works fine. Unfortunately I have found no option to tell the GUI tool how to decode certain ports.  > I hope the capture file does not contain any sensitive data as I am going to > send it upstream.  I captured only frame headers, so it should be fine. However next time please wait for an answer before doing this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=849926#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-08-29 15:15:19 UTC  ``` Thank you for your report, Martin.
