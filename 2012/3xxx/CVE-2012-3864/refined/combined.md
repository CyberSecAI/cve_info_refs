Add Selector terminus for file\_content/file\_metadata

```
This terminus is now the default, and encapsulates the behavior that was
previously in the IndirectionHooks. That is, we dynamically select the
terminus to use for a file request based on the key. However, for the
puppet master, we instead explicitly always use the FileServer terminus,
so that *all* requests for files from the master will go through
the file server. This ensures that we will never accidentally
serve local files on the puppet master.
```

Package        : puppet
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3864 CVE-2012-3865 CVE-2012-3866 CVE-2012-3867

Several security vulnerabilities have been found in Puppet, a
centralized configuration management:

CVE-2012-3864

   Authenticated clients could read arbitrary files on the puppet master.

CVE-2012-3865

   Authenticated clients could delete arbitrary files on the puppet master.

CVE-2012-3866

   The report of the most recent Puppet run was stored with world-
   readable permissions, resulting in information disclosure.

CVE-2012-3867

   Agent hostnames were insufficiently validated.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Add Selector terminus for file\_content/file\_metadata

```
This terminus is now the default, and encapsulates the behavior that was
previously in the IndirectionHooks. That is, we dynamically select the
terminus to use for a file request based on the key. However, for the
puppet master, we instead explicitly always use the FileServer terminus,
so that *all* requests for files from the master will go through
the file server. This ensures that we will never accidentally
serve local files on the puppet master.

# USN-1506-1: Puppet vulnerabilities

12 July 2012

Several security issues were fixed in Puppet.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [puppet](/security/cves?package=puppet) - Centralized configuration management

## Details

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled certain HTTP GET

requests. An attacker could use this flaw with a valid client certificate

to retrieve arbitrary files from the Puppet primary server.

([CVE-2012-3864](/security/CVE-2012-3864))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled Delete requests. If a

Puppet primary server were reconfigured to allow the "Delete" method, an

attacker on an authenticated host could use this flaw to delete arbitrary

files from the Puppet server, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2012-3865](/security/CVE-2012-3865))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly set file permissions on the

last\_run\_report.yaml file. An attacker could use this flaw to access

sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.10 and Ubuntu

12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-3866](/security/CVE-2012-3866))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled agent certificate names.

An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate

and trick an administrator into signing a certificate that can then be used

to machine-in-the-middle agent nodes. ([CVE-2012-3867](/security/CVE-2012-3867))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [puppet-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet)
  -
  [2.7.11-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet/2.7.11-1ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [puppet-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet)
  -
  [2.7.1-1ubuntu3.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet/2.7.1-1ubuntu3.7)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [puppet-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet)
  -
  [2.6.4-2ubuntu2.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet/2.6.4-2ubuntu2.10)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

  -
  [0.25.4-2ubuntu6.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/puppet/0.25.4-2ubuntu6.8)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
