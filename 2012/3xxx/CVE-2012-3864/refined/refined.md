Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2012-3864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Puppet handled HTTP GET requests when serving files. Specifically, it did not properly restrict access, allowing authenticated clients to request and receive the contents of arbitrary files on the Puppet master server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The core issue is that a flaw in Puppet allowed authenticated clients to read files on the Puppet master that they shouldn't have access to.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The vulnerability was a result of a lack of proper access controls on file serving functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read the contents of any file on the Puppet master server that the puppet master has read access to. This could expose sensitive configuration data, credentials, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is performed over the network by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the Puppet master server.
- **Authenticated Client Required**: A valid client certificate and private key are required to make the malicious requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Puppet Client Credentials:** The attacker must possess a valid client certificate and the corresponding private key to authenticate with the Puppet master.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Puppet master over the network.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability existed in Puppet versions 2.6.16 and 2.7.17, and was resolved in versions 2.6.17 and 2.7.18.
- Patches for this vulnerability involved changes to how file serving requests were handled, specifically by implementing a "Selector" terminus, which restricts the behavior of file serving on the puppet master.
