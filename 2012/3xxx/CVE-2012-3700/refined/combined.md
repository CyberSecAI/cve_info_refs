## Safari 6.0.1

**Note**: For OS X Mountain Lion systems, Safari 6.0.1 is included with OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2.

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted downloaded HTML document may lead to the disclosure of local file content

  Description: In OS X Mountain Lion HTML files were removed from the unsafe type list. Quarantined HTML documents are opened in a safe mode that prevents accessing other local or remote resources. A logic error in Safari's handling of the Quarantine attribute caused the safe mode not to be triggered on Quarantined files. This issue was addressed by properly detecting the existence of the Quarantine attribute.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-3713 : Aaron Sigel of vtty.com, Masahiro Yamada

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1

  Impact: Using Autofill on a maliciously crafted website may lead to the disclosure of contact information

  Description: A rare condition existed in the handling of Form Autofill. Using Form Autofill on a maliciously crafted website may have led to disclosure of information from the Address Book "Me" card that was not included in the Autofill popover. This issue was addressed by limiting Autofill to the fields contained in the popover.

  CVE-ID

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1

  Impact: After editing a HTTPS URL in the address bar, a request may be unexpectedly sent over HTTP

  Description: A logic issue existed in the handling of HTTPS URLs in the address bar. If a portion of the address was edited by pasting text, the request may be unexpectedly sent over HTTP. This issue was addressed by improved handling of HTTPS URLs.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-3715 : Aaron Rhoads of East Watch Services LLC, Pepi Zawodsky

* **WebKit**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8 and v10.8.1
