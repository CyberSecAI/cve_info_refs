# NeoInvoice Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2012-3477)

August 12, 2012

[Security Research](https://adamcaudill.com/categories/security-research)

[NeoInvoice](https://github.com/tlhunter/neoinvoice) is a multi-tenant open source invoicing system, that currently contains an unauthenticated blind SQL injection condition in `signup_check.php`. The input for the `value` field isn’t being properly sanitized, and is used in string concatenation to create the SQL query:

```
require_once("config.php");
if (isset($_GET['field']) && ($_GET['field'] == 'username' || $_GET['field'] == 'email')) {
    $field = $_GET['field'];
    $table = 'user';
    $taken = '0';
    $not_taken = '1';
} else if (isset($_GET['field']) && $_GET['field'] == 'coupon') {
    $field = 'name';
    $table = 'coupon';
    $taken = '1';
    $not_taken = '0';
} else {
    die("&lt;div class=\"error\"&gt;Invalid Field&lt;/div&gt;");
}
if (!isset($_GET['value'])) {
    die("&lt;div class=\"error\"&gt;Invalid Value&lt;/div&gt;");
}
$value = preg_replace("[^a-zA-Z0-9_.\-\*\/\+\, @]", "", $_GET['value']);
if ($value != $_GET['value']) {
    die("&lt;div class=\"error\"&gt;Invalid Value&lt;/div&gt;");
}
$connect = mysql_connect(MYSQL_HOSTNAME, MYSQL_USERNAME, MYSQL_PASSWORD);
if (!$connect) {
    die("&lt;div class=\"error\"&gt;" . mysql_error() . "&lt;/div&gt;");
}
$query = "SELECT $field FROM $table WHERE $field = '$value' LIMIT 1";
mysql_select_db(MYSQL_DATABASE, $connect);
$result = mysql_query($query, $connect);
if (mysql_num_rows($result)) {
    echo $taken;
} else {
    echo $not_taken;
}

```

Line #29 there is the key, by concatenating untrusted data into the SQL query, it has made SQL injection trivial. This vulnerability can be demonstrated with the following request:

`signup_check.php?field=username&value='+OR+SLEEP(5)+OR+'`

This results in the following query being executed:

`SELECT username FROM user WHERE username = '' OR SLEEP(5) OR '' LIMIT 1`

The author has been notified, but has yet to respond. Based on the one open [ticket](https://github.com/tlhunter/neoinvoice/issues/2) for the project, there’s likely other possible attack vectors.

# About

## Who I Am [#](#who-i-am)

I’m Adam Caudill, a security engineer, a security researcher, a software developer, father, and atheist. I’m a lover of fine Japanese Katanas, a collector of [bayonets](https://adamcaudill.com/bayonet-collection/), and [photographer](https://adamcaudill.com/photo/).

I started my career in software development, though I’ve always had a passion for security. From the earliest days of my career, it’s been a focus, one that receives far more of my today than it once did. As a result, I eventually shifted away from spending my time writing code, and spent more time on securing code written by others.

Much of my time is spent on breaking software, though I do continue to write code as time allows. I live for challenges, so I tend to stay away from the mundane and focus on things that are a bit more interesting, newer areas that are in need of more help, and more research.

In my youth I spent much of my time on [photography](https://adamcaudill.com/photo/), even working for a while as a photojournalist — though my schedule leaves little time for this today. While I still love the art and science of photography, it’s a passion that I’ve had to leave behind. While I’ve had to step away from photography, the time working as a photojournalist had a huge impact on me, and journalism has been a topic I care deeply about since then.

If you want more, take a look at my [resume](https://adamcaudill.com/resume/); though it’s a bit dated.

## Where to Find Me [#](#where-to-find-me)

I’m active on ~~[Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamcaudill)~~ [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/%40adamcaudill); it’s one of the best ways to reach me. All the code that I can release is on [GitHub](https://github.com/adcaudill), and I try to contribute to other projects as I can.

There are a few ways to contact me, the best are [here](https://adamcaudill.com/contact/).

## Security Research [#](#security-research)

While my interest is mainly in communication systems and applied cryptography (I implement, high level designs, I don’t design primitives), I will work on anything that draws my interest.

My work has been cited by many media outlets and publications around the world, from CNN to Wired and countless others.

If you’d like to know more about the research I do, look through my posts; while not everything I’ve published is there, most things are.

I founded the [BSides Knoxville](https://bsidesknoxville.com/) conference, and the [Underhanded Crypto Contest](https://underhandedcrypto.com/).

**CVEs:** CVE-2012-3477, CVE-2012-4673, CVE-2013-4467, CVE-2013-4468, CVE-2013-7382, CVE-2014-2890, CVE-2015-8267, CVE-2016-2346.

## Software & Open Source [#](#software--open-source)

While I had toyed with writing code (Apple Basic & the like) for years, I hadn’t worked on anything significant until one day when I was 15 I happened on a copy of Visual Basic 5 Deluxe Learning Edition on sale in a book store; being bored and needing something to occupy my time during the summer, I bought it. That single chance event set the course of the rest of my life.

In the years that followed I focused (almost obsessively) on software development, studying C/C++, COBOL, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, Python, and assembly for various processors. While I believe that it’s best to know many languages, to be truly effective you need to know your main languages *very* well. Today, most of my time is spent with C#, Ruby, and a little Go.

![GSuite Logo](https://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/02/gmail_transparent.png#float)

I’ve always had a passion for the open source world and have contributed to numerous projects. I’ve served as the project maintainer for [SWEBS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/swebs/) (a simple, lightweight HTTP server), which had team members spread across the globe, making strong communication skills critical. I’ve contributed to [bbPress](https://bbpress.org/), and various others, plus I [maintain a few projects](https://github.com/adamcaudill) of my own.

Among the applications I’ve released publicly, [GSuite](https://web.archive.org/web/20050101021725/http%3A//www.imspire.com%3A80/gsuite/index.html) (no longer available) was one of my favourites. It was the first major system-tray based alert for Gmail users that they had new mail (plus a few other useful utilities); released long before it was eventually obsoleted by an official application from Google.

## This Site [#](#this-site)

This site is currently powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and hosted with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/); the theme is based on [hugo-kiera](https://github.com/funkydan2/hugo-kiera), though has been extensively modified. I have been using the `adamcaudill.com` domain to host my writing since 2006; I used various others before that, as well as a few different short-lived blogs since then. The content that I found to have at least some value has been merged in here, taking the content back to 2003.

In the past, this site has used WordPress (multiple times), Octopress, and Jekyll. Though with the move to Hugo, I don’t anticipate another switch for the foreseeable future.

To understand how much content I’ve created, there is a [stats](https://adamcaudill.com/stats/) page which lists some useful & interesting information.

  This short story is about the pain of wounds that never heal; it discusses suicidal thoughts, depression, and the lengths people will go to in order to escape the pain of the past. Drafting this story began in December of 2022, and was inspired by a research article on human memory which alluded to therapeutic uses of memory alteration.
  As a long-time student of psychology, and specifically personality disorders, I’ve always been interested in how people deal with trauma and pain.

  This is a short story about death, and what comes after. As is most of my writing, this is somewhat dark. However, it does contain sensitive topics and may be disturbing to some.
  Humanity has always had a complex relationship with death and the dead, and the most burning question for many people is what happens after we die. As an atheist and as a person with a particular interest in philosophy, this is something that I’ve thought about quite a bit.

  The idea for “The Hibbing Test” began in 2015 with a documentry on how humans perceive risk, how they would bet or cash out when playing with free money, and what that exposed about how they saw the world. This story sees a world that becomes dominated by that difference, with one group given power, and the other religated due to their view of the world - and how risk perception plays into it.

# NeoInvoice by Thomas Hunter II

I started building NeoInvoice in 2010. It was hosted at `neoinvoice.com`. The plan
was to maybe one day make money from it, but I never really advertised or monetized
the app. Two years later, after never making a dime and paying about over $1,000 in
hosting costs, I finally realized it was costing more money than it was making me,
so I shut down the app and open sourced it.

## What is NeoInvoice?

NeoInvoice is a set of software tools useful to most online / service businsses. It is
a single app, meant to be used by many different companies, each company having many
different users, all having their own login credentials.

## Video Overview

Visit this page for a video of me showing off all of the features, and some technical
explanation, as well as a bunch of high rez screenshots:

* [NeoInvoice Post-Mortem Video](https://vimeo.com/44206893)

## Features

* Time Tracking
* Issue Tickets
* Email PDF Invoices
* Many Users
* Configurable User Roles
* OS X Dashboard Widget for Entering Time
* etc.

## Technology Stack

NeoInvoice is a PHP, MySQL, Memcache/APC app. It runs on a Linux server, and has been run
using both lighttpd and apache.

## Installation

* Set the root of the website to public/
* chmod 777 public/system/logs/ public/assets/logos/
* Update public/application/config/paypal\_config.php with your paypal email address
* Update public/application/controllers/payment.php with your paypal email address
* Update public/config.php with your MySQL connection settings and domain names
* Update public/config.php with an email address for getting SQL dumps
* If using lighttpd, copy over the resources/lighttpd.conf file
* Set a salt for public/application/libraries/Rm\_user.php
* Set a salt for public/application/models/company\_model.php
* Setup CRON tasks for resources/cron.(daily|weekly).task.txt
* Import resources/schema.sql into your MySQL database
* Replace all instances of neoinvoice.com with your domain
* Either install Wordpress into public/docs/, or remove references to the Wordpress Model

## Administration

I had a directory setup which was password protected, and contained the following scripts:

* APC Control Panel
* eAccelerator Control Panel
* Memcache Control Panel
* SQL Buddy
* phpinfo script

These five scripts were all I needed to administrate the server. There shouldn't be much
upkeep required, however. It takes care of itself pretty well.

## What Sucks?

A lot sucks. I'll start making some tickets for all of the things I'm aware of which
is broken (if there is interest for anyone to fix the issues). I probably won't be
doing much development myself, but I don't mind facilitating a bunch of pull requests.

## Git History

I was keeping track of the entire history of the project, and had near 400 commits,
but while doing some git history changing operations to remove sensitive data, bad
things started to happen. So, I flattened the repo and started from scratch. Most of
these files are 1 to 2 years old.

## License

This application is released under a dual GPL/BSD license. You can use whichever one
you would prefer. This app makes use of several open source technologies, and they
all have their own licenses, and are of course not bound to the overall NeoInvoice
license. These projects usually have a LICENSE and README file in their directory.

## Where to Find Me [#](#where-to-find-me)

I post my work in a variety of locations, for different purposes. Here are the main places you’ll find my work:

* [Portfolio](https://photo.adamcaudill.com/): A collection of my favourite works.

## About My Photography [#](#about-my-photography)

While I have a true passion for software and security, my other great love is [photography](https://photo.adamcaudill.com). My love of photography came from working as a photojournalist during my teen years for a small newspaper in East Tennessee. During the time I worked there, I came to understand the importance of visual media and the critical importance of freedoms granted to the press.

The power of a great photograph to impart emotion on the viewer is remarkable; while I began working as a photographer to document the world and tell the story of current events, today, I focus on the art.

My early years in serious photography was almost exclusively with 35mm film and manual cameras (that said, I’ve had a camera in my hand almost from the time I could walk). I still have a love for film photography, though the cost of film and the number of frames I shoot finally pushed me to digital exclusively.

### Gear [#](#gear)

I’ve used a wide variety of gear over the years, though I will offer a few highlights.

#### Film [#](#film)

The Yashica FX-3 Super 2000 powered my work in photojournalism; a great all manual camera — the only bit of electronics was the in-viewfinder light meter. An absolute workhorse and a camera I still love. The ability to shoot in areas so dark that auto-focus cameras couldn’t get a clear shot came in handy on many occasions. After that work ended, I moved to the Canon AE-1 Program (with Power Winder) as my go-to camera — while well outdated when I started using it, I fell in love with it immediately. It was, without question, my favourite camera of all time. I did shoot with automatic cameras such as the Nikon N90s (and other assorted Nikon cameras), though without the joy that the AE-1 gave me.

#### Digital [#](#digital)

As with film, I’ve used a variety of cameras, such as the Nikon D40x, D80, and more recently the Fujifilm X-T20. Today, there are two primary cameras that I use:

* iPhone 13 Pro Max
* Fujifilm X-T3

For the iPhone, I generally shoot using [Obscura](https://obscura.app/) and the Rands filter. For the XT-3, I use the excellent ACROS film simulation with Red filter, and increased contrast to get the look I’m after.

### Photographic Purism [#](#photographic-purism)

It’s exceedingly rare that any alterations are made to my photographs (with the exception of a signature); no cropping, no color adjustments, nothing. While photo editing has become an art in it’s own right, it’s not one I’m interested in.

I focus on finding interesting perspectives of the world, and present those as-is. What I see in the viewfinder is what I share.

### Style [#](#style)

I very rarely shoot in color, I much prefer darker black & white images, I find that they convey the subject in a much purer form, without the distraction of color. I tend to focus on everyday life, from interesting (if not unexpected) angles. I rarely shoot landscapes, tend to avoid people more often than not, and shoot exclusively with natural light.
