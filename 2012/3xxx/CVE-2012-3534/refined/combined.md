How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: information request on security bug fix in GNU Gatekeeper 3.1

Hi Jan,

On the announcement of release 3.1 of GNU Gatekeeper[1] there's a mention of
a security bug fix.
Could you please shed some light on the security issue? is it related to the
status port connection limit feature that was recently added in [2] and
similar?

Thanks in advance.

Hi Raphael,

I was planning to give people a few days to update before releasing
detailed information.

But you are right, the possibility to create an unlimited number of
connections each with its own thread handling it is the issue that
creates an easy possibility for a DOS attack.

Regards,
Jan

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2012-08-27 14:36:26 UTC  ``` is public, via oss-sec  CVE-2012-3534  From: Raphael Geissert <geissert@debian.org> Subject: [oss-security] information request on security bug fix in GNU Gatekeeper 3.1  On the announcement of release 3.1 of GNU Gatekeeper[1] there's a mention of  a security bug fix. Could you please shed some light on the security issue? is it related to the  status port connection limit feature that was recently added in [2] and  similar?  Thanks in advance.  Found via secunia SA50343 [3]  [1]<http://www.gnugk.org/gnugk-3.1.html> [2]<http://openh323gk.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openh323gk/openh323gk/GkStatus.cxx?r1=1.132&r2=1.133> [3]<http://secunia.com/advisories/50343/>   From: Jan Willamowius <jan@willamowius.de> Hi Raphael,  I was planning to give people a few days to update before releasing detailed information.  But you are right, the possibility to create an unlimited number of connections each with its own thread handling it is the issue that creates an easy possibility for a DOS attack.  Regards, Jan ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2012-08-27 14:37:07 UTC  ``` Peter, I assigned this to you, as you are the first bugowner listed in network:telephony.  the gnugk there in is quite old though. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2012-08-27 22:00:40 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2015-03-30 11:13:39 UTC  ``` Not in SLES, moving to openSUSE.

Agree in general, as we are more free to do so in openSUSE. We have these versions:  openSUSE:13.1               gnugk      2.2.6 openSUSE:13.2               gnugk      2.2.6 openSUSE:Factory            gnugk      2.2.6 network:telephony           gnugk      2.2.6  > I'd be happy to assist the package maintainer with the version update.  If you would like to have a dash at this you are more than welcome, and we will be happy to support you when you are stick.  The first step would be to get a working build of 3.8 going as a branch of the development package, which is in: [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/network:telephony/gnugk](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/network%3Atelephony/gnugk)  Once it is updated there we can see how to proceed.  Please see this link for a general instructions: [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:How_to_contribute_to_Factory](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3AHow_to_contribute_to_Factory)  Active package maintainers are always welcome, and it looks like this one needs some love. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c6)  Forgotten User DIB2eCsDKI   2015-03-30 13:12:45 UTC  ``` Version 2.2.6 is 8 years old now...  I looked at the factory system before and it is more complicated than I'm willing to learn. But if there is a package maintainer who knows how to handle the factory, I'd be happy to explain how the GNU Gatekeeper can be compiled on Suse. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c7)  Andreas Stieger   2015-03-30 14:09:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jan Willamowius from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c6)) > Version 2.2.6 is 8 years old now... >  > I looked at the factory system before and it is more complicated than I'm > willing to learn. But if there is a package maintainer who knows how to > handle the factory, I'd be happy to explain how the GNU Gatekeeper can be > compiled on Suse.  Do you have this in the form of a working spec file you could reference? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c8)  Forgotten User DIB2eCsDKI   2015-03-30 14:21:55 UTC  ``` I don't have a spec file.  I wrote general notes on compiling <http://www.gnugk.org/compiling-gnugk.html>  and an Ubuntu version <http://www.gnugk.org/gnugk-manual-14.html#ss14.1>  Your main issue are going to be library version conflicts with other packages. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c9)  Andreas Stieger   2015-07-24 18:29:12 UTC  ``` Lack of active maintainership is worrying.  Looks like Denisart has prepared current packages in  [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:posophe:branches:network:telephony/gnugk](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home%3Aposophe%3Abranches%3Anetwork%3Atelephony/gnugk)  including updated dependencies in  [https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:posophe:branches:network:telephony](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home%3Aposophe%3Abranches%3Anetwork%3Atelephony)  Denisart are you willing to submit this into network:telephony and Factory? ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c10)  Denisart Benjamin   2015-07-24 21:02:40 UTC  ``` Yes I am. But I'm still working on some other packages depending on h323plus. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c11)  Andreas Stieger   2016-06-03 12:55:22 UTC  ``` What remains is maintenance for the following:  openSUSE:13.2               gnugk      2.2.6 openSUSE:Leap:42.1          gnugk      2.2.6  The only missing dependency for a version upgrade seems to be h323plus-devel. (Not counting build deps not specified with versions in the spec, or things not noticed by osc)  Is 4.0 or 4.2 something you could provide as a backport? ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=777486#c12)  Denisart Benjamin   2016-07-15 18:45:17 UTC  ``` How can I do that ?
