How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

vfs: make O\_PATH file descriptors usable for 'fstat()'
commit 55815f70147dcfa3ead5738fd56d3574e2e3c1c2 upstream.
We already use them for openat() and friends, but fstat() also wants to
be able to use O\_PATH file descriptors. This should make it more
directly comparable to the O\_SEARCH of Solaris.
Note that you could already do the same thing with "fstatat()" and an
empty path, but just doing "fstat()" directly is simpler and faster, so
there is no reason not to just allow it directly.
See also commit 332a2e1244bd, which did the same thing for fchdir, for
the same reasons.

eCryptfs: Copy up attributes of the lower target inode after rename
commit 8335eafc2859e1a26282bef7c3d19f3d68868b8a upstream.
After calling into the lower filesystem to do a rename, the lower target
inode's attributes were not copied up to the eCryptfs target inode. This
resulted in the eCryptfs target inode staying around, rather than being
evicted, because i\_nlink was not updated for the eCryptfs inode. This
also meant that eCryptfs didn't do the final iput() on the lower target
inode so it stayed around, as well. This would result in a failure to
free up space occupied by the target file in the rename() operation.
Both target inodes would eventually be evicted when the eCryptfs
filesystem was unmounted.
This patch calls fsstack\_copy\_attr\_all() after the lower filesystem
does its ->rename() so that important inode attributes, such as i\_nlink,
are updated at the eCryptfs layer. ecryptfs\_evict\_inode() is now called
and eCryptfs can drop its final reference on the lower inode.

drm/radeon: rework pll selection (v3)
commit 985f61f7ee647ad570c05eab0b74915da2ac8e19 upstream.
For DP we can use the same PPLL for all active DP
encoders. Take advantage of that to prevent cases
where we may end up sharing a PPLL between DP and
non-DP which won't work. Also clean up the code
a bit.
v2: - fix missing pll\_id assignment in crtc init
v3: - fix DP PPLL check
- document functions
- break in main encoder search loop after matching.
no need to keep checking additional encoders.

commit 3737e2be505d872bf2b3c1cd4151b2d2b413d7b5 upstream.
The AK4396 DAC has a linear-scale attentuator, but
sound/pci/ice1712/prodigy\_hifi.c used a log scale instead, which is
not quite right. This patch restores the correct scale, borrowing
from the ak4396 code in sound/pci/oxygen/oxygen.c.

EHCI: Update qTD next pointer in QH overlay region during unlink
commit 3d037774b42ed677f699b1dce7d548d55f4e4c2b upstream.
There is a possibility of QH overlay region having reference to a stale
qTD pointer during unlink.
Consider an endpoint having two pending qTD before unlink process begins.
The endpoint's QH queue looks like this.
qTD1 --> qTD2 --> Dummy
To unlink qTD2, QH is removed from asynchronous list and Asynchronous
Advance Doorbell is programmed. The qTD1's next qTD pointer is set to
qTD2'2 next qTD pointer and qTD2 is retired upon controller's doorbell
interrupt. If QH's current qTD pointer points to qTD1, transfer overlay
region still have reference to qTD2. But qtD2 is just unlinked and freed.
This may cause EHCI system error. Fix this by updating qTD next pointer
in QH overlay region with the qTD next pointer of the current qTD.

USB: ftdi\_sio: do not claim CDC ACM function
commit f08dea734844aa42ec57c229b0b73b3d7d21f810 upstream.
The Microchip vid:pid 04d8:000a is used for their CDC ACM
demo firmware application. This is a device with a single
function conforming to the CDC ACM specification and with
the intention of demonstrating CDC ACM class firmware and
driver interaction. The demo is used on a number of
development boards, and may also be used unmodified by
vendors using Microchip hardware.
Some vendors have re-used this vid:pid for other types of
firmware, emulating FTDI chips. Attempting to continue to
support such devices without breaking class based
applications that by matching on interface
class/subclass/proto being ff/ff/00. I have no information
about the actual device or interface descriptors, but this
will at least make the proper CDC ACM devices work again.
Anyone having details of the offending device's descriptors
should update this entry with the details.

ALSA: hda - Fix Oops at codec reset/reconfig
commit 07dc59f0988cb54fd87bd373b3b27eb2401dd811 upstream.
snd\_hda\_codec\_reset() calls restore\_pincfgs() where the codec is
powered up again, which eventually tries to resume and initialize via
the callbacks of the codec. However, it's the place just after codec
free callback, thus no codec callbacks should be called after that.
On a codec like CS4206, it results in Oops due to the access in init
callback.
This patch fixes the issue by clearing the codec callbacks properly
after freeing codec.

hangs in the case of NFS over UDP mounts.
Since neither the UDP or the RDMA transport mechanism use dynamic slot
allocation, we can skip grabbing the socket lock for those transports.
Add a new rpc\_xprt\_op to allow switching between the TCP and UDP/RDMA
case.
Note that the NFSv4.1 back channel assigns the slot directly
through rpc\_run\_bc\_task, so we can ignore that case.

This is a completely different CONFIG\_HOTPLUG problem, only
demonstrating another reason why CONFIG\_HOTPLUG should go away. I had a
hard time trying to disable it anyway ;-)
The problem this time is lots of code assuming that a call to
add\_uevent\_var() will guarantee that env->buflen > 0. This is not true
if CONFIG\_HOTPLUG is unset. So things like this end up overwriting
env->envp\_idx because the array index is -1:
if (add\_uevent\_var(env, "MODALIAS="))
return -ENOMEM;
len = input\_print\_modalias(&env->buf[env->buflen - 1],
sizeof(env->buf) - env->buflen,
dev, 0);
Don't know what the best action is, given that there seem to be a \*lot\*
of this around the kernel. This patch "fixes" the problem for me, but I
don't know if it can be considered an appropriate fix.
[ It is the correct fix for now, for 3.7 forcing CONFIG\_HOTPLUG to
always be on is the longterm fix, but it's too late for 3.6 and older
kernels to resolve this that way - gregkh ]

ibmveth: Fix alignment of rx queue bug
commit d90c92fee89ccd75ef2646f3bde0b4c0450666c3 upstream.
This patch fixes a bug found by Nish Aravamudan
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/5/15/220) where the driver is not following
the spec (it is not aligning the rx buffer on a 16-byte boundary) and the
hypervisor aborts the registration, making the device unusable.
The fix follows BenH's recommendation (https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/20/461)
to replace the kmalloc+map for a single call to dma\_alloc\_coherent()
because that function always aligns to a 16-byte boundary.
The stable trees will run into this bug whenever the rx buffer kmalloc call
returns something not aligned on a 16-byte boundary.

commit 9ec1882df244c4ee1baa692676fef5e8b0f5487d upstream.
The console feature's write routing is unsafe on SMP with

There could be several consumers of the console
\* the kernel printk
\* the init process using /dev/kmsg to call printk to show log
\* shell, which open /dev/console and write with sys\_write()
The shell goes into the normal uart open/write routing,
but the other two go into the console operations.
The open routing calls imx serial startup, which will write USR1/2
register without any lock and critical with imx\_console\_write call.
Add a spin\_lock for startup/shutdown/console\_write routing.

usb: host: xhci: Fix Compliance Mode on SN65LVPE502CP Hardware
commit 71c731a296f1b08a3724bd1b514b64f1bda87a23 upstream.
This patch is intended to work around a known issue on the
SN65LVPE502CP USB3.0 re-driver that can delay the negotiation
between a device and the host past the usual handshake timeout.
If that happens on the first insertion, the host controller
port will enter in Compliance Mode and NO port status event will
be generated (as per xHCI Spec) making impossible to detect this
event by software. The port will remain in compliance mode until
a warm reset is applied to it.
As a result of this, the port will seem "dead" to the user and no
device connections or disconnections will be detected.
For solving this, the patch creates a timer which polls every 2
seconds the link state of each host controller's port (this
by reading the PORTSC register) and recovers the port by issuing a
Warm reset every time Compliance mode is detected.
If a xHC USB3.0 port has previously entered to U0, the compliance
mode issue will NOT occur only until system resumes from
sleep/hibernate, therefore, the compliance mode timer is stopped
when all xHC USB 3.0 ports have entered U0. The timer is initialized
again after each system resume.
Since the issue is being caused by a piece of hardware, the timer
will be enabled ONLY on those systems that have the SN65LVPE502CP
installed (this patch uses DMI strings for detecting those systems)
therefore making this patch to act as a quirk (XHCI\_COMP\_MODE\_QUIRK
has been added to the xhci stack).
This patch applies for these systems:
Vendor: Hewlett-Packard. System Models: Z420, Z620 and Z820.
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, as that was
the first kernel to support warm reset. The kernels will need to
contain both commit 10d674a82e553cb8a1f41027bb3c3e309b3f6804 "USB: When
hot reset for USB3 fails, try warm reset" and commit
8bea2bd37df08aaa599aa361a9f8b836ba98e554 "usb: Add support for root hub
port status CAS". The first patch add warm reset support, and the
second patch modifies the USB core to issue a warm reset when the port
is in compliance mode.

xhci: Make handover code more robust
commit e955a1cd086de4d165ae0f4c7be7289d84b63bdc upstream.
My test platform (Intel DX79SI) boots reliably under BIOS, but frequently
crashes when booting via UEFI. I finally tracked this down to the xhci
handoff code. It seems that reads from the device occasionally just return
0xff, resulting in xhci\_find\_next\_cap\_offset generating a value that's
larger than the resource region. We then oops when attempting to read the
value. Sanity checking that value lets us avoid the crash.
I've no idea what's causing the underlying problem, and xhci still doesn't
actually \*work\* even with this, but the machine at least boots which will
probably make further debugging easier.

xhci: Switch PPT ports to EHCI on shutdown.
commit e95829f474f0db3a4d940cae1423783edd966027 upstream.
The Intel desktop boards DH77EB and DH77DF have a hardware issue that
can be worked around by BIOS. If the USB ports are switched to xHCI on
shutdown, the xHCI host will send a spurious interrupt, which will wake
the system. Some BIOS will work around this, but not all.
The bug can be avoided if the USB ports are switched back to EHCI on
shutdown. The Intel Windows driver switches the ports back to EHCI, so
change the Linux xHCI driver to do the same.
Unfortunately, we can't tell the two effected boards apart from other
working motherboards, because the vendors will change the DMI strings
for the DH77EB and DH77DF boards to their own custom names. One example
is Compulab's mini-desktop, the Intense-PC. Instead, key off the
Panther Point xHCI host PCI vendor and device ID, and switch the ports
over for all PPT xHCI hosts.
The only impact this will have on non-effected boards is to add a couple
hundred milliseconds delay on boot when the BIOS has to switch the ports
over from EHCI to xHCI.
This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contain
the commit 69e848c2090aebba5698a1620604c7dccb448684 "Intel xhci: Support

staging: zcache: fix cleancache race condition with shrinker
commit 6d7d9798ad5c97ee4e911dd070dc12dc5ae55bd0 upstream.
This patch fixes a race condition that results in memory
corruption when using cleancache.
The race exists between the zcache shrinker handler,
shrink\_zcache\_memory() and cleancache\_get\_page().
In most cases, the shrinker will both evict a zbpg
from its buddy list and flush it from tmem before a
cleancache\_get\_page() occurs on that page. A subsequent
cleancache\_get\_page() will fail in the tmem layer.
In the rare case that two occur together and the
cleancache\_get\_page() path gets through the tmem
layer before the shrinker path can flush tmem,
zbud\_decompress() does a check to see if the zbpg is a
"zombie", i.e. not on a buddy list, which means the shrinker
is in the process of reclaiming it. If the zbpg is a zombie,
zbud\_decompress() returns -EINVAL.
However, this return code is being ignored by the caller,
zcache\_pampd\_get\_data\_and\_free(), which results in the
caller of cleancache\_get\_page() thinking that the page has
been properly retrieved when it has not.
This patch modifies zcache\_pampd\_get\_data\_and\_free() to
convey the failure up the stack so that the caller of
cleancache\_get\_page() knows the page retrieval failed.
This needs to be applied to stable trees as well.
zcache-main.c was named zcache.c before v3.1, so
I'm not sure how you want to handle trees earlier
than that.

rt2800usb: Added rx packet length validity check
commit efd5d6b03bd9c9e0df646c56fb5f4f3e25e5c1ac upstream.
On our system (ARM Cortex-M3 SOC running linux-2.6.33)
frequent crashes were observed in the rt2800usb module
because of the invalid length of the received packet (3392,
46920...). This patch adds the sanity check on the packet
legth. Also, changed WARNING to ERROR in rt2x00lib\_rxdone()
so that the bad packet condition would be noticed.
The fix was tested on the latest compat-wireless-3.5.1-1-snpc.

rt2x00: Fix rfkill polling prior to interface start.
commit a396e10019eaf3809b0219c966865aaafec12630 upstream.
We need to program the rfkill switch GPIO pin direction to input at
device initialization time, not only when the interface is brought up.
Doing this only when the interface is brought up could lead to rfkill
detecting the switch is turned on erroneously and inability to create
the interface and bringing it up.

Intel xhci: Only switch the switchable ports
commit a96874a2a92feaef607ddd3137277a788cb927a6 upstream.
With a previous patch to enable the EHCI/XHCI port switching, it switches
all the available ports.
The assumption is not correct because the BIOS may expect some ports
not switchable by the OS.
There are two more registers that contains the information of the switchable
and non-switchable ports.
This patch adds the checking code for the two register so that only the
switchable ports are altered.

NFS: Fix the initialisation of the readdir 'cookieverf' array
commit c3f52af3e03013db5237e339c817beaae5ec9e3a upstream.
When the NFS\_COOKIEVERF helper macro was converted into a static
inline function in commit 99fadcd764 (nfs: convert NFS\_\*(inode)
helpers to static inline), we broke the initialisation of the
readdir cookies, since that depended on doing a memset with an
argument of 'sizeof(NFS\_COOKIEVERF(inode))' which therefore
changed from sizeof(be32 cookieverf[2]) to sizeof(be32 \*).
At this point, NFS\_COOKIEVERF seems to be more of an obfuscation
than a helper, so the best thing would be to just get rid of it.

Basically, setting TXBnCTRL.TXREQ in either SPI mode (00 or 11) will eventually

ARM: 7496/1: hw\_breakpoint: don't rely on dfsr to show watchpoint access type
commit bf8801145c01ab600f8df66e8c879ac642fa5846 upstream.
From ARM debug architecture v7.1 onwards, a watchpoint exception causes
the DFAR to be updated with the faulting data address. However, DFSR.WnR
takes an UNKNOWN value and therefore cannot be used in general to
determine the access type that triggered the watchpoint.
This patch forbids watchpoints without an overflow handler from
specifying a specific access type (load/store). Those with overflow
handlers must be able to handle false positives potentially triggered by
a watchpoint of a different access type on the same address. For
SIGTRAP-based handlers (i.e. ptrace), this should have no impact.

Swap entries are encoding in ptes such that !pte\_present(pte) and
pte\_file(pte). The remaining bits of the descriptor are used to identify
the swapfile and offset within it to the swap entry.
When writing such a pte for a user virtual address, set\_pte\_at
unconditionally sets the nG bit, which (in the case of LPAE) will
corrupt the swapfile offset and lead to a BUG:

xhci: Fix bug after deq ptr set to link TRB.
This patch fixes a particularly nasty bug that was revealed by the ring
expansion patches. The bug has been present since the very beginning of
the xHCI driver history, and could have caused general protection faults
from bad memory accesses.
The first thing to note is that a Set TR Dequeue Pointer command can
move the dequeue pointer to a link TRB, if the canceled or stalled
transfer TD ended just before a link TRB. The function to increment the
dequeue pointer, inc\_deq, was written before cancellation and stall
support was added. It assumed that the dequeue pointer could never
point to a link TRB. It would unconditionally increment the dequeue
pointer at the start of the function, check if the pointer was now on a
link TRB, and move it to the top of the next segment if so.
This means that if a Set TR Dequeue Point command moved the dequeue
pointer to a link TRB, a subsequent call to inc\_deq() would move the
pointer off the segment and into la-la-land. It would then read from
that memory to determine if it was a link TRB. Other functions would
often call inc\_deq() until the dequeue pointer matched some other
pointer, which means this function would quite happily read all of
system memory before wrapping around to the right pointer value.
Often, there would be another endpoint segment from a different ring
allocated from the same DMA pool, which would be contiguous to the
segment inc\_deq just stepped off of. inc\_deq would eventually find the
link TRB in that segment, and blindly move the dequeue pointer back to
the top of the correct ring segment.
The only reason the original code worked at all is because there was
only one ring segment. With the ring expansion patches, the dequeue
pointer would eventually wrap into place, but the dequeue segment would
be out-of-sync. On the second TD after the dequeue pointer was moved to
a link TRB, trb\_in\_td() would fail (because the dequeue pointer and
dequeue segment were out-of-sync), and this message would appear:
ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD
This fixes bugzilla entry 4333 (option-based modem unhappy on USB 3.0
port: "Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of current TD", "rejecting
I/O to offline device"),
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=43333
and possibly other general protection fault bugs as well.

original upstream commit is 50d0206fcaea3e736f912fd5b00ec6233fb4ce44,
but it does not apply to kernels older than 3.4, because inc\_deq was

During modeset we have to disable the pipe to reconfigure its timings
and maybe its size. Userspace may have queued up command buffers that
depend upon the pipe running in a certain configuration and so the
commands may become confused across the modeset. At the moment, we use a
less than satisfactory kick-scanline-waits should the GPU hang during
the modeset. It should be more reliable to wait for the pending
operations to complete first, even though we still have a window for
userspace to submit a broken command buffer during the modeset.

time: Move ktime\_t overflow checking into timespec\_valid\_strict
This is a -stable backport of cee58483cf56e0ba355fdd97ff5e8925329aa936
Andreas Bombe reported that the added ktime\_t overflow checking added to
timespec\_valid in commit 4e8b14526ca7 ("time: Improve sanity checking of
timekeeping inputs") was causing problems with X.org because it caused
timeouts larger then KTIME\_T to be invalid.
Previously, these large timeouts would be clamped to KTIME\_MAX and would
never expire, which is valid.
This patch splits the ktime\_t overflow checking into a new
timespec\_valid\_strict function, and converts the timekeeping codes
internal checking to use this more strict function.

time: Improve sanity checking of timekeeping inputs
This is a -stable backport of 4e8b14526ca7fb046a81c94002c1c43b6fdf0e9b
Unexpected behavior could occur if the time is set to a value large
enough to overflow a 64bit ktime\_t (which is something larger then the
year 2262).
Also unexpected behavior could occur if large negative offsets are
injected via adjtimex.
So this patch improves the sanity check timekeeping inputs by
improving the timespec\_valid() check, and then makes better use of
timespec\_valid() to make sure we don't set the time to an invalid
negative value or one that overflows ktime\_t.
Note: This does not protect from setting the time close to overflowing
ktime\_t and then letting natural accumulation cause the overflow.

workqueue: UNBOUND -> REBIND morphing in rebind\_workers() should be atomic
commit 96e65306b81351b656835c15931d1d237b252f27 upstream.
The compiler may compile the following code into TWO write/modify
instructions.
worker->flags &= ~WORKER\_UNBOUND;
worker->flags |= WORKER\_REBIND;
so the other CPU may temporarily see worker->flags which doesn't have
either WORKER\_UNBOUND or WORKER\_REBIND set and perform local wakeup
prematurely.
Fix it by using single explicit assignment via ACCESS\_ONCE().
Because idle workers have another WORKER\_NOT\_RUNNING flag, this bug
doesn't exist for them; however, update it to use the same pattern for
consistency.
tj: Applied the change to idle workers too and updated comments and
patch description a bit.
stable: Idle worker rebinding doesn't apply for -stable and
WORKER\_UNBOUND used to be WORKER\_ROGUE. Updated accordingly.

net: ipv4: ipmr\_expire\_timer causes crash when removing net namespace
[ Upstream commit acbb219d5f53821b2d0080d047800410c0420ea1 ]
When tearing down a net namespace, ipv4 mr\_table structures are freed
without first deactivating their timers. This can result in a crash in
run\_timer\_softirq.
This patch mimics the corresponding behaviour in ipv6.
Locking and synchronization seem to be adequate.
We are about to kfree mrt, so existing code should already make sure that
no other references to mrt are pending or can be created by incoming traffic.
The functions invoked here do not cause new references to mrt or other
race conditions to be created.
Invoking del\_timer\_sync guarantees that ipmr\_expire\_timer is inactive.
Both ipmr\_expire\_process (whose completion we may have to wait in
del\_timer\_sync) and mroute\_clean\_tables internally use mfc\_unres\_lock
or other synchronizations when needed, and they both only modify mrt.
Tested in Linux 3.4.8.

netlink: fix possible spoofing from non-root processes
[ Upstream commit 20e1db19db5d6b9e4e83021595eab0dc8f107bef ]
Non-root user-space processes can send Netlink messages to other
processes that are well-known for being subscribed to Netlink
asynchronous notifications. This allows ilegitimate non-root
process to send forged messages to Netlink subscribers.
The userspace process usually verifies the legitimate origin in
two ways:
a) Socket credentials. If UID != 0, then the message comes from
some ilegitimate process and the message needs to be dropped.
b) Netlink portID. In general, portID == 0 means that the origin
of the messages comes from the kernel. Thus, discarding any
message not coming from the kernel.
However, ctnetlink sets the portID in event messages that has
been triggered by some user-space process, eg. conntrack utility.
So other processes subscribed to ctnetlink events, eg. conntrackd,
know that the event was triggered by some user-space action.
Neither of the two ways to discard ilegitimate messages coming
from non-root processes can help for ctnetlink.
This patch adds capability validation in case that dst\_pid is set
in netlink\_sendmsg(). This approach is aggressive since existing
applications using any Netlink bus to deliver messages between
two user-space processes will break. Note that the exception is
NETLINK\_USERSOCK, since it is reserved for netlink-to-netlink
userspace communication.
Still, if anyone wants that his Netlink bus allows netlink-to-netlink
userspace, then they can set NL\_NONROOT\_SEND. However, by default,
I don't think it makes sense to allow to use NETLINK\_ROUTE to
communicate two processes that are sending no matter what information
that is not related to link/neighbouring/routing. They should be using
NETLINK\_USERSOCK instead for that.

af\_netlink: force credentials passing [CVE-2012-3520]
[ Upstream commit e0e3cea46d31d23dc40df0a49a7a2c04fe8edfea ]
Pablo Neira Ayuso discovered that avahi and
potentially NetworkManager accept spoofed Netlink messages because of a
kernel bug. The kernel passes all-zero SCM\_CREDENTIALS ancillary data
to the receiver if the sender did not provide such data, instead of not
including any such data at all or including the correct data from the
peer (as it is the case with AF\_UNIX).
This bug was introduced in commit 16e572626961
(af\_unix: dont send SCM\_CREDENTIALS by default)
This patch forces passing credentials for netlink, as
before the regression.
Another fix would be to not add SCM\_CREDENTIALS in
netlink messages if not provided by the sender, but it
might break some programs.

af\_packet: don't emit packet on orig fanout group
[ Upstream commit c0de08d04215031d68fa13af36f347a6cfa252ca ]
If a packet is emitted on one socket in one group of fanout sockets,
it is transmitted again. It is thus read again on one of the sockets
of the fanout group. This result in a loop for software which
generate packets when receiving one.
This retransmission is not the intended behavior: a fanout group
must behave like a single socket. The packet should not be
transmitted on a socket if it originates from a socket belonging
to the same fanout group.
This patch fixes the issue by changing the transmission check to
take fanout group info account.

The LLC code wrongly returns 0, i.e. "success", when the socket is

sys\_getsockname this leads to an arbitrary memory leak of up to 128
bytes kernel stack via the getsockname() syscall.
Return an error instead when the socket is zapped to prevent the info
leak. Also remove the unnecessary memset(0). We don't directly write to
the memory pointed by uaddr but memcpy() a local structure at the end of
the function that is properly initialized.

af\_packet: remove BUG statement in tpacket\_destruct\_skb
[ Upstream commit 7f5c3e3a80e6654cf48dfba7cf94f88c6b505467 ]
Here's a quote of the comment about the BUG macro from asm-generic/bug.h:
Don't use BUG() or BUG\_ON() unless there's really no way out; one
example might be detecting data structure corruption in the middle
of an operation that can't be backed out of. If the (sub)system
can somehow continue operating, perhaps with reduced functionality,
it's probably not BUG-worthy.
If you're tempted to BUG(), think again: is completely giving up
really the \*only\* solution? There are usually better options, where
users don't need to reboot ASAP and can mostly shut down cleanly.
In our case, the status flag of a ring buffer slot is managed from both sides,
the kernel space and the user space. This means that even though the kernel
side might work as expected, the user space screws up and changes this flag
right between the send(2) is triggered when the flag is changed to
TP\_STATUS\_SENDING and a given skb is destructed after some time. Then, this
will hit the BUG macro. As David suggested, the best solution is to simply
remove this statement since it cannot be used for kernel side internal
consistency checks. I've tested it and the system still behaves /stable/ in
this case, so in accordance with the above comment, we should rather remove it.

sfc: Fix maximum number of TSO segments and minimum TX queue size
[ Upstream commit 7e6d06f0de3f74ca929441add094518ae332257c ]
Currently an skb requiring TSO may not fit within a minimum-size TX
queue. The TX queue selected for the skb may stall and trigger the TX
watchdog repeatedly (since the problem skb will be retried after the
TX reset). This issue is designated as CVE-2012-3412.
Set the maximum number of TSO segments for our devices to 100. This
should make no difference to behaviour unless the actual MSS is less
than about 700. Increase the minimum TX queue size accordingly to
allow for 2 worst-case skbs, so that there will definitely be space
to add an skb after we wake a queue.
To avoid invalidating existing configurations, change
efx\_ethtool\_set\_ringparam() to fix up values that are too small rather
than returning -EINVAL.

net: Allow driver to limit number of GSO segments per skb
[ Upstream commit 30b678d844af3305cda5953467005cebb5d7b687 ]
A peer (or local user) may cause TCP to use a nominal MSS of as little
as 88 (actual MSS of 76 with timestamps). Given that we have a
sufficiently prodigious local sender and the peer ACKs quickly enough,
it is nevertheless possible to grow the window for such a connection
to the point that we will try to send just under 64K at once. This
results in a single skb that expands to 861 segments.
In some drivers with TSO support, such an skb will require hundreds of
DMA descriptors; a substantial fraction of a TX ring or even more than
a full ring. The TX queue selected for the skb may stall and trigger
the TX watchdog repeatedly (since the problem skb will be retried
after the TX reset). This particularly affects sfc, for which the
issue is designated as CVE-2012-3412.
Therefore:
1. Add the field net\_device::gso\_max\_segs holding the device-specific
limit.
2. In netif\_skb\_features(), if the number of segments is too high then
mask out GSO features to force fall back to software GSO.

xen: Use correct masking in xen\_swiotlb\_alloc\_coherent.
commit b5031ed1be0aa419250557123633453753181643 upstream.
When running 32-bit pvops-dom0 and a driver tries to allocate a coherent
DMA-memory the xen swiotlb-implementation returned memory beyond 4GB.
The underlaying reason is that if the supplied driver passes in a
DMA\_BIT\_MASK(64) ( hwdev->coherent\_dma\_mask is set to 0xffffffffffffffff)
our dma\_mask will be u64 set to 0xffffffffffffffff even if we set it to
DMA\_BIT\_MASK(32) previously. Meaning we do not reset the upper bits.
By using the dma\_alloc\_coherent\_mask function - it does the proper casting
and we get 0xfffffffff.
This caused not working sound on a system with 4 GB and a 64-bit
compatible sound-card with sets the DMA-mask to 64bit.
On bare-metal and the forward-ported xen-dom0 patches from OpenSuse a coherent
DMA-memory is always allocated inside the 32-bit address-range by calling
dma\_alloc\_coherent\_mask.
This patch adds the same functionality to xen swiotlb and is a rebase of the
original patch from Ronny Hegewald which never got upstream b/c the
underlaying reason was not understood until now.

commit 9c2fc0de1a6e638fe58c354a463f544f42a90a09 upstream.
When a file is stored in ICB (inode), we overwrite part of the file, and
the page containing file's data is not in page cache, we end up corrupting
file's data by overwriting them with zeros. The problem is we use
simple\_write\_begin() which simply zeroes parts of the page which are not
written to. The problem has been introduced by be021ee4 (udf: convert to
new aops).
Fix the problem by providing a ->write\_begin function which makes the page
properly uptodate.

powerpc: Make sure IPI handlers see data written by IPI senders
commit 9fb1b36ca1234e64a5d1cc573175303395e3354d upstream.
We have been observing hangs, both of KVM guest vcpu tasks and more
generally, where a process that is woken doesn't properly wake up and
continue to run, but instead sticks in TASK\_WAKING state. This
happens because the update of rq->wake\_list in ttwu\_queue\_remote()
is not ordered with the update of ipi\_message in
smp\_muxed\_ipi\_message\_pass(), and the reading of rq->wake\_list in
scheduler\_ipi() is not ordered with the reading of ipi\_message in
smp\_ipi\_demux(). Thus it is possible for the IPI receiver not to see
the updated rq->wake\_list and therefore conclude that there is nothing
for it to do.
In order to make sure that anything done before smp\_send\_reschedule()
is ordered before anything done in the resulting call to scheduler\_ipi(),
this adds barriers in smp\_muxed\_message\_pass() and smp\_ipi\_demux().
The barrier in smp\_muxed\_message\_pass() is a full barrier to ensure that
there is a full ordering between the smp\_send\_reschedule() caller and
scheduler\_ipi(). In smp\_ipi\_demux(), we use xchg() rather than
xchg\_local() because xchg() includes release and acquire barriers.
Using xchg() rather than xchg\_local() makes sense given that
ipi\_message is not just accessed locally.
This moves the barrier between setting the message and calling the
cause\_ipi() function into the individual cause\_ipi implementations.
Most of them -- those that used outb, out\_8 or similar -- already had
a full barrier because out\_8 etc. include a sync before the MMIO
store. This adds an explicit barrier in the two remaining cases.
These changes made no measurable difference to the speed of IPIs as
measured using a simple ping-pong latency test across two CPUs on
different cores of a POWER7 machine.
The analysis of the reason why processes were not waking up properly
is due to Milton Miller.

powerpc: Restore correct DSCR in context switch
commit 714332858bfd40dcf8f741498336d93875c23aa7 upstream.
During a context switch we always restore the per thread DSCR value.
If we aren't doing explicit DSCR management
(ie thread.dscr\_inherit == 0) and the default DSCR changed while

Check thread.dscr\_inherit and select the default DSCR or per thread
DSCR as required.
This was found with the following test case, when running with
more threads than CPUs (ie forcing context switching):

powerpc: Update DSCR on all CPUs when writing sysfs dscr\_default
commit 1b6ca2a6fe56e7697d57348646e07df08f43b1bb upstream.
Writing to dscr\_default in sysfs doesn't actually change the DSCR -
we rely on a context switch on each CPU to do the work. There is no
guarantee we will get a context switch in a reasonable amount of time
so fire off an IPI to force an immediate change.
This issue was found with the following test case:

mmc: card: Skip secure erase on MoviNAND; causes unrecoverable corruption.
commit 3550ccdb9d8d350e526b809bf3dd92b550a74fe1 upstream.
For several MoviNAND eMMC parts, there are known issues with secure
erase and secure trim. For these specific MoviNAND devices, we skip
these operations.
Specifically, there is a bug in the eMMC firmware that causes
unrecoverable corruption when the MMC is erased with MMC\_CAP\_ERASE
enabled.

mmc: sdhci-esdhc: break out early if clock is 0
commit 74f330bceaa7b88d06062e1cac3d519a3dfc041e upstream.
Since commit 30832ab56 ("mmc: sdhci: Always pass clock request value
zero to set\_clock host op") was merged, esdhc\_set\_clock starts hitting
"if (clock == 0)" where ESDHC\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL has been operated. This
causes SDHCI card-detection function being broken. Fix the regression
by moving "if (clock == 0)" above ESDHC\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL operation.

UBI: fix a horrible memory deallocation bug
commit 78b495c39add820ab66ab897af9bd77a5f2e91f6 upstream.
UBI was mistakingly using 'kfree()' instead of 'kmem\_cache\_free()' when
freeing "attach eraseblock" structures in vtbl.c. Thankfully, this happened
only when we were doing auto-format, so many systems were unaffected. However,
there are still many users affected.
It is strange, but the system did not crash and nothing bad happened when
the SLUB memory allocator was used. However, in case of SLOB we observed an
crash right away.
This problem was introduced in 2.6.39 by commit
"6c1e875 UBI: add slab cache for ubi\_scan\_leb objects"
A note for stable trees:
Because variable were renamed, this won't cleanly apply to older kernels.
Changing names like this should help:
1. ai -> si
2. aeb\_slab\_cache -> seb\_slab\_cache
3. new\_aeb -> new\_seb

ext3: Fix fdatasync() for files with only i\_size changes
commit 156bddd8e505b295540f3ca0e27dda68cb0d49aa upstream.
Code tracking when transaction needs to be committed on fdatasync(2) forgets
to handle a situation when only inode's i\_size is changed. Thus in such
situations fdatasync(2) doesn't force transaction with new i\_size to disk
and that can result in wrong i\_size after a crash.
Fix the issue by updating inode's i\_datasync\_tid whenever its size is
updated.

e1000e: DoS while TSO enabled caused by link partner with small MSS
commit d821a4c4d11ad160925dab2bb009b8444beff484 upstream.
With a low enough MSS on the link partner and TSO enabled locally, the
networking stack can periodically send a very large (e.g. 64KB) TCP
message for which the driver will attempt to use more Tx descriptors than
are available by default in the Tx ring. This is due to a workaround in
the code that imposes a limit of only 4 MSS-sized segments per descriptor
which appears to be a carry-over from the older e1000 driver and may be
applicable only to some older PCI or PCIx parts which are not supported in
e1000e. When the driver gets a message that is too large to fit across the
configured number of Tx descriptors, it stops the upper stack from queueing
any more and gets stuck in this state. After a timeout, the upper stack
assumes the adapter is hung and calls the driver to reset it.
Remove the unnecessary limitation of using up to only 4 MSS-sized segments
per Tx descriptor, and put in a hard failure test to catch when attempting
to check for message sizes larger than would fit in the whole Tx ring.
Refactor the remaining logic that limits the size of data per Tx descriptor
from a seemingly arbitrary 8KB to a limit based on the dynamic size of the
Tx packet buffer as described in the hardware specification.
Also, fix the logic in the check for space in the Tx ring for the next
largest possible packet after the current one has been successfully queued
for transmit, and use the appropriate defines for default ring sizes in
e1000\_probe instead of magic values.
This issue goes back to the introduction of e1000e in 2.6.24 when it was
split off from e1000.

drm/radeon/atom: rework DIG modesetting on DCE3+
commit 8d1af57ae3c4458ed0de93ef97f388dd1b3239c7 upstream.
The ordering is important and the current drm code
wasn't cutting it for modern DIG encoders. We need
to have information about crtc before setting up
the encoders so I've shifted the ordering a bit.
Probably we'll need a full rework akin to danvet's
recent intel patchs. This patch fixes numerous
issues with DP bridge chips and makes link training
much more reliable.

Each of these error messages can be caused by a broken or malicious
userspace wanting to spam the dmesg with useless info. They're really
not worthy of DRM\_DEBUG statements either; those are generally only
useful during bringup of new hardware or versions, and ought to be

ARM: imx: select CPU\_FREQ\_TABLE when needed
commit f637c4c9405e21f44cf0045eaf77eddd3a79ca5a upstream.
The i.MX cpufreq implementation uses the CPU\_FREQ\_TABLE helpers,
so it needs to select that code to be built. This problem has
apparently existed since the i.MX cpufreq code was first merged
in v2.6.37.
Building IMX without CPU\_FREQ\_TABLE results in:

xen/setup: Fix one-off error when adding for-balloon PFNs to the P2M.
commit c96aae1f7f393387d160211f60398d58463a7e65 upstream.
When we are finished with return PFNs to the hypervisor, then
populate it back, and also mark the E820 MMIO and E820 gaps
as IDENTITY\_FRAMEs, we then call P2M to set areas that can
be used for ballooning. We were off by one, and ended up
over-writting a P2M entry that most likely was an IDENTITY\_FRAME.
For example:
1-1 mapping on 40000->40200
1-1 mapping on bc558->bc5ac
1-1 mapping on bc5b4->bc8c5
1-1 mapping on bc8c6->bcb7c
1-1 mapping on bcd00->100000
Released 614 pages of unused memory
Set 277889 page(s) to 1-1 mapping
Populating 40200-40466 pfn range: 614 pages added
=> here we set from 40466 up to bc559 P2M tree to be
INVALID\_P2M\_ENTRY. We should have done it up to bc558.
The end result is that if anybody is trying to construct
a PTE for PFN bc558 they end up with ~PAGE\_PRESENT.

ARM: imx6: spin the cpu until hardware takes it down
commit c944b0b9354ea06ffb0c8a7178949f1185f9f499 upstream.
Though commit 602bf40 (ARM: imx6: exit coherency when shutting down
a cpu) improves the stability of imx6q cpu hotplug a lot, there are
still hangs seen with a more stressful hotplug testing.
It's expected that once imx\_enable\_cpu(cpu, false) is called, the cpu
will be taken down by hardware immediately, and the code after that
will not get any chance to execute. However, this is not always the
case from the testing. The cpu could possibly be alive for a few
cycles before hardware actually takes it down. So rather than letting
cpu execute some code that could cause a hang in these cycles, let's
make the cpu spin there and wait for hardware to take it down.

Fix 'Device not ready' issue on mpt2sas
commit 14216561e164671ce147458653b1fea06a4ada1e upstream.
This is a particularly nasty SCSI ATA Translation Layer (SATL) problem.
SAT-2 says (section 8.12.2)
if the device is in the stopped state as the result of
processing a START STOP UNIT command (see 9.11), then the SATL
shall terminate the TEST UNIT READY command with CHECK CONDITION
status with the sense key set to NOT READY and the additional
sense code of LOGICAL UNIT NOT READY, INITIALIZING COMMAND
REQUIRED;
mpt2sas internal SATL seems to implement this. The result is very confusing
standby behaviour (using hdparm -y). If you suspend a drive and then send
another command, usually it wakes up. However, if the next command is a TEST
UNIT READY, the SATL sees that the drive is suspended and proceeds to follow
the SATL rules for this, returning NOT READY to all subsequent commands. This
means that the ordering of TEST UNIT READY is crucial: if you send TUR and
then a command, you get a NOT READY to both back. If you send a command and
then a TUR, you get GOOD status because the preceeding command woke the drive.
This bit us badly because

block: flush MEDIA\_CHANGE from drivers on close(2)
Changed our ordering on TEST UNIT READY commands meaning that SATA drives
connected to an mpt2sas now suspend and refuse to wake (because the mpt2sas
SATL sees the suspend \*before\* the drives get awoken by the next ATA command)
resulting in lots of failed commands.
The standard is completely nuts forcing this inconsistent behaviour, but we
have to work around it.
The fix for this is twofold:
1. Set the allow\_restart flag so we wake the drive when we see it has been
suspended
2. Return all TEST UNIT READY status directly to the mid layer without any
further error handling which prevents us causing error handling which
may offline the device just because of a media check TUR.

mpt2sas: Fix for Driver oops, when loading driver with max\_queue\_depth command line option to a very small value
commit 338b131a3269881c7431234855c93c219b0979b6 upstream.
If the specified max\_queue\_depth setting is less than the
expected number of internal commands, then driver will calculate
the queue depth size to a negitive number. This negitive number
is actually a very large number because variable is unsigned
16bit integer. So, the driver will ask for a very large amount of
memory for message frames and resulting into oops as memory
allocation routines will not able to handle such a large request.
So, in order to limit this kind of oops, The driver need to set
the max\_queue\_depth to a scsi mid layer's can\_queue value. Then
the overall message frames required for IO is minimum of either
(max\_queue\_depth plus internal commands) or the IOC global
credits.

ARM: OMAP2+: Fix dmtimer set source clock failure
commit 54f32a35f4d3a653a18a2c8c239f19ae060bd803 upstream.
Calling the dmtimer function omap\_dm\_timer\_set\_source() fails if following a
call to pm\_runtime\_put() to disable the timer. For example the following
sequence would fail to set the parent clock ...
omap\_dm\_timer\_stop(gptimer);
omap\_dm\_timer\_set\_source(gptimer, OMAP\_TIMER\_SRC\_32\_KHZ);
The following error message would be seen ...
omap\_dm\_timer\_set\_source: failed to set timer\_32k\_ck as parent
The problem is that, by design, pm\_runtime\_put() simply decrements the usage
count and returns before the timer has actually been disabled. Therefore,
setting the parent clock failed because the timer was still active when the
trying to set the parent clock. Setting a parent clock will fail if the clock
you are setting the parent of has a non-zero usage count. To ensure that this
does not fail use pm\_runtime\_put\_sync() when disabling the timer.
Note that this will not be seen on OMAP1 devices, because these devices do
not use the clock framework for dmtimers.

Dave Anglin says:

The above line contains two compound literals. It also uses a designated
initializer to initialize the field enabled. A compound literal is not a
constant expression.
The location of the above statement isn't fully clear, but if a compound
literal occurs outside the body of a function, the initializer list must
consist of constant expressions.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=850449#c0)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-21 15:28:07 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way Netlink messages without explicitly set SCM_CREDENTIALS were delivered. The kernel passes all-zero SCM_CREDENTIALS ancillary data to the receiver if the sender did not provide such data, instead of including the correct data from the peer (as it is the case with AF_UNIX). Programs that set SO_PASSCRED option on the Netlink socket and rely on SCM_CREDENTIALS for authentication might accept spoofed messages and perform privileged actions on behalf of the unprivileged attacker.  Introduced in: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=16e57262>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Pablo Neira Ayuso for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=850449#c1)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-21 15:30:14 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did not backport the commit that introduced this issue. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=850449#c4)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-22 07:13:44 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=commit;h=e0e3cea46d31d23dc40df0a49a7a2c04fe8edfea>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=850449#c6)  Petr Matousek    2012-08-22 07:16:48 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 850688](show_bug.cgi?id=850688 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-3520 kernel: af_netlink: invalid handling of SCM_CREDENTIALS passing [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=850449#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-12-04 19:58:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:1491 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1491.html>   ``` |  |

## Description

The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM\_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.

Subject: CVE-2012-3520 kernel: af_netlink: invalid handling of
 SCM_CREDENTIALS passing

A flaw was found in the way Netlink messages without explicitly set
SCM_CREDENTIALS were delivered. The kernel passes all-zero
SCM_CREDENTIALS ancillary data to the receiver if the sender did not
provide such data, instead of including the correct data from the peer
(as it is the case with AF_UNIX). Programs that set SO_PASSCRED option
on the Netlink socket and rely on SCM_CREDENTIALS for authentication
might accept spoofed messages and perform privileged actions on behalf
of the unprivileged attacker.

```
Pablo Neira Ayuso discovered that avahi and
potentially NetworkManager accept spoofed Netlink messages because of a
kernel bug.  The kernel passes all-zero SCM_CREDENTIALS ancillary data
to the receiver if the sender did not provide such data, instead of not
including any such data at all or including the correct data from the
peer (as it is the case with AF_UNIX).

This bug was introduced in commit [16e5726](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/16e5726269611b71c930054ffe9b858c1cea88eb)
(af_unix: dont send SCM_CREDENTIALS by default)

This patch forces passing credentials for netlink, as
before the regression.

Another fix would be to not add SCM_CREDENTIALS in
netlink messages if not provided by the sender, but it
might break some programs.

With help from Florian Weimer & Petr Matousek

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-32-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-32.51)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-32-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-32.51)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-32-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)

  [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-32.51)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-32-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-32.51)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-32-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-32.51)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-32-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-32.51)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-32-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-32.51)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - January 2016

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - January 2016

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated for the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017

# USN-1599-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerability

9 October 2012

The system could be made to run actions or potentially programs as an
administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Pablo Neira Ayuso discovered a flaw in the credentials of netlink messages.

An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this by getting a netlink

based service, that relies on netlink credentials, to perform privileged

actions. ([CVE-2012-3520](/security/CVE-2012-3520))

Mathias Krause discovered information leak in the Linux kernel's compat

ioctl interface. A local user could exploit the flaw to examine parts of

kernel stack memory ([CVE-2012-6539](/security/CVE-2012-6539))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's

getsockopt for IP\_VS\_SO\_GET\_TIMEOUT. A local user could exploit this flaw

to examine parts of kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6540](/security/CVE-2012-6540))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's

getsockopt implementation for the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol

(DCCP). A local user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the

kernel's stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6541](/security/CVE-2012-6541))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's

getsockname implementation for Logical Link Layer (llc) sockets. A local

user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the kernel's stack memory.

([CVE-2012-6542](/security/CVE-2012-6542))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth

Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) implementation. A

local user could exploit these flaws to examine some of the kernel's stack

memory. ([CVE-2012-6544](/security/CVE-2012-6544))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth

RFCOMM protocol implementation. A local user could exploit these flaws to

examine parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6545](/security/CVE-2012-6545))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel's

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking stack. A local user could

exploit these flaws to examine some parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6546](/security/CVE-2012-6546))

A flaw was discovered in how netlink sockets validate message origins. A

local attacker could exploit this flaw to send netlink message

notifications, with spoofed credentials, to subscribed tasks.

([CVE-2012-6689](/security/CVE-2012-6689))

Mathias Krause discover an error in Linux kernel's Datagram Congestion

Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control Identifier (CCID) use. A local

attack could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) and

potentially escalate privileges if the user can mmap page 0.

([CVE-2013-1827](/security/CVE-2013-1827))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1420-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1420.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1420.27)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
