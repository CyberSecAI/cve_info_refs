      "root_cause": "The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel passes all-zero SCM_CREDENTIALS ancillary data to the receiver if the sender did not provide such data, instead of not including any such data or including the correct data from the peer. This behavior was introduced by commit 16e572626961.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper handling of SCM_CREDENTIALS in Netlink messages.",
         "Kernel passes all-zero SCM_CREDENTIALS when no credentials are provided"
      ],
      "impact": "An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this by getting a netlink based service, that relies on netlink credentials, to perform privileged actions. It allows local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager. Programs that set SO_PASSCRED option on the Netlink socket and rely on SCM_CREDENTIALS for authentication might accept spoofed messages and perform privileged actions on behalf of the unprivileged attacker.",

         "Local attack through crafted Netlink messages."

      "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to craft and send Netlink messages to a vulnerable service.",
    "additional_notes":"The provided information indicates that the vulnerability allows for local privilege escalation due to the improper handling of credentials and also impacts services that rely on these credentials for authentication. The fix involves forcing the passing of credentials for netlink. The vulnerability was introduced by commit 16e572626961 and fixed by commit e0e3cea46d31"
