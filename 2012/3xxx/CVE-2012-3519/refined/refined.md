Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2012-3519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a timing side-channel in the Tor client's router selection process. The client iterates through a list of available relays and stops as soon as it has chosen one. This causes the selection process to finish earlier if the chosen router is located earlier in the list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Timing Side-Channel:** The primary weakness is the exploitable timing difference based on the position of the selected router in the list.
-   **Information Leakage:** The timing difference has the potential to leak information about the chosen relays.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Path Information Leakage:** An attacker who can accurately measure the time taken to select a route, could learn which relays a client is picking (especially the middle nodes).
-   **Coarse-grained Information:** The leaked information might not reveal the exact nodes chosen, but it could reveal which segment of the node list the chosen node belongs to.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Side-Channel Timing Analysis:** An attacker needs to observe the timing of the Tor client's router selection process. This could potentially be done by observing network traffic, though the information might be noisy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Network Observer:** The attacker would need to be in a position to observe and measure the timing of network communications of the Tor client during router selection.
-   **Timing Analysis Capabilities:** The attacker would need the capability to analyze the timing information accurately to discern the leaked details.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability is considered "not end-of-the-world" because the timing information is likely to be noisy, the timing isn't fine-grained enough to leak specific nodes and the exit nodes are selected before any data is sent over the network.
-   The vulnerability was fixed in Tor version 0.2.2.38.
