Vulnerable ProductsCisco TelePresence Manager, Cisco TelePresence Recording Server, Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch, and Cisco TelePresence Immersive Endpoint System may be affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this security advisory. The following tables contain specific information for each vulnerability.      **Cisco TelePresence API Remote Command Injection Vulnerability**      | Product | Affected |   | --- | --- |   | Cisco TelePresence Manager | NO |   | Cisco TelePresence Recording Server | NO |   | Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch | NO |   | Cisco TelePresence Immersive Endpoint System | YES |      **Cisco TelePresence Remote Command Injection Vulnerability**      | Product | Affected |   | --- | --- |   | Cisco TelePresence Manager | NO |   | Cisco TelePresence Recording Server | NO |   | Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch | NO |   | Cisco TelePresence Immersive Endpoint System | YES |         **Cisco TelePresence Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**       | Product | Affected |   | --- | --- |   | Cisco TelePresence Manager | YES |   | Cisco TelePresence Recording Server | YES |   | Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch | YES |   | Cisco TelePresence Immersive Endpoint System | YES |         Detailed Information about Vulnerable ProductThis security advisory is describing the vulnerabilities for the Cisco TelePresence Endpoint devices. For additional information regarding how the vulnerabilities affect other vulnerable products please refer to the specific product security advisory document following the link in the table below:       | Product | Security Advisory Publication Link |   | --- | --- |   | Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Switch | https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120711-ctms |   | Cisco TelePresence Manager | https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120711-ctsman |   | Cisco TelePresence Recording Server | https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120711-ctrs |      How To Determine The Software Version Cisco TelePresence Recording Server devices that are running an affected version of software are affected.  To determine the current version of software that is running on Cisco TelePresence Endpoint Systems, establish an SSH connection to the device and issue the **show version active** and the **show version inactive** commands. The output should resemble the following example:  ```   admin: show version active   Active Master Version: 1.7.0.0-471      Active Version Installed Software Options:    No Installed Software Options Found.      admin: show version inactive   Inactive Master Version: 1.6.0.0-342      Inactive Version Installed Software Options:    No Installed Software Options Found.   ```  In the preceding example, the system has versions 1.6.0 and 1.7.0 loaded on the device, and version 1.7.0 is currently active. A device is affected only by vulnerabilities that are in the active software version. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco TelePresence Endpoint devices provide an immersive remote presence experience.      This section gives additional information for each of the vulnerabilities affecting Cisco TelePresence Immersive Endpoint Devices.      **Cisco TelePresence API Remote Command Execution Vulnerability**      A remote command injection vulnerability exists in one of the Cisco TelePresence APIs that are hosted on the immersive endpoint devices. This issue if exploited could allow an unauthenticated attacker in an adjacent context to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.      An attacker must have the ability to submit a malformed request to TCP port 61460 from a physical or logical Layer 3 adjacent context. A three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtz38382](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz38382) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-3074.      **Cisco TelePresence Remote Command Execution Vulnerability**   A remote command injection vulnerability exists in the Cisco TelePresence administrative web interface that is hosted on the immersive endpoint devices. If exploited, this issue could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.      An attacker must have the ability to submit a malformed request to TCP port 443. A three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtn99724](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtn99724) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-3075.         **Cisco TelePresence Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**       A remote code execution vulnerability in the implementation of the Cisco   Discovery Protocol component could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent   attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The   vulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle malformed Cisco   Discovery Protocol packets. An attacker could exploit this   vulnerability by passing malformed Cisco   Discovery Protocol packets to an   affected device. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the   attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.      Because Cisco Discovery Protocol works at the data link layer (Layer 2),   an attacker must have a way to submit an Ethernet frame directly to an   affected device. This action may be possible in situations where the affected   system is part of a bridged network or connected to a non partitioned   device, such as a network hub.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtz40953](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz40953) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-2486.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.4 |
