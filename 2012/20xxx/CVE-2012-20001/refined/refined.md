{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application's `isCleanHtml()` function, intended to sanitize HTML input, can be bypassed using crafted payloads, specifically utilizing `<object>` and `<embed>` tags with `data:` URLs containing base64-encoded JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Improper filtering of HTML elements",
      "Use of vulnerable sanitization function (isCleanHtml())"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the administrator's session when they view the contact form messages. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or further malicious activity.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A user submits a message via the contact form, which contains a malicious payload.",
        "The malicious payload is stored and executed when the administrator views the message."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker only needs to be able to submit a contact form to trigger the persistent XSS vulnerability. No authentication is required for the initial attack."
