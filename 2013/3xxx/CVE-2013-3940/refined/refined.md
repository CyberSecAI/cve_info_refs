Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3940:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) when processing specially crafted image files within Windows Write (.wri) files opened in WordPad. Specifically, the GDI improperly handles integer calculations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is an integer overflow within the GDI when parsing image data embedded in .wri files.
- **Memory Corruption:** This integer overflow leads to memory corruption, allowing for further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gains the same user rights as the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted .wri file via email and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker can host a website with a malicious .wri file, or inject such files into compromised websites. The attacker would then need to convince the victim to visit the site and open the file.
- **Watering Hole Attack:** As noted by US-CERT, a watering hole attack, where a compromised website targeting a specific audience, was used to deliver the exploit for this and other vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted Windows Write (.wri) file with a malicious image that triggers the integer overflow.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice the user to open the malicious file, either through email or by visiting a malicious website.
- **No Special Network Access Needed:** The attacker does not require any special network access or privileges on the victim machine before the vulnerability is triggered.
