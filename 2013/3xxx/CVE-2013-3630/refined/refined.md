Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-3630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a **post-authentication host OS command execution** issue found in the Moodle application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The application allows a logged-in user to execute operating system commands on the host.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system with the same privileges as the Moodle webserver process. This could lead to a full compromise of the server, data breaches, or the establishment of a foothold in the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the web application interface.
*   The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the application first.
*   Once logged in, the attacker could use the functionality which allows arbitrary command execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs valid credentials (username and password) to log in to the Moodle web application.
*   The attacker must be able to interact with the web interface of the Moodle application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered during an assessment of popular open-source enterprise applications on SourceForge.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Moodle, but was classified as "wontfix", suggesting that the functionality may be by design or not considered a security vulnerability by the developers,
*   A Metasploit module was created to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The same researcher found similar vulnerabilities in other FOSS software.
*   The blog post also describes the difficult process of disclosing vulnerabilities to different open source software developers
