CVE Name: CVE-2013-3077
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
0. Revision History
v1.0 2013-08-22 Initial release.
v1.1 2013-09-07 Binary patch released for 9.2-RC1.
I. Background
IP multicast is a method of sending Internet Protocol (IP) datagrams to a
group of interested receivers in a single transmission.
II. Problem Description
An integer overflow in computing the size of a temporary buffer can
result in a buffer which is too small for the requested operation.
III. Impact
An unprivileged process can read or write pages of memory which belong to
the kernel. These may lead to exposure of sensitive information or allow
privilege escalation.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:09/ip\_multicast.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:09/ip\_multicast.patch.asc
# gpg --verify ip\_multicast.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
