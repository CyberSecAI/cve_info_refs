## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework and Silverlight Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2861561)

Published: July 09, 2013 | Updated: August 13, 2013

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves five privately reported vulnerabilities and two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a trusted application uses a particular pattern of code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 Service Pack 3, Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1, and .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1, and rated Critical for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, Microsoft .NET Framework 4, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 on affected editions of Microsoft Windows. The update is also rated Important for affected editions of Microsoft Silverlight 5.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows handles specially crafted TrueType Font (TTF) files, and by correcting how the .NET Framework handles multidimensional arrays of small structures, validates the permissions of objects performing reflection, allocates object arrays, and handles partial trust vulnerabilities, and initializes memory arrays. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**Â Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

* Microsoft Windows Components (MS13-054)
* Microsoft Office (MS13-054)
* Microsoft Lync (MS13-054)
* Microsoft Visual Studio (MS13-054)
* Microsoft Windows Kernel-Mode Driver (MS13-053)
* Microsoft .NET Framework (MS13-052)
* Microsoft Silverlight (MS13-052)

You need to install only the updates that correspond to the software you have installed on your systems. If you need to install more than one of these updates, they can be installed in any sequence.

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912.aspx).

**There are multiple update packages available for** **some of the affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for a given system can be applied in any sequence.

**What is Microsoft Silverlight?**

Microsoft Silverlight is a cross-browser, cross-platform implementation of the Microsoft .NET Framework for building media experiences and rich interactive applications for the web. For more information, see the official site of [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/).

**Which web browsers support Microsoft Silverlight applications?**

In order to run Microsoft Silverlight applications, most web browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, require Microsoft Silverlight to be installed and the corresponding plug-in to be enabled. For more information about Microsoft Silverlight, see the official site, [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/). Please refer to the documentation of your browser to learn more about how to disable or remove plug-ins.

**What versions of Microsoft Silverlight 5 are affected by the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Silverlight build 5.1.20513.0, which was the current build of Microsoft Silverlight as of when this bulletin was first released, addresses the vulnerability and is not affected. Builds of Microsoft Silverlight previous to 5.1.20513.0 are affected.

**How do I know which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight is currently installed on my system?**

If Microsoft Silverlight is already installed on your computer, you can visit the [Get Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight) page, which will indicate which version and build of Microsoft Silverlight is currently installed on your system. Alternatively, you can use the Manage Add-Ons feature of current versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer to determine the version and build information that is currently installed on your system.

You can also manually check the version number of sllauncher.exe located in the "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Silverlight" directory (on x86 Microsoft Windows systems) or in the "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Silverlight" directory (on x64 Microsoft Windows systems).

In addition, on Microsoft Windows, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found in the registry at [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x86 Microsoft Windows systems, or [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Silverlight]:Version on x64 Microsoft Windows systems.

On Apple Mac OS, the version and build information of the currently installed version of Microsoft Silverlight can be found as follows:

1. Open the **Finder**
2. Select the system drive and go to the folder **Internet Plug-ins - Library**
3. Right-click the file **Silverlight.Plugin** (if your mouse has only one button, press the **Ctrl** key while clicking on the file) to bring up the context menu, then click **Show Package Contents**
4. Inside the contents folder, locate the file **info.plist** and open it with an editor. It will contain an entry like this, which shows you the version number:

   SilverlightVersion

   5.1.20513.0

The version installed with this security update for Microsoft Silverlight is 5.1.20513.0. If your Microsoft Silverlight 5 version number is higher than or equal to this version number, your system is not vulnerable.

**How do I upgrade my version of Microsoft Silverlight?**

The Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature helps make sure that your Microsoft Silverlight installation is kept up to date with the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight, Microsoft Silverlight functionality, and security features. For more information about the Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature, see the [Microsoft Silverlight Updater](https://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/resources/documentation/updater.aspx). Windows users who have disabled the Microsoft Silverlight auto-update feature can enroll in [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) to obtain the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight, or can download the latest version of Microsoft Silverlight manually using the download link in the Affected Software table in the earlier section, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**. For information about deploying Microsoft Silverlight in an enterprise environment, see the [Silverlight Enterprise Deployment Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=119611).

**Will this update upgrade my version of Silverlight?**

The 2847559 update upgrades previous versions of Silverlight to Silverlight version 5.1.20513.0. Microsoft recommends upgrading to be protected against the vulnerability described in this bulletin.

**Where can I find additional information about the Silverlight product lifecycle?**

For lifecycle information specific to Silverlight, see the [Microsoft Silverlight Support Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifean45).

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework improperly handles multidimensional arrays of small structures.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In a .NET application attack scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In a web-browsing scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on behalf of the targeted user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a .NET application attack scenario, an attacker could modify the array data in a manner that would allow for remote code execution.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted Silverlight application designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating Silverlight applications. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What is Microsoft Silverlight?**

Microsoft Silverlight is a cross-browser, cross-platform implementation of the Microsoft .NET Framework for building media experiences and rich interactive applications for the web. For more information, see the official site of [Microsoft Silverlight](https://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/).

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2012. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3132](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3132).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, XBAP applications prompt the user before executing code.
* By default, Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 prevent XAML, which is used by XBAPs, from running in the Internet Zone.
* By default, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 are configured to prompt the user before running XAML, which is used by XBAPs, in the Internet Zone.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/enhanced%2520security%2520configuration%28v%3DSecurity.10%29). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict websites to only your trusted websites**

  As a workaround for this issue, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted Zone, after disabling Active Scripting in the Internet Zone. This will allow you to continue using trusted web sites exactly as you do today, while tightening the restrictions on untrusted sites. When you are able to deploy the patch, you'll be able to re-enable Active Scripting in the Internet Zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then click **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab and then, in the area labeled **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings**, click **Trusted Sites**.
  3. Click **Sites** and then add the sites that don't require a secure connection by doing the following:

     + De-select the checkbox labeled **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone**.
     + In the area labeled **Add this Web Site to the zone:**, type the URL of a site that you trust, then click the **Add** button.
     + Repeat for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  4. Click **OK** twice to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is [https://windowsupdate.microsoft.com](https://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/). This is the site that hosts the patch, and it requires Active Scripting in order to install the patch. Note that there's generally a trade-off between ease-of-use and security; by selecting a high-security configuration, you could make it extremely unlikely that a malicious web site could take action against you, but at the cost of missing a lot of rich functionality. The appropriate balance between security and ease-of-use is different for everyone, and you should pick a configuration that fits your needs. The good news is that it's easy to change your configuration, and you can try different configurations until you find the right one for you until you can install the patch.
* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  3. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XAML browser applications**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XPS documents**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. On the **Security** tab, click **Custom level**. Under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, set **Run components not signed with Authenticode** to either **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework improperly validates the permissions of objects performing reflection.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are two attack scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability: a web browsing scenario and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions scenario. These scenarios are described as follows:

* **Web browsing attack scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.
* **Windows .NET applications attack scenario**

  This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET Framework applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a web application and a rich-client application. Like web applications, XBAPs can be published to a web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What are .NET Framework Code Access Security (CAS) Restrictions?**

The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security. Code access security (CAS) enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity. Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run. Using code access security can reduce the likelihood that your code will be misused by malicious or error-filled code. For more information on CAS, see the MSDN article, [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described as follows: systems that are using the web browsing scenario and systems that are using the Windows .NET Framework applications scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Windows .NET applications**

  Workstations and servers that run untrusted Windows .NET Framework applications are also at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Framework validates the permissions of objects performing reflection.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Anonymous Method Injection Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3133

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the .NET Framework validates permissions for objects involved with reflection.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3133](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3133).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, Internet Explorer 9 and Internet Explorer 10 prevent XAML, which is used by XBAPs, from running in the Internet Zone.
* By default, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 are configured to prompt the user before running XAML, which is used by XBAPs, in the Internet Zone.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/enhanced%2520security%2520configuration%28v%3DSecurity.10%29). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict websites to only your trusted websites**

  As a workaround for this issue, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted Zone, after disabling Active Scripting in the Internet Zone. This will allow you to continue using trusted web sites exactly as you do today, while tightening the restrictions on untrusted sites. When you are able to deploy the patch, you'll be able to re-enable Active Scripting in the Internet Zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then click **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab and then, in the area labeled **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings**, click **Trusted Sites**.
  3. Click **Sites** and then add the sites that don't require a secure connection by doing the following:

     + De-select the checkbox labeled **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone**.
     + In the area labeled **Add this Web Site to the zone:**, type the URL of a site that you trust, then click the **Add** button.
     + Repeat for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  4. Click **OK** twice to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is [https://windowsupdate.microsoft.com](https://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/). This is the site that hosts the patch, and it requires Active Scripting in order to install the patch. Note that there's generally a trade-off between ease-of-use and security; by selecting a high-security configuration, you could make it extremely unlikely that a malicious web site could take action against you, but at the cost of missing a lot of rich functionality. The appropriate balance between security and ease-of-use is different for everyone, and you should pick a configuration that fits your needs. The good news is that it's easy to change your configuration, and you can try different configurations until you find the right one for you until you can install the patch.
* **Disable XAML browser applications in Internet Explorer**

  To help protect against this vulnerability, change your settings to prompt before running XAML browser applications (XBAPs) or to disable XBAPs in the Internet and Local intranet security zones as follows:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click the **Tools** menu and then select **Internet Options**.
  2. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **Loose XAML**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  3. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XAML browser applications**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Click the **Security** tab, click **Internet**, and then click **Custom level**. Under **Settings**, for **XPS documents**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. On the **Security** tab, click **Custom level**. Under **.NET Framework-reliant components**, set **Run components not signed with Authenticode** to either **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**. Repeat this step for **Run components signed with Authenticode**, and then click **OK**.
  6. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**. Repeat steps 3 and 4. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to change these settings, click **Yes**. Click **OK** to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Microsoft .NET code will not run in Internet Explorer or will not run without prompting. Disabling Microsoft .NET applications and components in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework improperly validates the permissions of objects involved with reflection.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In the web browsing scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the currently logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are two attack scenarios possible for exploiting this vulnerability: a web browsing scenario and a Windows .NET application bypass of Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions scenario. These scenarios are described as follows:

* **Web browsing attack scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible to display specially crafted web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.
* **Windows .NET applications attack scenario**

  This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET Framework applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions.

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a web application and a rich-client application. Like web applications, XBAPs can be published to a web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What are .NET Framework Code Access Security (CAS) Restrictions?**

The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security. Code access security (CAS) enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity. Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run. Using code access security can reduce the likelihood that your code will be misused by malicious or error-filled code. For more information on CAS, see the MSDN article, [Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**
