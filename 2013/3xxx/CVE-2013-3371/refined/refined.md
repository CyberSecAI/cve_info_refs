Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2013-3371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied data in two specific contexts:
    -  Cross-site scripting (XSS) via attachment filenames in RT 3.8.3 and above.
    -  Cross-site scripting (XSS) via maliciously crafted URLs in ticket content when RT's "MakeClicky" feature is enabled in RT 4.0.0 and above.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to lack of proper input sanitization of user-provided data.
-  Insecure handling of attachment filenames and ticket content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser when viewing attachments or ticket content. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session

**Attack Vectors:**
-  For the attachment filename vulnerability: An attacker would need to upload an attachment with a maliciously crafted filename.
-  For the "MakeClicky" feature vulnerability: An attacker would need to insert a maliciously crafted URL into the ticket content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  For the attachment filename vulnerability: The attacker would need to be a user capable of uploading attachments to the RT system.
-  For the "MakeClicky" feature vulnerability: The attacker would need to be able to create or modify ticket content.
- The attacker needs to have a valid account on the RT system to perform the actions.
- No specific administrative rights are required for successful exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability related to attachment filenames is described as "difficult to exploit due to parsing requirements."
- Although the "MakeClicky" vulnerability is not believed to be exploitable in the stock configuration, a patch was included for RTIR 2.6.x for "bulletproofing".
- The content states that the vulnerabilities are resolved in RT versions 3.8.17 and 4.0.13.
