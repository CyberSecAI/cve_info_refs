In the first stage, transaction inputs are fetched.This is done by bringing to RAM the transactions that contains the outputs referred by the inputs.In the second stage, previous outputs are verified to be unspent and the related scripts are evaluated.Since double spends are not considered to be a DoS attempt by the protocol rules, a transaction that refers to previous spent outputs will pass the first processing stage without being discarded. An attacker can therefore construct transactions that, before being discarded in the second stage of processing, require the victim application to seek and read too many parts of the block chain that could be scattered thought the storage files, delaying any other processing.**Details**We assume that the whole block chain does not fit in RAM, so each transaction fetch requires a HD seek and read. An average 7200 rpm hard drivecan random seek/read a 1Kb block in a non-cached 2 Gb file in 12 msec. Each prevout of a transaction consumes 44 bytes, with empty sigscripts.The attacker creates transaction with many inputs an one output. In this way, the other sections of the transaction (output scripts, headers) are amortized and become irrelevant to this analysis.For an Internet connection of 50 Kbytes/sec bandwidth, sending 45 bytes requires less than 1 msec.By continuously sending this specially crafted transactions an attacker can block any Bitcoin peer from performing other tasks.Also the attacker may be able to block 10 peers at the same time, since the relation of 1:10 in required resources.Note that the attacker does not need to sign the inputs nor to have the full block-chain to perform the attack. He only requires the hashes of all previous transactions, which currently requires only 10876856\*32=332 Mbytes of storage.Version 0.8.0 of the Satoshi client stores only unspent prevouts in memory and can abort processing right after a spent prevout is referred by a transaction.**Possible Attack Scenarios**1. Because of the small resources required to mount the attack, it could be performed by botnets to massively attack the Bitcoin network.2. The attack can be used against miners to prevent them from sending blocks. Nevertheless, currently big miners are ony connected  to there own front-line of Bitcoin nodes to preven such attacks.3. By using many nodes at once, an attacker may try to create a barrier that splits the network in unconnected components, in order to carry another kind of attack.**Not-a-problem variations**1. A valid 1M transaction could be constructed to reference more than 22K unique input transactions. In theory that transaction would take more than 5 minutes to be verified. Nevertheless the attack is unpractical for two reasons: a. The attacker should have to own those 22K transactions. b. Those 22K transactions should have to be  scatterer thought the blockchain to force HD seeking activity. If they were created in a limited period of time, they would end up confined in a limited portion of the block chain file. The result would be that the hard disk cache will help to reduce the read latency and so attack effectiveness will be reduced. Nevertheless version 0.8.0 of the Satoshi client considers transactions greater that 100K to be non-standard, so the vulnerability is further reduced. **Suggested Solution for 0.6/0.7 versions**The client application could verify that prevouts are not spent each time they are fetched, and abort if a spent prevout is found.bool CTransaction::FetchInputs(CTxDB& txdb, const map<uint256, CTxIndex>& mapTestPool,                               bool fBlock, bool fMiner, MapPrevTx& inputsRet, bool& fInvalid){  .. for (unsigned int i = 0; i < vin.size(); i++)    {    // Read txPrev    CTransaction& txPrev = inputsRet[prevout.hash].second;    ....   // NEW CODE BEGINS    if (prevout.n >= txPrev.vout.size() || prevout.n >= txindex.vSpent.size())        {        fInvalid = true;                return DoS(100, error(" .....      }    if (!txindex.vSpent[prevout.n].IsNull())     return false;   // NEW CODE ENDS   }}**Disclosure Timeline**2013-01-09 - Vulnerability reported to Gavin Andressen and other core devs.2013-01-09 - Gavin Andressen aknowledges report and confirms version 0.8 will not be vulnerable, permits disclosure after 0.8.0 release candidate 1 is available.2013-02-09 - Bitcoin version 0.8.0 release candidate 1 is available, fixing the vulnerability2013-02-14 - Vulnerability disclosure**Credit**This vulnerability was discovered by Sergio Demian Lerner, from Certimix.comThis report was written by SDL.Disclaimer: I haven't tested the attack with exploit code, but it seems to be real and practical. | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One caused bitcoin to crash on some machines when processing a transaction containing an OP\_LSHIFT. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

After these bugs were discovered, many currently-unused script words were disabled for safety.

On July 28 2010, two bugs were discovered and demonstrated on the test network. One exploited a bug in the transaction handling code and allowed an attacker to spend coins that they did not own. This was never exploited on the main network, and was fixed by Bitcoin version 0.3.5.

On July 29 2010, it was discovered that block [71036](http://blockexplorer.com/block/00000000000997f9fd2fe1ee376293ef8c42ad09193a5d2086dddf8e5c426b56) contained several transactions with a ton of OP\_CHECKSIG commands. There should only ever be one such command. This caused every node to do extra unnecessary work, and it could have been used as a denial-of-service attack. A new version of Bitcoin was quickly released. The new version did not cause a fork on the main network, though it did cause one on the test network (where someone had played around with the attack more).

On August 15 2010, it was [discovered](http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822.0) that block 74638 contained a transaction that created over 184 billion bitcoins for two different addresses. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed. A new version was published within a few hours of the discovery. The block chain had to be forked. Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height of 74691. The bad transaction no longer exists for people using the longest chain.

The block and transaction:

```

Summary: Never confirming transactions

Around September 29, 2010, people started [reporting](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.0) that their sent transactions would not confirm. This happened because people modified Bitcoin to send sub-0.01 transactions without any fees. A 0.01 fee was at that time required by the network for such transactions (essentially prohibiting them), so the transactions remained at 0 confirmations forever. This became a more serious issue because Bitcoin would send transactions using bitcoins gotten from transactions with 0 confirmations, and these resulting transactions would also never confirm. Because Bitcoin tends to prefer sending smaller coins, these invalid transactions quickly multiplied, contaminating the wallets of everyone who received them.

Bitcoin was changed to only select coins with at least 1 confirmation. The remaining sub-0.01 transactions were cleared by generators who modified their version of Bitcoin to not require the micropayment fee. It took a while for everything to get cleared, though, because many of the intermediate transactions had been forgotten by the network by this point and had to be rebroadcast by the original senders.

Block hash collisions can easily be made by duplicating transactions in the merkle tree.
Such a collision is invalid, but if recorded (as Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind prior to 0.6.1 did) would prevent acceptance of the legitimate block with the same hash.
This could be used to fork the blockchain, including deep double-spend attacks.

## What went wrong

A block that had a larger number of total transaction inputs than previously seen was mined and broadcasted. Bitcoin 0.8 nodes were able to handle this, but some pre-0.8 Bitcoin nodes rejected it, causing an unexpected fork of the blockchain. The pre-0.8-incompatible chain (from here on, the 0.8 chain) at that point had around 60% of the mining hash power ensuring the split did not automatically resolve (as would have occurred if the pre-0.8 chain outpaced the 0.8 chain in total work, forcing 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain).

In order to restore a canonical chain as soon as possible, BTCGuild and Slush downgraded their Bitcoin 0.8 nodes to 0.7 so their pools would also reject the larger block. This placed majority hashpower on the chain without the larger block, thus eventually causing the 0.8 nodes to reorganise to the pre-0.8 chain.

During this time there was at least [one large double spend](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=152348.0). However, it was done by someone experimenting to see if it was possible and was not intended to be malicious.

## What went right

* The split was detected very quickly.
* The right people were online and available in IRC or could be contacted directly.
* Marek Palatinus (Slush) and Michael Marsee (Eleuthria of BTCGuild) quickly downgraded their nodes to restore a pre-0.8 chain as canonical, despite the fact that this caused them to sacrifice significant amounts of money.
* Deposits to the major exchanges and payments via BitPay were also suspended (and then un-suspended) very quickly.
* Fortunately, the only attack on a merchant was done by someone who was not intending to actually steal money.

## Root cause

Bitcoin versions prior to 0.8 configure an insufficient number of Berkeley DB locks to process large but otherwise valid blocks. Berkeley DB locks have to be manually configured by API users depending on anticipated load. The manual says this:

The recommended algorithm for selecting the maximum number of locks, lockers, and lock objects is to run the application under stressful conditions and then review the lock system's statistics to determine the maximum number of locks, lockers, and lock objects that were used. Then, double these values for safety.

With the insufficiently high BDB lock configuration, it implicitly had become a network consensus rule determining block validity (albeit an inconsistent and unsafe rule, since the lock usage could vary from node to node).

Because max-sized blocks had been successfully processed on the testnet, it did not occur to anyone that there could be blocks that were smaller but require more locks than were available. Prior to 0.7 unmodified mining nodes self-imposed a maximum block size of 500,000 bytes, which further prevented this case from being triggered. 0.7 made the target size configurable and miners had been encouraged to increase this target in the week prior to the incident.

Bitcoin 0.8 did not use Berkeley DB. It switched to LevelDB instead, which did not implement the same locking limits as BDB. Therefore it was able to process the forking block successfully.

Note that BDB locks are also required during processing of re-organizations. Versions prior to 0.8 may be unable to process some valid re-orgs.

This would be an issue even if the entire network was running version 0.7.2. It is theoretically possible for one 0.7.2 node to create a block that others are unable to validate, or for 0.7.2 nodes to create block re-orgs that peers cannot validate, because the contents of each node's blkindex.dat database is not identical, and the number of locks required depends on the exact arrangement of the blkindex.dat on disk (locks are acquired per-page).

## Action items

### Immediately

**Done**: Release a version 0.8.1, forked directly from 0.8.0, that, for the next two months has the following new rules:

1. Reject blocks that would probably cause more than 10,000 locks to be taken.
2. Limit the maximum block-size created to 500,000 bytes
3. Release a patch for older versions that implements the same rules, but also increases the maximum number of locks to 537,000
4. Create a web page on bitcoin.org that will urge users to upgrade to 0.8.1, but will tell them how to set DB\_CONFIG to 537,000 locks if they absolutely cannot.
5. Over the next 2 months, send a series of alerts to users of older versions, pointing to the web page.

### Alert system

**Done**: Review who has access to the alert system keys, make sure they all have contact information for each other, and get good timezone overlap by people with access to the keys.

**Done**: Implement a new bitcoind feature so services can get timely notification of alerts: -alertnotify=<command> Run command when an AppliesToMe() alert is received.

**Done**: Pre-generate 52 test alerts, and set a time every week when they are broadcast on -testnet (so -alertnotify scripts can be tested in as-close-to-real-world conditions as possible).

Idea from Michael Gronager: encourage merchants/exchanges (and maybe pools) to run new code behind a bitcoind running the network-majority version.

### Safe mode

**Done**: Perhaps trigger an alert if there is a long enough side chain detected, even if it is not the main chain. Pools could use this to automatically suspend payouts if a long side-chain suddenly appeared out of nowhere (it’s hard for an attacker to mine such a thing).

### Testing

Start running bots on the testnet that grab some coins from a testnet faucet, generate large numbers of random transactions that split/recombine them and then send them back to the faucet. Randomized online testing on the testnet might have revealed the pathological block type earlier.

### Double spending

A double spend attack was successful, despite that both sides of the chain heard about the transactions in the same order. The reason is most likely that the memory pools were cleared when the mining pool nodes were downgraded. A solution is for nodes to sync their mempools to each other at startup, however, this requires a memory pool expiry policy to be implemented as currently node restarts are the only way for unconfirmed transactions to be evicted from the system.

### Resolution

On 16 August, 2013 block 252,451 (0x0000000000000024b58eeb1134432f00497a6a860412996e7a260f47126eed07) was accepted by the main network, forking unpatched nodes off the network.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-03-17 14:13:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2013-2273 <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2273> :  bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.4.9rc1, 0.5.x before 0.5.8rc1, 0.6.0 before 0.6.0.11rc1, 0.6.1 through 0.6.5 before 0.6.5rc1, and 0.7.x before 0.7.3rc1 make it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information about returned change by leveraging certain predictability in the outputs of a Bitcoin transaction.   CVE-2013-2292 <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2292> :  bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (electricity consumption) by mining a block to create a nonstandard Bitcoin transaction containing multiple OP_CHECKSIG script opcodes.   CVE-2013-2293 <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-2293> :  The CTransaction::FetchInputs method in bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.8.0rc1 copies transactions from disk to memory without incrementally checking for spent prevouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disk I/O consumption) via a Bitcoin transaction with many inputs corresponding to many different parts of the stored block chain. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Luke-Jr    2013-03-17 15:39:37 UTC  ``` CVE-2013-2292 should get another bug, as it is still unresolved. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2013-03-19 20:26:55 UTC  ``` CVE-2013-2293 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-2293>):   The CTransaction::FetchInputs method in bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before   0.8.0rc1 copies transactions from disk to memory without incrementally   checking for spent prevouts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial   of service (disk I/O consumption) via a Bitcoin transaction with many inputs   corresponding to many different parts of the stored block chain.  CVE-2013-2292 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-2292>):   bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a   denial of service (electricity consumption) by mining a block to create a   nonstandard Bitcoin transaction containing multiple OP_CHECKSIG script   opcodes.  CVE-2013-2273 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-2273>):   bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.4.9rc1, 0.5.x before 0.5.8rc1, 0.6.0 before   0.6.0.11rc1, 0.6.1 through 0.6.5 before 0.6.5rc1, and 0.7.x before 0.7.3rc1   make it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive   information about returned change by leveraging certain predictability in   the outputs of a Bitcoin transaction.  CVE-2013-2272 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-2272>):   The penny-flooding protection mechanism in the CTxMemPool::accept method in   bitcoind and Bitcoin-Qt before 0.4.9rc1, 0.5.x before 0.5.8rc1, 0.6.0 before   0.6.0.11rc1, 0.6.1 through 0.6.5 before 0.6.5rc1, and 0.7.x before 0.7.3rc1   allows remote attackers to determine associations between wallet addresses   and IP addresses via a series of large Bitcoin transactions with   insufficient fees. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2013-03-19 21:46:19 UTC  ``` Luke can you identify which ones we should keep on the tree and which ones we should drop? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2013-03-27 23:57:59 UTC  ``` net-p2p/bitcoind, net-p2p/bitcoin-qt 0.8.1 are now in the tree. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Luke-Jr    2013-03-28 00:44:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=462046#c4)) > net-p2p/bitcoind, net-p2p/bitcoin-qt 0.8.1 are now in the tree.  Note that 0.8.1 did not fix any of the vulnerabilities in this bug... ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2013-03-28 00:46:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=462046#c5)) > (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=462046#c4)) > > net-p2p/bitcoind, net-p2p/bitcoin-qt 0.8.1 are now in the tree. >  > Note that 0.8.1 did not fix any of the vulnerabilities in this bug...  Thanks wasn't certain, hence [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=462046#c3) ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-08-30 00:52:03 UTC  ``` @maintainers: ping, does 0.8.3 fix these issues? ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Luke-Jr    2013-08-30 01:17:19 UTC  ``` <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CVEs> ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Luke-Jr    2015-02-23 23:04:05 UTC  ``` This should be closed. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2015-02-23 23:09:20 UTC  ``` @security team.  go ahead and vote on glsa. we're done. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-03-18 07:37:59 UTC  ``` Vulnerable packages have been gone for over 2 years so no GLSA. ``` |  |
