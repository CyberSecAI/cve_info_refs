  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2013-3219",
    "description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "affectedVersions": [
      "Bitcoin-Qtbitcoind 0.8.0rc1 - 0.8.0"
    ],
    "fixedVersions": [
      "Bitcoin-Qtbitcoind 0.8.1"
    ],
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is related to an unenforced block protocol rule in Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind versions 0.8.0rc1 and 0.8.0. This means that a specific check within the block validation process is missing or not properly enforced, leading to potential issues.",
    "vulnerabilityDetails": "The specific nature of the unenforced block protocol rule is not fully detailed in the provided content. However, its absence allows for the creation of blocks that would normally be deemed invalid under stricter enforcement of the rule. The impact of the vulnerability was that nodes could accept invalid blocks, potentially causing a chain split.",
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability was a potential chain split as described in the action items of BIP-0050 where some nodes would accept the invalid blocks while others would reject them. This could be exploited by miners to potentially cause network disruptions. Furthermore, it allowed for double spends as some nodes would accept transactions using the invalid blocks.",
    "attackVectors": "The attack vector involves a miner creating a block that violates the unenforced block protocol rule. This block is then propagated through the network. Vulnerable nodes will accept this block, leading to a potential chain split.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to mine a block. The attacker would create a block that violates the rule, and if successful would potentially double spend via chain split.  This attack is specific to the Bitcoin network and requires knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol and the specific vulnerability."
