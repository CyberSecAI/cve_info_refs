Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Word improperly handling objects in memory when parsing specially crafted Office files. This can lead to memory corruption, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Word parses specially crafted files.
- Improper handling of objects in memory during file parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, granting the attacker the same user rights as the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
- An attacker could install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new user accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. A user needs to open a specially crafted file attached to an email message.
- In a web-based attack, an attacker could host a website containing a malicious Office file. Users would need to be tricked into visiting the site and opening the file.
- Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could host malicious content that exploits this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office file to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to deliver the crafted file to a potential victim, either via email or by hosting it on a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file using an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Word 2003 SP3, but not Word 2010, Word 2013, or Word Viewer.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-086.
- Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and no public exploit was known when the security bulletin was originally issued.
- Mitigating factors include the need for user interaction to open the malicious file and the reduced impact on users with fewer system privileges.
- Workarounds include using MOICE, File Block policy, and caution when opening attachments.
