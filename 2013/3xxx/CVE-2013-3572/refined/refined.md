- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The UniFi software fails to properly escape the hostname of wireless clients when displaying it in the administration interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the UniFi Controller interface, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or arbitrary HTML injection when a wireless client's information is rendered in the UI.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker forges a special hostname for a wireless client that contains malicious HTML and/or JavaScript code. When the UniFi Controller displays the hostname, the injected code is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the hostname of a wireless client that is connected to a UniFi network managed by the vulnerable UniFi Controller.
