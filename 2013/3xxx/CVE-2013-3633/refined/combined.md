SUMMARY

Two vulnerabilities have been reported for the Siemens SCALANCE X-200 and X-200IRT switch families
concerning a privilege escalation bug in the web interface and an authentication problem in the SNMPv3
implementation. Siemens has addressed both vulnerabilities by ﬁrmware upgrades.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable SNMPv3 completely to mitigate CVE-2013-3634

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2013-3633

The user privileges for the web interface are only enforced on client side and not properly veriﬁed on
server side. Therefore, an attacker is able to execute privileged commands using an unprivileged
account.

CWE-603: Use of Client-Side Authentication

Vulnerability CVE-2013-3634

The implementation of SNMPv3 does not check the user credentials sufﬁciently. Therefore, an attacker
is able to execute SNMP commands without correct credentials.
