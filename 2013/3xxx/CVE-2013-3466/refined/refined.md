Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-3466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of user identities during EAP-FAST authentication within the Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation of user identities during EAP-FAST authentication.
- Command injection vulnerability which allows arbitrary command execution on the underlying Windows OS

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Cisco Secure ACS server.
- This allows the attacker to gain full control of the affected server.
- Commands are executed in the context of the System user, meaning elevated privileges on the server are achieved.
- Complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted EAP-FAST packets to an affected Cisco Secure ACS server.
- The vulnerability is exposed over the network via standard RADIUS UDP ports 1812 or 1645, which are used for EAP-FAST authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco Secure ACS server.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious EAP-FAST packets.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only affects Cisco Secure ACS when configured as a RADIUS server with EAP-FAST authentication enabled.
- Cisco Secure ACS configured as a TACACS+ server only is not vulnerable as it does not support EAP-FAST authentication.
- The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS base score of 10.0 and a temporal score of 8.3.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Secure ACS for Windows release 4.2.1.15.11.
