  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient authentication mechanisms and reliance on easily manipulated Referer-header checks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient authentication in multiple components.",
        "Referer-header checks as the primary security measure.",
        "Unauthenticated file disclosure and write/modification.",
        "Multiple permanent XSS vulnerabilities.",
        "Direct OS command injection.",
        "XML external entity injection (XXE).",
        "Access to sensitive files with low privileges."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to modify the administrator web interface, read sensitive configuration files, or execute arbitrary operating system commands with the permissions of the GroundWork Monitor Enterprise system.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating Referer-headers to bypass authentication.",
        "Exploiting webapp admin interface vulnerabilities.",
        "Exploiting MONARCH component vulnerabilities.",
         "Accessing sensitive files through specific URLs.",
         "Writing files using the performance component to execute OS commands."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system. For some vulnerabilities like OS command injection in the MONARCH component, a valid JOSSO SSO cookie with at least low-privileged access is needed. Otherwise, many vulnerabilities are exploitable without prior authentication."
