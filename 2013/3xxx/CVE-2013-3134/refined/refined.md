Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Microsoft .NET Framework's Common Language Runtime (CLR) allocates arrays of small structures. There's an error in how the CLR handles memory allocation when dealing with these specific types of arrays.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Array Allocation: The CLR incorrectly allocates memory for arrays of small structures. This likely leads to an out-of-bounds write or read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This allows the attacker to gain control of the system.
- Privilege Escalation: If the user running the vulnerable application has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control, enabling them to install software, modify data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- .NET Application Attack: An attacker can manipulate the data within a .NET application in a way that triggers the flawed memory allocation, leading to remote code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to Run .NET Application: The attacker needs to be able to execute a crafted .NET application.
- User Interaction (indirect): No direct user interaction is needed. The attacker would need to get a victim to run a specially crafted application.

**Additional Details:**

- Affected Systems: x64-based workstations and servers are primarily at risk. 32-bit systems are not affected by this specific vulnerability.
- Public Disclosure: This vulnerability had been publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin.
- No Known Exploitation: At the time of the bulletin's release, there were no reports of this vulnerability being actively exploited.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities addressed in MS13-052**

The security bulletin MS13-052 addresses a multitude of vulnerabilities including:
- TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability (CVE-2013-3129): Allows for remote code execution when handling TTF files.
- Array Access Violation Vulnerability (CVE-2013-3131): Allows remote code execution due to improper handling of multi-dimensional arrays in .NET Framework.
- Delegate Reflection Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2013-3132): Allows for privilege escalation by bypassing security checks in .NET Framework reflection.
- Anonymous Method Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2013-3133): Allows for privilege escalation by improperly validating permissions on reflection.
- Array Allocation Vulnerability (CVE-2013-3134): Allows remote code execution due to incorrect allocation of small arrays in .NET CLR.
- Delegate Serialization Vulnerability (CVE-2013-3171): Allows privilege escalation through improper validation on delegate objects during serialization.
- Null Pointer Vulnerability (CVE-2013-3178): Allows for remote code execution through a null pointer dereference in Silverlight.
