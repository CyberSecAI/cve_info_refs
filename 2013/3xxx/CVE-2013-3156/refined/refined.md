Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Access parses and validates data when opening specially crafted Access files. Specifically, it involves memory corruption during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption due to improper parsing of Access file content. This can lead to control-flow hijacking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the current user.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, enabling them to install programs, view, modify, or delete data, and create new accounts.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not the main vector of attack in this case, if the user has some kind of lower-level access, this could potentially escalate to full system access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Attack:** An attacker could send a specially crafted Access file via email and convince the user to open it.
*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a website containing a malicious Access file and convince the user to visit the website and open the file. Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content could also be used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Access file that exploits the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file using social engineering techniques, either through email or a website.
*   The attacker can be in a remote location to perform this exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft Access 2007 SP3, Access 2010 SP1 & SP2 (32 & 64 bit), and Access 2013 (32 & 64 bit).
*   Microsoft rates this as an "Important" vulnerability with a remote code execution risk.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security update was released.
*   There were no reports of exploitation in the wild at the time of the advisory.
*   The update corrects how Microsoft Access validates data when opening the specially crafted files.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Kaveh Ghaemmaghami of Secunia SVCRP
