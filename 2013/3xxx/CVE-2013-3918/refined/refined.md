  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the InformationCardSigninHelper Class ActiveX control, icardie.dll. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted webpage. When a user views the webpage, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user.",

  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to how the `InformationCardSigninHelper Class ActiveX control` is instantiated in Internet Explorer, which can corrupt the system state and allow for arbitrary code execution.",

      "Insecure instantiation of the control leading to memory corruption."

    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system.",
        "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted webpage that instantiates the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
            "Compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content/advertisements."
