Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3847:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Word's improper handling of objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerabilities exist in Microsoft Word, where parsing of specially crafted files can corrupt system memory, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user.
- Complete Control: If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system.
- Actions: Attackers could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new user accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially crafted files: The vulnerabilities are triggered when a user opens a specially crafted document using affected versions of Microsoft Word.
- Email Attack Scenario: An attacker sends the specially crafted file to a user.
- Web-based Attack Scenario: An attacker hosts a website with a specially crafted file, or a compromised website contains the malicious content, and convinces users to download and open it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office file.
- The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious document. This can be achieved through email or by hosting it on a malicious website.
- No special privileges are required beyond a user being able to open a document, the permissions gained after exploitation are based on the current user's rights.
