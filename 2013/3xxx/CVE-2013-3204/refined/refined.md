Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3204:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
- This can lead to the attacker being able to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- Attackers can also leverage compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content or ads.
- Attackers must convince the user to visit the malicious site, typically by getting them to click on a link in an email or instant message or by getting them to open a malicious attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious website or compromise an existing one.
- They need to convince a user to view the crafted website via a link or attachment.
- No specific privilege is required for the initial exploit but successful exploitation allows for privilege escalation to that of the current user.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-069.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer including 7, 8, 9 and 10.
- The severity rating of this vulnerability is "Critical" for client operating systems and "Moderate" for server operating systems.
- It was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the security bulletin release.
- Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers mitigates the risk, although doesn't fully prevent exploitation if a user adds malicious sites to the trusted sites list
- EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) can help mitigate attacks.
- There are workarounds such as disabling Active Scripting and ActiveX controls, but these can break website functionality.
