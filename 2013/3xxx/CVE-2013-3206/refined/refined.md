Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is a memory corruption issue, which occurs when Internet Explorer handles objects in memory incorrectly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker then needs to convince a user to visit the site.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers may compromise legitimate websites or use sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements to host the exploit.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers would typically use social engineering tactics like email or instant messaging to trick users into clicking malicious links or opening malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to host a website or compromise a website:** The attacker needs the capability to host a website containing the exploit, or be able to inject the exploit into a compromised site.
- **Social Engineering skills:** The attacker must be able to convince a user to visit the malicious site, typically through social engineering tactics such as phishing.
