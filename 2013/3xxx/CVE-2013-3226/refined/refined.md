{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's Bluetooth SCO sockets implementation did not correctly update the `msg_namelen` field in the `sco_sock_recvmsg()` function under certain conditions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could exploit this vulnerability to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local user can call `recvmsg` or `recvfrom` on a Bluetooth SCO socket.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when the socket is in state `BT_CONNECT2` and `BT_SK_DEFER_SETUP` is set in the flags. In this scenario, `sco_sock_recvmsg()` returns early with 0 without updating the `msg_namelen` member, leading to a kernel stack information leak.",
