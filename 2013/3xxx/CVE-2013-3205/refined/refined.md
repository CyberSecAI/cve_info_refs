Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer where it improperly accesses an object in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability.
- Improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege escalation: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system. This includes actions such as installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Social Engineering: The attacker convinces a user to visit the malicious website, typically through phishing emails or instant messages.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content/advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious website, typically via social engineering.
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker gains the same user rights as the user visiting the malicious site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer: 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 on various Windows client and server platforms.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as Critical for client versions of Windows and Moderate for server versions.
- The vulnerability was privately reported and addressed by Microsoft in the MS13-069 security bulletin.
- This CVE is one of ten memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed in the same security update, indicating a pattern of similar vulnerabilities within the product.

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Users with fewer rights are less impacted than users with administrative rights.
- Default settings of Outlook/Outlook Express/Windows Mail opening HTML in restricted zones can reduce risk
- Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Servers helps mitigate the vulnerabilities
- EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) helps mitigate the vulnerabilities in systems where its installed

**Workarounds:**
- Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting
- Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable Active Scripting
