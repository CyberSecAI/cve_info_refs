Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3862:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a double-free condition within the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM). This occurs when the SCM retrieves a corrupted service description from the Windows registry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double Free Vulnerability: The SCM attempts to free allocated memory more than once, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SCM process (services.exe), potentially granting them complete control over the affected system.
- **Code Execution:** An attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Execution:** An attacker with valid logon credentials can log on locally and execute a specially crafted application.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker could convince an authenticated user to run a malicious application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials or be able to convince a user to execute a malicious application.
- They need to be able to execute a specially crafted application that triggers the double-free vulnerability.
- Local access to the system or the ability to persuade a local user to run the application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how the SCM handles objects in memory when presented with corrupted service descriptions.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security update was released.
- There were no reports of exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the bulletin's release.
