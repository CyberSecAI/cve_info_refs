- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the availability of the default Tomcat administration interface in IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager (TADDM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The presence of default Tomcat files (manager.xml and host-manager.xml) allows access to the Tomcat administration interface. The administrative interfaces are accessible without requiring credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can gain access to the Tomcat administration interface.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing the following URLs on the TADDM server:
    - `http://<taddm_ip>:9430/manager/html`
    - `http://<taddm_ip>:9430/host-manager/html`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the TADDM server to access the vulnerable URLs.
