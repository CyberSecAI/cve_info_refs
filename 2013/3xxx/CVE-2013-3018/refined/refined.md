- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The default deployment of the AXIS web application in IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager (TADDM) allows unauthorized access to TADDM configuration information. This is due to the AXIS web application being enabled by default, exposing sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue. The AXIS web application, when enabled, exposes configuration information without requiring authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain access to TADDM configuration information, potentially leading to further compromise of the system or network.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through network access to the TADDM server using HTTP requests to specific AXIS URLs (e.g., /axis/happyaxis.jsp, /axis/fingerprint.jsp, /axis/index.html).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the TADDM server on the port where the AXIS web application is running (default port 9430). No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
