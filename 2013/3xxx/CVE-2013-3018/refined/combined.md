# Security Bulletin: TADDM â€“ Security improvement: AXIS in TADDM reveal configuration information without authentication.

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Default deployment of AXIS webapp may allow access to TADDM configuration information. TADDM security improvement deployed starting from TADDM 7.2.1.5 and in TADDM 7.2.2 prevents improper access.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-2013-3018**

## Affected Products and Versions

TADDM 7.1.2 and 7.2.0.0 through 7.2.1.4 (later TADDM releases contain parameter that allow to disable AXIS)

## Remediation/Fixes

Upgrade to TADDM version 7.2.1.5 or 7.2.2.0.

Starting with TADDM version 7.2.1.5 and 7.2.2.0 we have added a $COLLATION\_HOME/dist/collation.properties value to disable Axis:

com.ibm.taddm.axis.enabled=false (default is true)

This parameter change requires a restart of TADDM server.

If you are unable to upgrade, apply workaround, or please contact IBM Support.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

1. Stop TADDM server:

2. Delete folders:

rm -fr $COLLATION\_HOME/deploy-tomcat/axis\*

rm -fr $COLLATION\_HOME/external/apache-tomcat-x.x.xx/work/Catalina/localhost

in Windows OS the path is %COLLATION\_HOME%\deploy-tomcat\axis\* and %COLLATION\_HOME%\external\apache-tomcat-x.x.xx\work\Catalina\localhost

3. Start TADDM server, this page should not be available:
