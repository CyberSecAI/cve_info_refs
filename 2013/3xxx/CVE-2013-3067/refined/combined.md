# Taking over the Linksys WRT310Nv2

[[return to summary]](../../../casestudies/exploiting-soho-routers/#summary)

* The WRT310Nv2 can be taken over by a remote adversary through CSRF attack.

## Description

The Linksys WRT310Nv2 router is susceptible to several CSRF attacks, which allow an attacker to forge HTML forms and execute actions on behalf of a legitimate user. ISE created a proof of concept demonstration that, when executed by an administrator with an active management session, changes the administrator credentials and enables remote management.

## Attack Requirements

* The victim must have an active management session with the WRT310Nv2 router.
* The victim must be fooled in to performing an action (e.g., by clicking an attacker provided link), browse to a malicious or compromised site, or be the victim of a man-in-the-middle attack.

## Details

All HTML forms present in the WRT310Nv2 are susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery.

* Vulnerable Firmware is v2.0.0.1.
* Other versions of the firmware were not tested.

## Impact

A successful attack exploiting this vulnerability can give a remote adversary full control of the victim router.

## Recommendations to the vendor

* Cross-Site request forgery can be prevented by including an unpredictable token in each HTTP request submitted to the web server. At a minimum, these tokens should be unique to each user, but it is recommended that each HTML form delivered contain a unique token.
* In addition to HTML form tokens, HTTP referer checking should be enabled.
* Additional information for vendors regarding immediate and long term fixes for these issues can be found on our summary page [here](../../../casestudies/exploiting-soho-routers/#recommendationsVendors).

## Recommendations to device administrators

* (4/13/2013) There is not currently an available firmware upgrade that will remedy this vulnerability.
* Take additional preventative measures and precautions by following the steps outlined on our summary page [here](../../../casestudies/exploiting-soho-routers/#recommendationsAdmin).

## Proof of Concept

In the following proof of concept attack, we assume that an WRT310Nv2 device administrator with an active management session established with the router has browsed to a malicious web page. Once there, an automatic form submission takes place to the Administrator's router, from the Administrator's browser. Since the Administrator has a current session established with the router, the form submissions are processed.

Here, the administrator password is changed to ISE\_1337, and remote management is enabled on port 1337.

Figure 1. Attack page 1.

At this point, the attacker can remotely administer, and thereby remotely control the WRT310Nv2.
