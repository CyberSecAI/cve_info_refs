The provided content discusses a CSRF vulnerability in Linksys WRT310Nv2 router, and mentions CVE-2013-3067 as a related cross-site scripting vulnerability, but does not describe it in detail.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of CSRF protection in the Linksys WRT310Nv2 router's web interface. The router's HTML forms do not use any unpredictable tokens to prevent CSRF attacks, and HTTP referer checking is not enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the vulnerability to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). All HTML forms are susceptible to CSRF.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful CSRF attack allows an attacker to gain full control of the victim's router. This includes changing the administrator password and enabling remote management, allowing for complete remote control of the router.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in administrator into performing an action, typically by:
- Clicking a link provided by the attacker
- Browsing to a malicious or compromised website
- Being a victim of a Man-in-the-Middle attack

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires the following:
- The victim must have an active management session with the WRT310Nv2 router.
- The attacker needs a way to trick the user to perform an action that will send a crafted request to the router.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the router for the CSRF attack.
