Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is reflected back to the user in multiple POST parameters across several scripts. This lack of sanitization allows the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code that is then executed within a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the context of the affected site, within the user's browser session. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, phishing, and defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted POST requests to specific URLs.
- The vulnerable parameters are:
  - `_loginUserName` in `/application/login/login.html`
  - `my_account_login` in `/c/portal_public/login`
  - `email` in `/dotCMS/forgotPassword`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests to the affected URLs with malicious code in the vulnerable parameters.
- The attacker does not need administrative access to exploit this vulnerability.
- No specific user interaction is mentioned. The malicious script will execute if a user visits the crafted links/submits malicious forms.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Ivan Markovic / Secunia.
- The vulnerability was fixed in dotCMS version 2.3.2 by using the ESAPI library to properly escape HTML.
- Mitigation strategies include upgrading to dotCMS 2.3.2 or later, restricting admin access to trusted IPs, or creating a hotfix based on the provided GitHub commits.
