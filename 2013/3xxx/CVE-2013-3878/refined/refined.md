    "Vulnerability_Details": {

        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
       "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges on the local system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full administrator rights.",
      "Attack_Vectors": "An attacker with valid logon credentials and local access can exploit this vulnerability by running a malicious LRPC server that sends a specially crafted LPC port message to the LRPC client.",
