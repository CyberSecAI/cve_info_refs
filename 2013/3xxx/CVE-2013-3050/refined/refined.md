Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3050:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the ZAPms content management system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `pid` parameter in the `products` page, before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, such as user credentials, configuration details, and other confidential information.
*   **Database Modification:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data loss, corruption, or unauthorized changes.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database user permissions, a successful exploit might give the attacker control over the database server and potentially, the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/products` endpoint.
*   **`pid` Parameter:** The `pid` parameter in the URL is the vulnerable input vector, specifically at the `http://[server]/products?pid=[SQLi]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with the malicious SQL injection payload embedded in the `pid` parameter.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit can be executed without prior authentication, meaning any user accessing the vulnerable page can potentially exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided PoC demonstrates how to retrieve database version, name, and user information.
* The vulnerability affects ZAPms version 1.41 and likely earlier versions.
