    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper validation of permissions for delegate objects during serialization."

    "Attack vectors": [
      "Web browsing attack: By hosting a specially crafted website that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application).",
       "Windows .NET applications attack: This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET Framework applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to convince a user to visit a specially crafted website or run a malicious .NET application."
