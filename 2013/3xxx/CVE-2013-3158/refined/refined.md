Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of objects in memory by Microsoft Excel and other affected Microsoft Office software while parsing specially crafted Office files. This memory corruption issue can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability when parsing specially crafted Office files
- Improper validation of data while parsing specially crafted Office files

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE)
- Complete control of the affected system
- Ability to install programs
- Ability to view, change, or delete data
- Ability to create new accounts with full user rights
- Impact is greater for users with administrative rights than those with fewer user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted Office file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel or other affected Microsoft Office software.
- **Email Attack Scenario:** Sending a malicious Office file to a user and convincing them to open it.
- **Web-Based Attack Scenario:** Hosting a website that contains a malicious Office file and convincing users to visit the website and open the file. This could include compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content or advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft malicious Office files that exploit the memory corruption vulnerability.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file to the victim, either through email or by hosting it on a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the specially crafted file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email, the user needs to open the attachment.
- The provided text mentions that the update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Excel and other affected Microsoft software validates data when parsing specially crafted Office files.
-  The Microsoft Exploitability Index for this vulnerability is 1, indicating that exploitation is more likely. This is because analysis has shown that exploit code could be created and there are past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
- Microsoft had not received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited in the wild at the time of the bulletin's release.
- The document notes that a workaround is available by blocking the opening of Excel binary files (\*.xls, \*.xla, \*.xlt, \*.xlm, \*.xlw, and \*.xlb) using the Microsoft Office File Block policy.
