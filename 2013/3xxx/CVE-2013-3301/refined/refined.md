    "information": {
      "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's ftrace subsystem when writing to `set_ftrace_pid` or `set_graph_function` files. This occurs due to `seq_open()` being called only for FMODE_READ, leading to a NULL `seq_file` when the file is opened for writing and a subsequent seek operation is performed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Incorrect file operation handling",
        "Missing validation of file operations"
      ],
      "impact": "A local, privileged (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) user can trigger a kernel crash (denial of service) by exploiting the NULL pointer dereference vulnerability.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Writing to `set_ftrace_pid` or `set_graph_function` debug files with a write file descriptor, causing a seek operation."
