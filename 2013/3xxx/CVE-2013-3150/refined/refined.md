Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3150:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer when it improperly accesses an object in memory. This improper access can corrupt memory in a way that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is web-based. An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer.
- Attackers can also compromise legitimate websites or use websites that accept user-provided content or ads to host malicious content.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious website. This can be achieved through social engineering tactics, such as tricking the user into clicking on a link in an email or instant message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a legitimate website.
- They must also be able to convince a user to visit this malicious site through some form of social engineering.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the victim's system before the exploit is launched, as successful exploitation grants the attacker the same user rights as the current user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin, nor were there reports of active exploitation of this specific CVE.
- Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability if it is installed and configured properly.
