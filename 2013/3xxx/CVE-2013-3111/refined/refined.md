  "CVE-2013-3111": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 related to how the browser handles IEFRAME elements, specifically within the `CSelectionInteractButtonBehavior::_UpdateButtonLocation` function. This can be triggered by a specially crafted webpage.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free error within the `CSelectionInteractButtonBehavior::_UpdateButtonLocation` function in Internet Explorer 9 when handling IEFRAME elements.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
     "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user running Internet Explorer. This would grant the attacker the same privileges as the user, potentially allowing them to install programs, view, modify, or delete data, or create new accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted web page that exploits the use-after-free vulnerability when loaded in Internet Explorer 9."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page in Internet Explorer 9.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered through specific JavaScript commands (`document.execCommand('SelectAll')` and `document.execCommand('superscript')`) and manipulating elements within the DOM, specifically swapping a `sup` element with the document's root element using setTimeout. Disabling Javascript will prevent the vulnerability from being triggered."
