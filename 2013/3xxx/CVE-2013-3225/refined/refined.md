{
  "CVE-2013-3225": {
    "description": "The rfcomm_sock_recvmsg function in net/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain length variable, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `rfcomm_sock_recvmsg` function in the Linux kernel's Bluetooth RFCOMM protocol implementation does not properly initialize the `msg_namelen` variable under certain conditions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Leak",
        "Missing Initialization"
      ],
      "impact": "An unprivileged local user can leak kernel stack memory by crafting a specific `recvmsg` or `recvfrom` system call.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access",
        "Crafted `recvmsg` or `recvfrom` system call"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must have local access to the system and the ability to make crafted system calls."
    },
    "affected_components": [
      "Linux kernel with Bluetooth RFCOMM protocol support"
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered when `RFCOMM_DEFER_SETUP` flag is set, causing the function to return early without updating `msg_namelen`, leading to the kernel stack leak. The leaked information is 128 bytes of kernel stack memory.",
    "patches": [

            "commit_url": "http://git.kernel.org/linus/e11e0455c0d7d3d62276a0c55d9dfbc16779d691",
