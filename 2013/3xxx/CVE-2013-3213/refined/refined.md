Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2013-3213:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in the insufficient sanitization and validation of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries within the Vtiger CRM application. Specifically, the following methods are affected:

*   `get_picklists()` in `/soap/customerportal.php`
*   `get_tickets_list()` in `/soap/customerportal.php`
*   `SearchContactsByEmail()` in `/soap/thunderbirdplugin.php`
*   `SearchContactsByEmail()` in `/soap/vtigerolservice.php`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, arising from the direct embedding of user-supplied data into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
    *   In `get_picklists()`, the `picklist_name` parameter is escaped, but then used without quotes in a query, making it vulnerable.
    *  In `get_tickets_list()`, the `where` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query.
    *   In `SearchContactsByEmail()` methods, the `emailaddress` parameter is passed to the `Contacts::get_searchbyemailid()` method, which is also vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the CRM system.
*   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, an attacker might be able to leverage SQL injection to compromise the underlying system by potentially executing OS commands via database stored procedures or functions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SOAP API:** The vulnerabilities are primarily exposed through the SOAP API endpoints of the Vtiger CRM. This means an attacker can send specially crafted SOAP requests to trigger the vulnerabilities.
    *   `get_picklists()` and `get_tickets_list()` are located in `/soap/customerportal.php`
    *   `SearchContactsByEmail()` is present in `/soap/thunderbirdplugin.php` and `/soap/vtigerolservice.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Vtiger CRM instance to send SOAP requests.
*   **Authentication:**
    *   For `get_picklists()` and `get_tickets_list()`, a valid session is required to bypass the `validateSession` method check.
    *   For `SearchContactsByEmail()` in `/soap/thunderbirdplugin.php`, valid credentials are required.
    *   For `SearchContactsByEmail()` in `/soap/vtigerolservice.php`, a valid username is required, in addition to a valid session.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters, such as `picklist_name`, `where` and `emailaddress` and how to craft malicious payloads for them.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, offering specific vulnerable code snippets and attack vectors.
*   The vendor released a patch to address these vulnerabilities, as detailed in the provided links.

In summary, CVE-2013-3213 describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Vtiger CRM versions 5.0.0 to 5.4.0, stemming from inadequate input validation in SOAP API methods. Exploitation could lead to data breaches, manipulation, and potentially system compromise. Successful attacks require network access, in some cases valid credentials and knowledge of vulnerable parameters.
