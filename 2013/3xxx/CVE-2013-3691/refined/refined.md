Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3691:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) caused by overbuffering the path '/'.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The web server on the Airlive camera devices is unable to handle a request with a large number of 'a' characters in the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability results in a denial of service, taking down the HTTP service on the camera. The device becomes inaccessible via HTTP.
- The service will be down for approximately 2 minutes, but repeated attacks can prevent the service from recovering.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed by sending an HTTP GET request to the camera with a large number of "a" characters in the path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target camera. This means they need network connectivity to the camera's IP address. No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**
- A sample attack request is provided: `http://xx.xx.xx.xx/[a*3000]`
-  The device responds with a "Connection has been reset" message, and subsequently, becomes unreachable with a "Can't Connect" error.
- A Python script is provided to demonstrate the attack, which involves sending a large crafted GET request to the camera.
```python
    @    request = 'GET /' + ‘A’ * 3000 + '.html HTTP/1.0\r\n'
    @    s = socket.socket()
    @    s.connect((cam_ip, 80))
    @    s.send(request)
    @    response = s.recv(1024)
    @    s.close()
```
