Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3667:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the software's built-in update mechanism using HTTP to connect to the update server for fetching update information. This insecure connection method allows for potential tampering or corruption of the downloaded update.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of insecure HTTP protocol for update downloads
- Lack of verification of the downloaded update before installation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks could allow an attacker to intercept the update request and serve a malicious update instead of the legitimate one.
- This could lead to the installation of malware on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack on the network connection between the user and the update server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the user's machine and the update server. This could be on the same local network or by controlling a network device in the path of the connection.
- The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious update disguised as a legitimate one.

**Mitigation:**
The fix for this vulnerability involves changing the update mechanism to use HTTPS for fetching update information and verifying the downloaded update before installation.
