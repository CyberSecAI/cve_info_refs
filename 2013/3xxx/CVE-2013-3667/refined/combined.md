## Yojimbo 4.0 Release Notes

This page documents all feature additions and modifications included in the Yojimbo 4.0 release.

For information on changes made in previous versions of Yojimbo, please see the [release notes archive](archived_notes.html).

You can access Yojimbo's online help by choosing "Yojimbo Help" from the Help menu.

### Additions

* Yojimbo's internals have been rewritten to use a new sync
  mechanism, in the wake of MobileMe's shutdown. It is *not* based
  on iCloud; see
  [here](http://rms2.tumblr.com/post/46505165521/the-gathering-storm-our-travails-with-icloud-sync) for details on why.

  For complete details on how to set up and use synchronization,
  choose "Syncing" from the Help menu.
* Full screen support has been added for the main Yojimbo window and
  for discrete item windows. Some other windows have been designated
  as "auxiliary" windows, so that when in full screen mode, they can
  be opened without causing a Spaces switch.

### Changes and Fixes

* Yojimbo now requires Mac OS X 10.8.2 or later (OS X 10.8.5 or later
  recommended). It *will not run* on an older version of the OS. (Note
  that this also means that you need an Intel Mac, since 10.8.x does
  not run on PPC Macs nor does it include Rosetta.)
* In support of the sync system change, there has been a database
  format change. Your existing Yojimbo data will be converted, and
  this process is irreversible. (Yojimbo will make a backup of your
  current stored data before converting to the new format.)

  Once you upgrade to 4.0, you *cannot* go back to a previous
  version of Yojimbo without restoring your old data from a
  backup. Note also that if you do have to go back to your backed
  up data, you will lose any additions or changes you have made
  since backing up. This cannot be avoided.
* When starting the application from somewhere other than
  `/Applications/` (or `~/Applications/`), you're now offered the
  opportunity to relocate it to `/Applications`. This provides a
  better first-run experience.
* Fixed crash which was reported when the Microsoft Exchange
  plug-in poked data into the Address Book's database and somehow
  we got notified.
* Fixed internal exception and crash which would occur when using
  the "Add Hyperlink" command to add a link at the insertion point
  of a note (rather than annotating selected text).
* The built-in software update mechanism now uses `https` to
  connect to the update server for fetching update information, and
  verifies the downloaded update before installation to guard
  against tampering or corruption. This fixes `CVE-2013-3667`;
  thanks to Chris Hickstein for the report.
* Fixed bug in which the scrollbar calibration in the Tag Explorer
  didn't work correctly, nor did the scrollbar auto-hide when it
  should have.
* Corrected the VoiceOver descriptions for the Add Collection
  button and the Actions button in the collection list.
* Fixed a bug which which interfered when trying to reconcile
  multiple encryption passwords.

TextWrangler 4.5.3 Release Notes

TextWrangler 4.5.3 is a focused maintenance update which includes fixes for reported issues.

For details on all the new features and enhancements that were offered in TextWrangler 4.5, please see its [release notes](notes_tw45.html).

For information on changes made in previous versions, please see the [release notes archive](archived_notes.html).

For detailed information on using any of TextWrangler's features, please refer to the user manual (choose "User Manual" from TextWrangler's Help menu).

### Requirements

TextWrangler 4.5 requires Mac OS X 10.6.8 or later.

*PowerPC-based Macs are not supported.*

### Additions

* This release consists entirely of fixes for reported issues, and
  contains no new features.

### Changes

* When starting the application from somewhere other than
  `/Applications/` (or `~/Applications/`), you're now offered
  the opportunity to relocate it to `/Applications`. This
  replaces the old alert about running from the install image,
  and provides a better first-run experience as well. (This all
  only applies to non-App Store builds.)
* When starting the application, holding down the Command,
  Control, and Shift keys will now give you the opportunity to
  discard any existing auto-save state. You should do so with
  extreme caution; discarding the auto-save state means that
  you will *lose* any unsaved changes or untitled documents
  that were previously remembered as part of the crash recovery
  mechanics.
* Made some cosmetic adjustments to the Line Numbers bar in
  editing views.
* Made some cosmetic adjustments to the Cursor Position
  display in editing view status bars.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug in which horizontal scrollbar calibration would
  be incorrect in certain edge cases; it should now generally
  be more accurate than before.
* Fixed bug in which clicking the "View Privacy Policy" button in
  the TextWrangler first-run/register dialog would report an error
  instead of going to the privacy page.
* Fixed bug in which the `x-counterpart` variable in files would
  cause a failure to find the counterpart when they were of
  differing languages or names. Also added `Resources` as a search
  directory for counterparts.
* Rewrote our custom cursors to use image-based `NSCursor` instead
  of `CURS` resources, for great justice (and correct appearance on
  retina displays).
* Since the contents of `*/Library/QuickTime/` seem to exist only
  to crash applications, those plug-ins are now prevented from
  loading into our address space.
* Application state snapshots now include the count of untitled
  windows, to avoid confusion when creating new untitled documents
  after starting up with saved state.
* Made a change to prevent addition of a default filename
  extension when doing a Save As or other operation which involved
  generating a default file name, and the document name already had
  an extension.
* Fixed bug in which closing the last document in an editing
  window would not close the window in situations where multiple
  documents had been selected in the window's sidebar.
* Fixed crash which would occur when closing a document listed in
  the sidebar, after the sidebar item had been dragged into a
  different order in the list. (At that point the item would fail
  to update its name if the file's name on disk changed, as well.)
* Made changes so that the FTP/SFTP bookmark internals will return
  and report errors when given bad input, rather than crashing.
  (Still no clarity on why the bad input was happening, though.)
* Fixed bug which would cause internal exceptions (and subsequent
  strange behavior, like all menus being disabled) at startup on
  certain systems. I don't know why she swallowed a fly.
* Fixed a bug in the `twfind` tool in which it would fail to
  report results back to standard output.
* The built-in software update mechanism now uses `https` to
  connect to the update server for fetching update information, and
  verifies the downloaded update before installation to guard
  against tampering or corruption. This fixes `CVE-2013-3667`,
  thanks to Chris Hickstein for the report.
* Made a change to the window geometry calculations so that
  default diff results tiling is on the main screen again in
  systems containing two (or more) screens of identical shape and
  size.
* Fixed crash which would occur when opening a document with saved
  state indicating a split view, but for which the split ended up
  not being restored (possibly due to display geometry changes).
* When choosing a font size that is too large (as defined by its
  line height exceeding the height of the text view it's asked to
  display in), an editing view will refuse the change. This will
  address the occasional situation in which the edit fields in the
  Find or Multi-File Search windows appear to be blank or behave
  strangely when the default editing font is set to a sufficiently
  large size.
* Fixed bug in which Move Line Up/Down didn't properly scroll the
  moved text back into view in situations where it should have.
* Crash my app at startup and you're banned from the ballpark.
  Yeah, EasySIMBL, I'm talking to you.
* The various HTML DTD tables are now included in TextWrangler, to
  improve accuracy in code folding computation.
* Fixed crash which would occur sometimes when closing documents
  while the Multi-File Search window was open.
* Flash Player, you have generated your last crash log.
* Added a build phase to strip xattrs from items in the
  application package, which solves a problem in which the OS
  creates Finder attribute files when the application is copied to
  a non-HFS file system (e.g. a `FAT`-formatted USB thumb drive)
  and in so doing renders the application's code signature invalid.
* Fixed crash which would occur rarely when trying to open a
  document.
* Fixed crash which would occur sometimes when using "Hard
  Wrap Text" to wrap a paragraph at the beginning of the
  document.

* Removed vestigial "Update Siteâ¦" command from the `Markup =>
  Update` menu, which did nothing but report an error.
* When choosing a font size that is too large (as defined by its
  line height exceeding the height of the text view it's asked to

  Yeah, EasySIMBL, I'm talking to you.
* Fixed crash which would occur sometimes when closing documents
  while the Multi-File Search window was open.
* Subversion "Working Copy Status" results browsers are now keyed
  by the directory, so you can have more than one open (but only
  one per working copy directory).
* Fixed bug in which it was not possible to choose a Zip archive
  (or other files in Zip format, like EPUB) as the target for a
  text factory operation.
* Resolved a 12612 error which would occur when saving a document

* Flash Player, you have generated your last crash log.
* Added a build phase to strip xattrs from items in the
  application package, which solves a problem in which the OS
  creates Finder attribute files when the application is copied to
  a non-HFS file system (e.g. a `FAT`-formatted USB thumb drive)
  and in so doing renders the application's code signature invalid.
* Fixed crash which would occur when closing a live preview window
  for code containing a JavaScript `onUnload` event handler.
* Fixed crash which would occur rarely when trying to open a
  document.
* Fixed crash which would occur sometimes when using "Hard
  Wrap Text" to wrap a paragraph at the beginning of the

  state of the `ClippingsIgnoreTrailingReturns` expert
  preference.
