Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-3622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `logout.cgi` CGI application of Supermicro IPMI firmware. Specifically, it's caused by the use of `strcpy()` and `strcat()` functions without any length checks when processing the `SID` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflows:** The `strcpy()` function copies the `SID` parameter value into a 20-byte buffer without checking its length, and the `strcat()` function appends the same `SID` parameter value into a 32-byte buffer, also without any length checks. This can lead to buffer overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of these buffer overflows can lead to remote code execution on the affected system, with the privileges of the root user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `logout.cgi` endpoint on the web interface. The attacker needs to be able to reach the IPMI interface.
- **Authenticated:** The vulnerability requires an authenticated session to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker must be able to reach the IPMI interface over the network.
- An attacker must have a valid authenticated session to exploit the `logout.cgi` vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerable code snippet is provided in the content:
  ```c
  if ( cgiGetVariable("SID") )
  {
    v4 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("SID");
    strcpy(&s, v4);
  }
  ```
- Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 addresses the issue by switching to a `GetSessionCookie()` function, which limits the length of the `SID` variable and avoids the use of `strcpy()`.
