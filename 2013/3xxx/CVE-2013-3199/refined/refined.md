Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing an object in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability exists in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- This specific vulnerability (CVE-2013-3199) is one of multiple memory corruption issues addressed in the security bulletin MS13-059.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution in the context of the current user.
- If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is web-based. An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- They may also compromise legitimate websites or inject malicious content into sites that accept user-generated content or advertisements.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious page (e.g., by sending links via email, IM, or social media).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or inject a malicious web page with the exploit.
- They need to entice a user with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer to visit the page.
- No special privileges are required before the exploit. Successful exploitation grants the attacker the privileges of the user visiting the page.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) on various Windows platforms.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client versions of Windows and "Moderate" for server versions.
- This issue was not publicly known or exploited at the time the security bulletin was released.
- Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate this vulnerability on systems where it's installed and properly configured.
- Microsoft recommends applying the security update (KB2862772) to address the vulnerability.
- There are workarounds, such as setting the browser security to "High", or disabling or prompting for active scripting; however, these could affect usability.
