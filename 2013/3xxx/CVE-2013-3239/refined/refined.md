  "CVE-2013-3239": {
    "description": "phpMyAdmin can be configured to save an export file on the web server, via its SaveDir directive. With this in place, it's possible, either via a crafted filename template or a crafted table name, to save a double extension file like foobar.php.sql. In turn, an Apache webserver on which there is no definition for the MIME type \"sql\" (the default) will treat this saved file as a \".php\" script, leading to remote code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to save a file with a double extension (e.g., .php.sql), and the web server's misinterpretation of such files as executable scripts when no specific MIME type is defined for the intermediate extension (e.g., 'sql').",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of filenames during export leading to double extension vulnerability.",
       "Reliance on webserver MIME type configurations.",
      "Inadequate checks on filename extensions during export."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the server where phpMyAdmin is installed and configured to allow saved exports.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted filename templates during export.",
      "Crafted table names during export."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Authenticated access to phpMyAdmin.",
      "The SaveDir directive must be configured.",
      "The server must be running Apache with mod_mime to be exploitable."
    ]
