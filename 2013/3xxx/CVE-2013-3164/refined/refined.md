Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3164:

**CVE-2013-3164: Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** This vulnerability arises from the way Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Vulnerability:** Memory corruption vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can achieve remote code execution within the context of the current user. This means the attacker gains the same level of access as the user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the system, including installing software, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website. An attacker hosts such a site designed to exploit the vulnerability via Internet Explorer.
    *   The attacker then needs to convince the victim to visit the malicious website. This is typically achieved by:
        *   Tricking the user into clicking a link in an email or instant message.
        *   Compromising legitimate websites to host the malicious content.
        *   Using compromised ad networks to display malicious content.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website or inject malicious content into websites that a target user might visit. The attacker needs no special privileges on the target system other than the ability to convince the user to browse a malicious website using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-055.
*   The provided content indicates that at the time of the bulletin's release, Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of CVE-2013-3164. However, it is mentioned that attacks were observed exploiting CVE-2013-3163.
*   The severity is rated as "Critical" for client versions of Windows and "Moderate" for server versions. This is due to servers having Enhanced Security Configuration enabled by default which provides a level of mitigation.
*   The bulletin recommends applying the update to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The document also provides mitigation strategies such as increasing security settings or disabling Active Scripting. However, these may impact the functionality of some websites.
