Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-3201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system, including installing programs, viewing, modifying, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a user visiting a specially crafted website using Internet Explorer.
