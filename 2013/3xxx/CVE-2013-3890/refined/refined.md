Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Excel and other affected Microsoft software improperly handle objects in memory when parsing specially crafted Office files. This incorrect handling leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability that arises from improper parsing of Excel files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the user opening the malicious file.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new user accounts with full rights.
- **Compromised System:** Users with limited rights are less impacted, but still vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Email Attachments:** Attackers can send specially crafted Excel files via email, tricking users into opening them.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious Excel files on websites, enticing users to visit and open the files. Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also be used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Crafting Malicious Files:** Attackers need the ability to create specially crafted Excel files designed to exploit the memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to convince users to open the malicious files, whether through emails or enticing web links.
- **No user interaction via email**: The vulnerability cannot be automatically exploited through email and requires user interaction.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting how Microsoft Excel and other affected software validates data when parsing crafted Office files.
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2013-3889, with both involving memory corruption in Excel and leading to RCE, however the specific vulnerable code paths are different, requiring unique fixes.
- The provided documents detail which versions of Microsoft Office are affected, including Excel, compatibility packs, and viewers, and provide links to updates for these versions.
- Workarounds are suggested that involve using Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE), blocking certain file types, and user training to not open untrusted files.
- Microsoft also includes an exploitability index which helps to prioritize which security update should be deployed first.
