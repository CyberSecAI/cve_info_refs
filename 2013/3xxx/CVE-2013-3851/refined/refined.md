Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-3851:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue that occurs when Microsoft Word improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of memory during the parsing of specially crafted files leads to memory corruption, which can be exploited.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
*   **Full System Control:** If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    *   Install programs
    *   View, change, or delete data
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Files:** Attackers need to create specially crafted Microsoft Office files (specifically Word files).
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction; the user must open the malicious file for the exploit to occur.
    *   **Email:**  Attackers can send the malicious file as an email attachment.
    *   **Web-based Attack:** Attackers could host the malicious file on a website or compromised website, and trick users into opening it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create specially crafted Microsoft Word files.
*   The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to the target, either via email or by hosting it on a website and enticing the user to download and open the file.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is not exploitable automatically through email.
*   Users with fewer user rights on the system would be less affected by this vulnerability than users who operate with administrative user rights.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited at the time the security bulletin was released.
*   The fix for CVE-2013-3851 is part of a larger update that addresses multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word.
* The update for this specific CVE is included in Microsoft Office (mso) updates for Office 2003, 2007, as well as Microsoft Word 2003,2007, Compatibility Pack and Word Viewer.
