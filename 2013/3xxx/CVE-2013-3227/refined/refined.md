Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-3227:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `github.com`, `lists.opensuse.org` and `www.ubuntu.com` explicitly mentions CVE-2013-3227 in the context of Linux kernel vulnerabilities. The commit message from github contains the patch. The other content from `www.mandriva.com` is unrelated. The `lkml.org` content contains the Linux 3.9-rc7 release notes from Linus Torvalds, mentioning the fix for the underlying TLB bug, but not CVE-2013-3227 itself.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a missing initialization of the `msg_namelen` member in the `caif_seqpkt_recvmsg()` function within the Linux kernel's CAIF (Common Access Interface Framework) protocol implementation. Specifically, when a `recvmsg` or `recvfrom` system call is made, and if the `msg_name` is set, the `msg_namelen` field is not set to 0.
*   The core issue is that when the `msg_name` member is set, the `msg_namelen` member of the `msghdr` struct isn't updated. The underlying mechanism is the `net/socket.c` code which does not check `msg_namelen` which results in an uninitialized `sockaddr_storage` being passed to user space.
*   This leads to an information leak of uninitialized kernel stack memory to user space.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The primary weakness is that uninitialized kernel stack memory is exposed to user space. This memory could contain potentially sensitive data.
*   **Missing Initialization:** The vulnerability is a consequence of missing initialization.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A local, unprivileged attacker can exploit the vulnerability to read kernel stack memory. The attacker can use recvmsg()/recvfrom() system calls.
*   The leaked memory can include various types of kernel data, which could aid in further attacks, such as privilege escalation, or reveal secrets/confidential information.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is local.
*   **System Call:** The attacker needs to invoke the vulnerable `caif_seqpkt_recvmsg()` function, specifically, via `recvmsg` or `recvfrom` system calls using CAIF sockets. The `msg_name` member needs to be set to trigger the leak.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   **User Level:** The attacker does not require elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability. Any user can use the system call.
*   **Knowledge of CAIF sockets:** The attacker needs to use a caif socket to call the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The openSUSE and Ubuntu security notices indicate that this vulnerability is part of a larger set of information leaks in various kernel networking protocols. This means similar vulnerabilities existed in other functions as well.
*   The commit message from the github source provides more technical detail of the root cause.
*   The openSUSE patch addresses multiple CVEs including CVE-2013-3227.
*   The ubuntu notice also mentions the fix to tkill/tgkill, which was fixed under CVE-2013-2141.

In summary, CVE-2013-3227 is a local information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's CAIF protocol implementation that allows an unprivileged local user to read kernel stack memory via the `recvmsg`/`recvfrom` system calls by setting the `msg_name` member, due to a missing `msg_namelen` initialization.
