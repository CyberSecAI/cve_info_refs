- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An information disclosure issue existed in the `mach_port_space_info` API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Kernel stack memory may be disclosed. The iin_collision field in structures returned from the kernel was not being initialized.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unprivileged processes could get access to the contents of kernel memory which could potentially lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious local application could exploit the vulnerability by calling the `mach_port_space_info` API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code locally on the device with an unprivileged account.
