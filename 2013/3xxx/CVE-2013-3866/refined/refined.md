Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3866:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) improperly handling objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Improper memory object handling in the Windows kernel-mode driver

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can gain elevated privileges, potentially achieving kernel-mode code execution.
*   **Arbitrary Kernel Memory Read:** An attacker could read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory, exposing sensitive information.
*   **System Compromise (Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, 7, Server 2008 R2):** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.
*    **Denial of Service (Windows 8, Server 2012):** An attacker could cause the target system to stop responding, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local Access: The attacker must have valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Exploitation through a crafted application: After logging on, an attacker would run a specially crafted application designed to exploit the memory handling issue and elevate privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Valid logon credentials on the target system.
*   Ability to execute programs locally on the target system.
*   Knowledge or access to a crafted application that can trigger the memory handling vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the win32k.sys driver, which is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem responsible for window management, screen output, input collection, and graphics functions.
*   Microsoft was not aware of public disclosure or active exploitation of this vulnerability when the security bulletin was released.
*   The vulnerability affects various versions of Windows, from XP to Windows Server 2012.

This detailed analysis provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and how an attacker could exploit it. The affected systems and the steps needed for mitigation are also well documented within the provided text.
