Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-3208:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Internet Explorer improperly handles objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption: The core issue is the corruption of memory due to improper object handling.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can exploit the memory corruption to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege escalation: If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, potentially leading to installation of programs, data modification or deletion, and creation of new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: Attackers can host specially crafted websites designed to exploit the vulnerability. They could also leverage compromised websites or those that host user-provided content/ads.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to convince users to visit the malicious website, typically through links in emails or instant messages. Alternatively, they could get users to open malicious email attachments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into legitimate websites.
- Ability to convince users to visit the malicious website or open malicious email attachments.
- No special privileges required on the victim's machine prior to exploitation

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is part of a group of memory corruption issues addressed in the MS13-069 security bulletin.
- The severity is rated as Critical for client systems and Moderate for server systems for the affected versions of Internet Explorer.
- Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Servers provides some mitigation.
- The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate exploitation attempts.
