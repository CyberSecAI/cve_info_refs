Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3996:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is not explicitly stated but it is related to vulnerabilities in IBM InfoSphere BigInsights which are described as cross-site scripting, phishing through frames, and cross-site request forgery.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerabilities present include:
*   Cross-site scripting (XSS)
*   Phishing through frames (potentially an IFrame injection issue)
*   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
*   Execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser (XSS).
*   Impersonate a legitimate site to steal user credentials (phishing).
*   Perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user (CSRF).

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors include:
*   Injecting malicious code through input fields or URLs, which are then rendered within the application's web interface (XSS).
*   Inserting malicious frames into the application's web pages to trick users into submitting credentials or data to the attacker's site (phishing).
*   Tricking a user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a crafted web page which will then make a request on their behalf on the targeted web application (CSRF)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious code, craft malicious frames, or manipulate requests in the context of the vulnerable application. 
*  The attacker would need the target user to visit a crafted page, or click on a malicious link to perform CSRF attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerabilities affect IBM Db2 Big SQL, specifically versions 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 2.0.0, and 2.1.0, both Enterprise and Basic Editions, running on Linux.
*   This IBM Security Bulletin also mentions CVE-2013-3995 and CVE-2013-3992 indicating other related vulnerabilities.
*   The provided content from flexera.com does not contain vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3996 and is therefore not relevant to this CVE.
