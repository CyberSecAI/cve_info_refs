        "details": "The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer that can lead to remote code execution. When Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\n\n- **Root cause:** Improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.\n- **Weaknesses:** Memory corruption vulnerability.\n- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system.\n- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to convince a user to visit the site. This could be done through phishing emails or by compromising websites that the user visits.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host malicious content on a webpage and entice a user to visit it using Internet Explorer."
