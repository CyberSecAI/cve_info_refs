The provided document is a security bulletin that lists multiple vulnerabilities affecting various IBM products, including Maximo Asset Management, Tivoli Service Request Manager, and others. Although it mentions several vulnerability types, it does not specifically identify which vulnerability corresponds to CVE-2013-3047. It only provides a high-level overview.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Privilege Escalation
- SQL Injection
- Information Disclosure

**Affected Products:**
- IBM Maximo Asset Management
- Maximo Asset Management Essentials
- Maximo for Government

- Maximo for Transportation
- Maximo for Life Sciences
- Maximo for Oil and Gas
- Maximo for Utilities
- Tivoli Service Request Manager
- Maximo Asset Management for IT
- Tivoli Change and Configuration Management Database
- IBM Control Desk

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The bulletin indicates that exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
- Unauthorized execution of scripts (XSS)
- Unauthorized privilege gain
- Data breaches or manipulation through SQL injection
- Exposure of sensitive information

**Attack Vectors & Required Capabilities:**
The document does not provide specific attack vectors or required attacker capabilities for each vulnerability. However, based on common vulnerability types, some general assumptions can be made:
- XSS: Requires the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application. Usually this occurs through the manipulation of user supplied data.
- Privilege Escalation: This would require the attacker to have some level of access to the system, then elevate their privileges to perform actions they should not be authorized to do.
- SQL Injection: Requires the attacker to manipulate database queries through user input or another way, which would then result in unintended database behavior.
- Information Disclosure: Usually requires some sort of read access or API access to the system.

**Summary:**
The document describes multiple security vulnerabilities across various IBM products, but it does not specify which vulnerability corresponds to CVE-2013-3047. It provides a broad overview of different vulnerability types (XSS, privilege escalation, SQL injection, and information disclosure) and their potential impacts on the listed products. Therefore, it does not provide detailed information for CVE-2013-3047, but it does confirm that such vulnerabilities exist within the affected IBM products during the period of this security bulletin.
