The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the Jomres component for Joomla!.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
1.  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "property_name" POST parameter.
2.  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "id" GET parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Script Insertion (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS):**  Unsanitized input in the "property_name" POST parameter allows injecting arbitrary HTML and script code.
2.  **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized input in the "id" GET parameter allows manipulating SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **XSS:** Malicious scripts are executed in the browser session of users viewing the injected content, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
2.  **SQL Injection:**  Attackers can manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **XSS:** Sending a POST request with a malicious "property_name" parameter when editing property details.
2.  **SQL Injection:** Sending a GET request to `administrator/index.php` with the `option` set to `com_jomres`, `task` set to `editProfile`, and a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have "Business Manager" permissions to exploit these vulnerabilities.
