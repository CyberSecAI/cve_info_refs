- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation or sanitization of user-controlled data, allowing for HTTP response splitting and open redirects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTTP response splitting and open redirect vulnerabilities are present. These allow an attacker to manipulate the HTTP response to inject malicious content and redirect users to arbitrary websites.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to several negative impacts:
    - **Phishing**: An attacker could redirect users to a malicious website designed to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
    - **Malware distribution**: Attackers can use the redirect to deliver malware to unsuspecting users.
    - **Session hijacking**:  Response splitting may allow attackers to manipulate headers which may be used for session management.
    - **Defacement**: Attackers may alter the content presented to users to cause reputational damage.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves crafting malicious requests that manipulate HTTP responses.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable server. This could be achieved if the attacker can interact directly with the server, or through an intermediary.
