```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `llc_ui_recvmsg` function in the Linux kernel's LLC (Logical Link Control) implementation fails to update the `msg_namelen` member of the `msghdr` structure, leading to a kernel stack memory leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The function does not properly initialize the `msg_namelen` member before potentially filling the `msg_name` member when receiving a message on a stream socket or when a datagram socket is shutting down during receive."
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can potentially leak 128 bytes of kernel stack memory through a crafted `recvmsg(2)` or `recvfrom(2)` system call.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A local user can exploit this flaw using the `recvmsg(2)` or `recvfrom(2)` system calls with crafted requests to expose kernel stack memory."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A local user with the ability to execute programs on the affected system can trigger this vulnerability."
