The provided content is related to CVE-2013-3241.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The export script in phpMyAdmin generates global variables from the `$_POST` superglobal. This can allow an attacker to overwrite existing global variables, potentially leading to further exploits within the export script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of user-supplied data through the `$_POST` superglobal.
- Global variable overwriting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can overwrite global variables, potentially leading to further exploits within the export script. The specific impact depends on what variables can be overwritten and how these variables are used within the export script.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending malicious `POST` requests to the export script, with the intent of overwriting specific global variables.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of phpMyAdmin due to token protection.
