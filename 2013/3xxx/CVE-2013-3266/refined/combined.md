How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : kfreebsd-9
Vulnerability  : interpretation conflict
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-3266
Debian Bug     : 706414

Adam Nowacki discovered that the new FreeBSD NFS implementation
processes a crafted READDIR request which instructs to operate a file
system on a file node as if it were a directory node, leading to a
kernel crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.

The kfreebsd-8 kernel in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) does not
enable the new NFS implementation.  The Linux kernel is not affected
by this vulnerability.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.1.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 9.0-11.

We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

FreeBSD-SA-13:05.nfsserver Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Insufficient input validation in the NFS server

Module: nfsserver
Announced: 2013-04-29

CVE Name: CVE-2013-3266
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
0. Revision History
v1.0 2013-04-29 Initial release.
v1.1 2013-04-29 Corrected patch URL.
Additional workaround information.
I. Background
The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of its
file systems so that other hosts can access them over the network and mount
them as if they were on local disks. FreeBSD includes server and client
implementations of NFS.
FreeBSD 8.0 and onward has two NFS implementations: the original CSRG
NFSv2 and NFSv3 implementation and a new implementation which also
supports NFSv4.
FreeBSD 9.0 and onward uses the new NFS implementation by default.
II. Problem Description
When processing READDIR requests, the NFS server does not check that
it is in fact operating on a directory node. An attacker can use a
specially modified NFS client to submit a READDIR request on a file,
causing the underlying filesystem to interpret that file as a
directory.
III. Impact
The exact consequences of an attack depend on the amount of input
validation in the underlying filesystem:
- If the file resides on a UFS filesystem on a little-endian server,
an attacker can cause random heap corruption with completely
unpredictable consequences.
- If the file resides on a ZFS filesystem, an attacker can write
arbitrary data on the stack. It is believed, but has not been
confirmed, that this can be exploited to run arbitrary code in
kernel context.
Other filesystems may also be vulnerable.
IV. Workaround
Systems that do not provide NFS service are not vulnerable. Neither
are systems that do but use the old NFS implementation, which is the
default in FreeBSD 8.x.
To determine which implementation an NFS server is running, run the
following command:
# kldstat -v | grep -cw nfsd
This will print 1 if the system is running the new NFS implementation,
and 0 otherwise.
To switch to the old NFS implementation:
1) Append the following lines to /etc/rc.conf:
nfsv4\_server\_enable="no"
oldnfs\_server\_enable="yes"
2) If the NFS server is compiled into the kernel (which is the case
for the stock GENERIC kernel), replace the NFSD option with the
NFSSERVER option, then recompile your kernel as described in
.
If the NFS server is not compiled into the kernel, the correct
module will be loaded at boot time.
3) Finally, reboot the system.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:05/nfsserver.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:05/nfsserver.patch.asc
# gpg --verify nfsserver.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the revision numbers of each file that was
corrected in FreeBSD.
