- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the `customerId` query string parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML, including malicious JavaScript, into a web page. This could lead to stealing user authentication cookies or other sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript in the `customerId` query string parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link to the vulnerable page, potentially via email, another website, or social media.
