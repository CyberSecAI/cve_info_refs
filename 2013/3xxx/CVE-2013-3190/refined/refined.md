Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2013-3190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability.  Specifically, improper handling of objects in memory within Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. This means the attacker gains the same privileges as the user running Internet Explorer.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, or create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability or leverage compromised websites and those that accept user-provided content.
- **Social Engineering:**  Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious website, typically through links in emails or instant messages or by opening email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into existing websites.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website through social engineering.
- No special privileges are required beyond gaining the user's context after successful exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
- This CVE is one of multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-059.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer, including versions 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
- Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit the vulnerability.
