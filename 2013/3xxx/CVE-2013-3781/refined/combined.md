# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 89 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapril2013verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2013 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1548709.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1548709.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1).

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-061 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2876063)

Published: August 13, 2013 | Updated: August 27, 2013

**Version:** 3.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server. The vulnerabilities exist in the WebReady Document Viewing and Data Loss Prevention features of Microsoft Exchange Server. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution in the security context of the transcoding service on the Exchange server if a user previews a specially crafted file using Outlook Web App (OWA). The transcoding service in Exchange that is used for WebReady Document Viewing uses the credentials of the LocalService account. The Data Loss Prevention feature hosts code that could allow remote code execution in the security context of the Filtering Management service if a specially crafted message is received by the Exchange server. The Filtering Management service in Exchange uses the credentials of the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local system and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, and Microsoft Exchange Server 2013. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by updating the affected Oracle Outside In libraries to a non-vulnerable version. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerabilities entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

## Oracle Outside In Contains Multiple Exploitable Vulnerabilities

Two of the three vulnerabilities addressed in this bulletin, CVE-2013-2393 and CVE-2013-3776, exist in Exchange Server 2007, Exchange Server 2010, and Exchange Server 2013 through the WebReady Document Viewing feature. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution as the LocalService account if a user views a specially crafted file through Outlook Web Access in a browser. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run code on the affected Exchange Server, but only as the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2013-3781, exists in Exchange Server 2013 through the Data Loss Protection (DLP) feature. This vulnerability could cause the affected Exchange Server to become unresponsive if a user views a specially crafted file through Outlook Web Access in a browser.

To view these vulnerabilities as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-2393](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-2393), [CVE-2013-3776](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3776), and [CVE-2013-3781](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3781).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The transcoding service in Exchange that is used for WebReady Document Viewing is running in the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network. This is a mitigating factor for CVE-2013-3776 and CVE-2013-3781.
* The Filtering Management service in Exchange that is used for Data Loss Prevention is running in the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimum privileges on the local system and presents anonymous credentials on the network. This is a mitigating factor for CVE-2013-3776 and CVE-2013-3781

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable Data Loss Prevention (Exchange Server 2013 only)**

  1. Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
  2. Issue one of the following PowerShell commands depending upon the version of Exchange Server 2013 installed:

     For Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 1:

     `%SystemDrive%\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\Scripts\Disable-OutsideIn.ps1`

     For Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 2:

     `Set-TextExtractionScanSettings -EnableModules AdeModule.dll, FilterModule.dll, TextConversionModule.dll`

  **Impact of workaround.** DLP policies that depend on the Outside In libraries will not function. The script provided for Cumulative Update 1 will cause the Transport and Filtering Management services to restart.

  **How do I undo the workaround?**

  1. Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
  2. Issue one of the following PowerShell commands, depending on the version of Exchange Server 2013 installed:

     For Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 1:

     `%SystemDrive%\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\Scripts\Enable-OutsideIn.ps1`

     For Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 2:

     `Set-TextExtractionScanSettings -EnableModules AdeModule.dll, FilterModule.dll, TextConversionModule.dll, OutsideInModule.dll`
* **Disable WebReady document view**

  1. Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
  2. Issue the following PowerShell command:

     ```
     Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010' -or
     $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2013'} | Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -
     WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$False -
     WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$False

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** OWA users may not be able to preview the content of email attachments.

  **How do I undo the workaround?**

  1. Log in to the Exchange Management Shell as an Exchange Organization Administrator.
  2. Issue the following PowerShell command:

     ```
     Get-OwaVirtualDirectory | where {$_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2007' -or $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2010' -or
     $_.OwaVersion -eq 'Exchange2013'} | Set-OwaVirtualDirectory -
     WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPublicComputersEnabled:$True -
     WebReadyDocumentViewingOnPrivateComputersEnabled:$True

     ```

  **Note** The above steps assume the Exchange Administrator had previously allowed WebReady Documents to be viewed on both Public and Private logons to OWA. The appropriate $True or $False value should be used to set the desired behavior based upon user logon.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?**

These are remote code execution vulnerabilities.

**What causes the vulnerabilities?**

The vulnerabilities are caused when the Oracle Outside In libraries parse specially crafted files.

**What are the Oracle Outside In libraries?**

In Exchange Server 2007, Exchange Server 2010, and Exchange Server 2013, Outlook Web App (OWA) users are provided with a feature called WebReady Document Viewing that allows users to view certain attachments as webpages instead of relying on local applications to open or view them. The Oracle Outside In libraries are used by the conversion process on the server backend to support the WebReady feature. Microsoft licenses these libraries from Oracle.

In Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Data Loss Prevention (DLP) leverages the Oracle Outside In libraries as part of its file scanning capabilities.

**What is WebReady Document Viewing?**

WebReady Document Viewing allows users to view certain attachments as a webpage. Exchange 2007, Exchange 2010, and Exchange 2013 do the conversion, so the user does not need anything other than a web browser to view the attachments.

**What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?**

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is a feature of Exchange 2013 that allows customers to identify, monitor, and protect sensitive data through deep content analysis.

**What might an attacker use these vulnerabilities to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code as LocalService on the affected Exchange server. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or take any other action that the server process has access to do.

**How could an attacker exploit these vulnerabilities?**

An attacker could send an email message containing a specially crafted file to a user on an affected Exchange server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Systems running affected versions of Exchange Server are primarily at risk from these vulnerabilities.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by updating the affected Oracle Outside In libraries to a non-vulnerable version.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had these vulnerabilities been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. These vulnerabilities have been publicly disclosed. They have been assigned the following Common Vulnerability and Exposure numbers:

* [CVE-2013-2393](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-2393)

* [CVE-2013-3781](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3781)

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that these vulnerabilities were being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that these vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 89 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2013 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1548709.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1548709.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.
