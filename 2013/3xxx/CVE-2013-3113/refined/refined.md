    "summary": "The provided documents detail CVE-2013-3113, a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer that could allow remote code execution. The vulnerability is triggered by improper handling of objects in memory. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user. The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage that the user is tricked into visiting. This vulnerability was part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-047.",

        "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user, potentially gaining the same user rights. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "A specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability via Internet Explorer.",
          "Compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content/advertisements can be used to host the malicious content."

        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious website (e.g., through links in email or instant messages, or by opening an attachment sent via email). No user interaction is needed once the page is loaded.",
        "additional_info": "This vulnerability is one of multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed in the same update. The severity of the vulnerability is rated as Critical for client versions of Windows and Moderate for server versions. Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers mitigates this vulnerability for websites not added to the trusted sites zone. The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed, nor was there any known exploitation of it prior to the release of this bulletin."
