Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw located within the `gp_LoadUserFromHash` function in the `functions_hash.php` file of the WHMCS Group Pay plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `gp_LoadUserFromHash` function directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$hash`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically, the `$hash` variable is used in the following SQL query:
    ```sql
    SELECT `id` from tblclients where md5(CONCAT(id,email)) = '$hash'
    ```
    This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code through the `$hash` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to:
    *   **Extract sensitive data:** Access and potentially steal data from the `tblclients` table or other database tables, including user IDs, emails, and potentially other sensitive customer information.
    *   **Modify data:** Alter or delete data within the database.
    *   **Gain unauthorized access:** Potentially escalate privileges or gain control over the application or underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `grouppay.php` script's `hash` parameter in the URL. A malicious SQL injection payload is appended to the `hash` parameter like `grouppay.php?hash=%hash%' and '1'='1`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `grouppay.php` script with a crafted `hash` parameter value.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated and could be external.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code shows that the vulnerability can be triggered using a payload like `grouppay.php?hash=%hash%' and '1'='1`.
*   The vulnerability exists because the function does not properly escape user-provided input (`$hash`) before using it in a SQL query.
*   The fix involves using `mysql_real_escape_string()` to sanitize the `$hash` variable before using it in the query:
    ```php
    $hash = mysql_real_escape_string($hash);
    ```
* The vulnerable plugin is WHMCompleteSolution (WHMCS) Group Pay Plugin 1.5 and prior.
