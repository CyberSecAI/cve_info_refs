Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that Internet Explorer's memory management is flawed, allowing for corruption. This can be triggered when handling objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains full control over the system, allowing them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also inject malicious content into compromised websites or sites that allow user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince the victim to visit the malicious website. This often involves tricking them into clicking a link in an email or instant message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or control content that can be rendered by Internet Explorer.
- They must be able to convince users to interact with this malicious content.
- No specific position or capability is stated beyond the ability to serve malicious content to a user with a vulnerable browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content references multiple other CVEs which relate to other memory corruption vulnerabilities and a cross site scripting vulnerability in the same July 2013 Microsoft Security Bulletin.
- The provided document also includes mitigating factors, and workarounds which may reduce the impact of exploitation.
- The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
