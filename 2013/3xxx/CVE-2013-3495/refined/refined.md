Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-3495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Intel VT-d (Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O) handles Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI). Specifically, malformed MSI requests, which are writes to a specific address range (0xFEE?????) without proper MSI attributes, can trigger a system error.
*   When System Error Reporting (SERR) is enabled in the Host Bridge device (a common configuration), these malformed MSIs cause a PCI system error (SERR#) that is delivered as a Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI). This NMI can bypass VT-d's interrupt remapping protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate the attributes of MSI requests before processing them, allowing malformed requests to trigger errors.
*   **Bypass of VT-d Protection:** The use of native NMIs to report SERR bypasses the interrupt remapping protection provided by VT-d, which is designed to isolate virtual machines from directly influencing hardware interrupts.
*   **Reliance on SERR:** The system's reliance on SERR, specifically through NMIs, becomes a vulnerability when the events that trigger SERR can be initiated by a malicious guest.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious virtual machine (domain) with access to a bus mastering-capable PCI device can trigger the vulnerability. By sending malformed MSIs, it can cause NMIs to be generated repeatedly, leading to a system-wide denial-of-service condition or system halt ("panic").

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **PCI Passthrough:** The attacker requires access to a PCI device assigned to the malicious virtual machine using PCI passthrough (VT-d).
*   **Malformed MSI:** The attacker needs to be able to send malformed MSI requests from the assigned device.
*   **SERR Enabled:** The underlying hardware must have System Error Reporting (SERR) enabled in the Host Bridge device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Virtual Machine Access:** The attacker must have control over a virtual machine running on the vulnerable system.
*   **PCI Device Access:** The attacker's virtual machine must have a PCI device assigned using PCI passthrough, and the device must be capable of bus mastering to initiate DMA transfers and send MSI.
*   **Knowledge of MSI:** The attacker must be able to craft malformed MSI requests.

**Mitigation and Workarounds:**

*   **Avoid Untrusted Guests:** The primary mitigation is to not assign PCI devices to untrusted virtual machines, which can be difficult in cloud-based environments.
*   **Disable SERR:** A workaround involves disabling SERR in the Host Bridge device by clearing the SERRE bit in the PCICMD register of the Host Bridge. This will prevent all SERR messages generated by the Host Bridge.
*   **Mask Unsupported Request Errors:** Another workaround is to block SERR error signaling due to "Unsupported Request" errors by setting a specific bit in the memory configuration register (DMIUEMSK) of the Root Complex Register Range.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Xen versions 3.3 onwards.
*   The issue affects systems using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough and the system firmware (BIOS) may enable SERR.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gábor PÉK from CrySyS Lab.
