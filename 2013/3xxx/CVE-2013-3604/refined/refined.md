Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insufficient input sanitization and output encoding in the Coursemill Learning Management System. Specifically, the application does not properly filter user-provided input in several application inputs, leading to stored XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks due to inadequate input validation. User-provided input is stored and later displayed without proper sanitization.
    *   Coursemill 6.8 adds a filter for closing quotes, but it is insufficient and does not filter other inputs like "%22".

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's database. When other users view the stored data, this malicious script will be executed in their browsers.
*   This can lead to various impacts, including:
    *   **Information Leakage:** Attackers could steal cookies or session tokens.
    *   **Account Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially gain control of user accounts.
    *   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victimized user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through crafted input that is saved by the application and then rendered to other users.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the application displays the attacker-controlled stored input to other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to input data into the vulnerable application fields. This typically implies having an account on the Coursemill platform or leveraging another vulnerability to insert data.
*   The attacker needs to craft malicious JavaScript payloads that will be executed when a user views the attacker's data.
