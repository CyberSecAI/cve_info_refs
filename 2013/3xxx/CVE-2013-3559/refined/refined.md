    "summary": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way ASN.1 BER dissector of Wireshark processed certain ASN.1 BER packet capture files. Remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted ASN.1 BER packet capture file that, when processed would lead to tshark executable crash. An integer overflow flaw was found in the way DCP ETSI dissector of Wireshark processed certain DCP ETSI packet capture files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted DCP ETSI packet capture file that, when processed, would lead to tshark executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running tshark binary.",
