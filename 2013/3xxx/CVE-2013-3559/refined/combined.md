| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=965193#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-20 16:29:55 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way ASN.1 BER dissector of Wireshark, a network traffic analyzer, processed certain ASN.1 BER packet capture files. Remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted ASN.1 BER packet capture file that, when processed would lead to tshark executable crash.  Upstream bug report: [1] <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8599>  Reproducer: [2] <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=8599#c0> [3] <http://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/captures/fuzz-2013-04-20-29140.pcap>  Upstream patches: [4] <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=48943> [5] <http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=48944>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=965193#c1)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2013-05-22 11:27:12 UTC  ``` As per <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q2/378> , this issue has been split into two CVEs, the following explanation has been given by MITRE:  "Use [CVE-2013-3556](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-3556) for the [Bug 8599](show_bug.cgi?id=8599 "CLOSED WORKSFORME - rpc.rstatd forgot to set AF_INET in raw sendmsg. Fix it!") issue addressed in r48943.  Use [CVE-2013-3557](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-3557) for the [Bug 8599](show_bug.cgi?id=8599 "CLOSED WORKSFORME - rpc.rstatd forgot to set AF_INET in raw sendmsg. Fix it!") issue addressed in r48944.  It is possible that [CVE-2013-3556](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-3556) only affects people who made their own builds from the Wireshark trunk, and does not affect users of any Wireshark release. Although MITRE does not always assign CVE names for such development-code issues, in this case it is useful for clarifying the scope of [CVE-2013-3557](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-3557)."  This bug is being used for [CVE-2013-3557](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-3557).

## Topic

Updated wireshark packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer. It is used to capture and browse
the traffic running on a computer network.

Multiple flaws were found in Wireshark. If Wireshark read a malformed
packet off a network or opened a malicious dump file, it could crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark.
(CVE-2013-3559, CVE-2013-4083, CVE-2014-2281, CVE-2014-2299)

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2012-5595, CVE-2012-5598, CVE-2012-5599,
CVE-2012-5600, CVE-2012-6056, CVE-2012-6060, CVE-2012-6061, CVE-2012-6062,
CVE-2013-3557, CVE-2013-4081, CVE-2013-4927, CVE-2013-4931, CVE-2013-4932,
CVE-2013-4933, CVE-2013-4934, CVE-2013-4935, CVE-2013-5721, CVE-2013-7112)

All Wireshark users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running instances
of Wireshark must be restarted for the update to take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=965190#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2013-05-20 16:27:16 UTC  ``` An integer overflow flaw was found in the way DCP ETSI dissector of Wireshark, a network traffic analyzer, processed certain DCP ETSI packet capture files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted DCP ETSI packet capture file that, when processed, would lead to tshark executable crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running tshark binary.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
