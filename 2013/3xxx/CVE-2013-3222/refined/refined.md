{
  "CVE-2013-3222": {
    "description": "The vcc_recvmsg function in net/atm/common.c in the Linux kernel did not initialize a certain length variable, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a crafted recvmsg or recvfrom system call.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `vcc_recvmsg` function in `net/atm/common.c` did not initialize a length variable. Specifically, the `msg->msg_namelen` field was not being set to 0 when `msg->msg_name` was not set before calling `net/socket.c`, which resulted in an information leak.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uninitialized variable",
        "Information Leak"
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory. Specifically, 128 bytes of kernel stack memory can be leaked to userland.",
      "attack_vector": "A local user can exploit this via a crafted `recvmsg` or `recvfrom` system call.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local, unprivileged user capable of making syscalls.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability is located in the Linux kernel's ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) networking implementation.\nThe fix involves explicitly setting `msg->msg_namelen` to 0 when `msg->msg_name` is not set in the `vcc_recvmsg` function."
