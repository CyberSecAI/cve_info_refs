Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-3963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Grandstream IP cameras' web interface being susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The web interface does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate web interface parameters by sending a crafted CSRF vector.
- In the provided example, an attacker can add a new user with administrator privileges by sending a crafted GET request.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted GET request sent to the vulnerable web interface of the camera.
- This request is designed to exploit the lack of CSRF protection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page or interact with a malicious link containing the crafted GET request.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the vulnerable device if the device is accessible from the internet.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) URL demonstrates how an attacker can add a new administrative user by crafting a GET request with specific parameters: `http://xx.xx.xx.xx/goform/usermanage?cmd=add&user.name=test3&user.password=test3&user.level=0`.

**Affected Products:**
- The following Grandstream products are affected: GXV3501, GXV3504, GXV3601, GXV3601HD/LL, GXV3611HD/LL, GXV3615W/P, GXV3651FHD, GXV3662HD, GXV3615WP_HD and GXV3500.
