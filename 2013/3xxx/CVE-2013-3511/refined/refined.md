        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated or a low-privileged user. They need the ability to craft HTTP requests and potentially manipulate Referer headers. For some attacks, a valid cookie (JOSSO SSO) with low-privileged access is required.",
         "additional_details": "The vulnerability note provides significantly more details than a basic CVE description would, detailing multiple vulnerabilities across several components, including the foundation webapp, MONARCH component, Nagios-App component and performance component. It also specifies the use of referer header checks as primary means of security, which is a weak practice. Furthermore, it lists the affected versions as 6.7.0 and possibly earlier versions"
