Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3230:

**CVE Description:** An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's l2tp (Layer Two Tunneling Protocol) implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The L2TP code for IPv6 failed to initialize the `l2tp_conn_id` member of the `sockaddr_l2tpip6` structure. This uninitialized value, located on the kernel stack, could be exposed when the socket address information was copied during `recvmsg(2)` or `recvfrom(2)` system calls, if `msg_name` was set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** Kernel stack memory, specifically the uninitialized `l2tp_conn_id`, could be leaked to a user-space process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive kernel memory, which might contain information useful for further attacks or provide insights into the kernel's internal state. The leaked data was limited to 4 bytes in this specific case due to the size of `l2tp_conn_id`. However, other protocols had leaks up to 128 bytes of kernel stack memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **System Calls:** The attacker needs to make use of `recvmsg(2)` or `recvfrom(2)` system calls.
- **L2TP over IPv6:** The vulnerability affects the L2TP implementation over IPv6.
- **`msg_name` Set:** The `msg_name` parameter needs to be set to trigger the leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unprivileged user on the system.
- Ability to create and interact with L2TP IPv6 sockets.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability existed since the introduction of socket address information passing in Linux v1.1.20 (v1.3.16 for recvmsg).
- The fix was to initialize the `l2tp_conn_id` member with 0.
- Other similar information leaks existed within the same timeframe related to other networking protocols.
- The fix was included in Linux kernel version 3.9-rc7.
- openSUSE and Ubuntu issued security updates to address this vulnerability.
