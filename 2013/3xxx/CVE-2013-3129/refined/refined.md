      "vulnerability": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected Windows components and other affected software handle specially crafted TrueType font files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views shared content that embeds TrueType font files.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Windows, Office, Visual Studio, or Lync fails to properly handle specially crafted TrueType Fonts (TTF) files.",
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability through Windows GDI+ and Windows components could run arbitrary code in kernel mode and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability through Microsoft Office, Microsoft Visual Studio, or Microsoft Lync could gain the same user rights as the current user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system.",
    "attack_vector": "There are multiple means that could allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability, including a web-based attack scenario (specially crafted website), a file sharing attack scenario (specially crafted document), or local attack scenario (specially crafted application).",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email."
