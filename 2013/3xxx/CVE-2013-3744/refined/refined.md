  "cve": "CVE-2013-3744",
  "description": "The Javadoc tool in Oracle Java SE 7 before Update 25 is vulnerable to frame injection. When hosted on a web server, API documentation in HTML format generated by the Javadoc tool that contains a right frame is vulnerable to frame injection. This vulnerability allows an attacker to replace a frame within a Javadoc-generated page with a malicious one, potentially for phishing or social engineering attacks, or for further browser exploitation when combined with other vulnerabilities.",
  "information": {
    "root_cause": "The Javadoc tool's generated HTML for API documentation with a right frame lacks proper sanitization, allowing frame injection.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Frame Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious content into a frame within Javadoc-generated web pages. This can lead to:\n\t- Phishing attempts\n\t- Social engineering attacks\n\t- Browser exploitation if combined with other browser-related vulnerabilities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker injects malicious content when a user visits a vulnerable Javadoc page that is hosted on a web server"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host malicious content on a server and then somehow trick the victim into visiting the vulnerable Javadoc page."
