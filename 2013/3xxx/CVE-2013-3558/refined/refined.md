Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the PPP CCP (Point-to-Point Protocol Compression Control Protocol) dissector in Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The PPP CCP dissector is susceptible to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause Wireshark to crash. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the user trying to analyze network traffic with Wireshark.
- Potentially, the crash can occur when processing a malformed packet received over the network or when reading a specially crafted capture file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can send a malformed PPP CCP packet over the network. If a user is capturing this traffic with Wireshark, it will crash the application.
- **Malicious Capture File:** An attacker can create a malicious capture file containing a malformed PPP CCP packet. If a user opens this capture file with Wireshark, the application will crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject network traffic or provide a malicious capture file to the victim.
- There are no specific privilege or position requirements for the attacker other than the ability to deliver the malicious packet or file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was identified as wnpa-sec-2013-26 by the Wireshark project.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.8.0 through 1.8.6.
- It was fixed in Wireshark version 1.8.7.
- The bug report for the issue was filed as bug 8638 in the Wireshark bug tracker.
- This vulnerability is also addressed in openSUSE security updates.

In summary, CVE-2013-3558 describes a crash vulnerability in Wireshark's PPP CCP dissector that can be triggered by malformed packets, leading to a denial of service.
