# Security Vulnerability - May 2013 Novell Client for Windows Zero Day disclosures

* **Document ID:***7012497*
* **Creation Date:**28-May-2013
* **Modified Date:**10-Jun-2013
* + **Micro Focus Products:**Client for Open Enterprise Server (Novell Client)

## Environment

 Novell Client for Windows

## Situation

 Two "Zero Day" disclosures were posted on May 10th and May 22nd, 2013:

1. The NICM.SYS kernel driver installed by Novell Client for Windows on the Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 platforms contains a hijack of execution vulnerability in the handling of IOCTL 0x143B6B.  Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within a kernel execution context.  An attacker would need local access to a vulnerable computer to exploit this vulnerability.

[Original disclosure and details](http://www.eeye.com/resources/security-center/research/zero-day-tracker/2013/20130522).

This issue is also present in the Novell Client for Windows XP/2003, although there are additional factors which significantly mitigate and block the ability to successfully exploit the issue as compared to the Windows 7 platforms.

2. The NWFS.SYS kernel driver installed by Novell Client for Windows XP/2003 contains an integer overflow vulnerability in the handling of IOCTL 0x1439EB and other IOCTLs.  Exploitation of this issue potentially allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel, if they also mount a successful kernel pool attack against Windows itself.  An attacker would need local access to a vulnerable computer to exploit this vulnerability.

[Original disclosure and details](http://www.eeye.com/resources/security-center/research/zero-day-tracker/2013/20130510).

This issue is also present in the NCPL.SYS kernel driver installed by Novell Client for Windows on the Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 platforms.

All versions of the Novell Client for Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 are affected up to and including Novell Client 2 SP3 for Windows (IR1a) and Novell Client 2 SP2 (IR6).

All versions of the Novell Client for Windows XP/2003 are affected, up to and including the Novell Client 4.91 SP5 for Windows XP/2003 (IR1) with or without the "Novell Client 4.91 Post-SP5 (IR1) NWFS.SYS 3" update installed.

## Resolution

 For Novell Client 2 SP3 for Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 2008 R2, and Windows 2012, the fix is located in the [Novell Client 2 SP3 for Windows (IR2)](https://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=ck8iQRr2ooc%7E).

For Novell Client 2 SP2 for Windows Vista and Windows 2008, the fix is located in the [Novell Client 2 SP2 for Windows (IR6a)](https://download.novell.com/Download?buildid=4LymmsBuXy0%7E).

For Novell Client 4.91 SP5 for Windows XP/2003, the fix is located in [Novell Client 4.91 Post-SP5 (IR1) NWFS.SYS 5](https://download.novell.com/protected/Summary.jsp?buildid=jHDTLHptZVY%7E).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
