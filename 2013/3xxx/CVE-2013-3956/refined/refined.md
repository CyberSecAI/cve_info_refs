  "CVE-2013-3956": {
    "description": "The nicm.sys kernel driver distributed with Novell Client for Windows 7,8 contains a hijack of execution vulnerability in the handling of IOCTL 0x143B6B. Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel. An attacker would need local access to a vulnerable computer to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `nicm.sys` driver's handling of IOCTL 0x143B6B. Specifically, a user-supplied pointer is dereferenced and used as a function pointer, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unvalidated user-controlled pointer",
        "Direct pointer dereference",
        "Lack of input validation"
      ],
       "impact": "Arbitrary code execution within the kernel.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the vulnerable machine is required",
         "Sending a crafted IOCTL request to the vulnerable driver"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Local access with the ability to send IOCTL requests to device drivers."
    },
    "affected_applications": [
      "Novell Client 2 SP3 for Windows 7,8 (up-to date)",
      "nicm.sys version 3.1.11.0"
    ],
    "additional_notes": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered when the `nicm.sys` driver receives IOCTL code `0x143B6B`.",
        "The vulnerability exists due to the driver directly dereferencing a user-controlled pointer as a function pointer.",
        "This vulnerability can lead to a local privilege escalation from a normal user to system-level access.",
         "The provided code snippets show examples of how the vulnerability can be exploited.",
         "The vulnerability exists in versions of the Novell client up to and including Novell Client 2 SP3 for Windows (IR1a) and Novell Client 2 SP2 (IR6) for Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008"
