Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3894:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly parsing the CMAP table when rendering specially crafted TrueType fonts (TTF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper parsing of the CMAP table in TrueType fonts.
- Failure to handle specially crafted TTF files correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution in kernel mode.
- Attackers can gain complete control of an affected system.
- Ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker convinces a user to visit a malicious website containing a specially crafted embedded font.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the embedded font is parsed and displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker needs to host a malicious website or compromise an existing site to deliver the crafted TTF.
- No direct user interaction other than visiting the malicious site is required for exploitation.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The CMAP table defines how character codes are mapped to glyph index values within a font.
- A malformed CMAP table is the key to triggering the vulnerability.
