Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the Windows TCP/IP driver improperly handling packets during TCP connection. Specifically, it's an integer overflow issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow in the Windows TCP/IP driver. This improper handling leads to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could cause the target system to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through sending specially crafted packets to the server. These packets exploit the improper handling of TCP connections in the TCP/IP driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to send network packets to the vulnerable system. They must be able to craft specific TCP packets designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker may be external to the network, but firewalls and network best practices can mitigate this by limiting exposed ports.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT and as "Moderate" for Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows TCP/IP driver handles specially crafted packets.
- There is no indication that the vulnerability had been publicly disclosed or exploited prior to the release of the security update.
- Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity, and provides methods for automatic updating.
- Microsoft's Exploitability Index rated the likelihood of exploitation, and for this vulnerability it is addressed as part of the June 2013 bulletin.
