Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3070:

**Verification:**
The content from `kb.netgear.com` directly mentions CVE-2013-3070 in the context of a firmware update for the WNDR3700v4 router, stating: "[CVE-2013-3070] Security-Information Disclosure: Unauthenticated attackers can make a request to the management web interface to disclose the PSK of the wireless LAN." This aligns with the general description of information disclosure vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the router's management web interface failing to properly restrict access to sensitive information. Specifically, the PSK (Pre-Shared Key) of the wireless LAN can be disclosed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure: The primary weakness is the exposure of the wireless LAN's PSK to unauthorized parties.
- Lack of authentication/authorization: Unauthenticated requests to the web interface can trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the disclosure of the wireless network's PSK.
- An attacker with the PSK can gain unauthorized access to the wireless network, potentially intercepting traffic, injecting malicious content, and compromising devices on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a request to the router's management web interface.
- The request can be made over the network without prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on a network that can reach the router's web management interface.
- No prior authentication or access to the router is required.

**Additional Notes**
