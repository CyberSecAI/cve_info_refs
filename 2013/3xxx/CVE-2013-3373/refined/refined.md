Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   MIME header injection in outgoing emails generated by RT (Request Tracker).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Insufficient sanitization or validation of values interpolated into email headers, specifically allowing newlines.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A malicious user could inject arbitrary MIME headers into outgoing emails.
*   This could lead to various attacks like:
    *   Email spoofing
    *   Spam injection
    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Potentially other email client-specific exploits if the injected headers cause misinterpretation or parsing flaws in the email client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through RT's email templates, specifically those used to generate outgoing emails.
*   A malicious user could inject newlines into values used in headers of emails generated by RT. These newlines could then be used to inject additional malicious headers.
*   Custom email templates are also vulnerable if not properly coded to prevent newlines in header values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to influence the content used in RT's email templates. This could occur by:
    *   Having access to modify templates directly (administrative access).
    *   Being able to inject user-controlled data (e.g. ticket information) into the email content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in RT 3.8.0 and above.
*   The provided information states that the stock templates were fixed by the patchset, but custom templates must be updated to ensure that values interpolated into mail headers do not contain newlines.
*   This content provides more detail than the typical CVE description, specifically outlining the injection point as being within email headers using the newline character.
