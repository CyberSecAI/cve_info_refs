### Security Bulletin

## Summary

TADDM security improvement deployed started from TADDM 7.2.1.5 and in TADDM 7.2.2 avoids vulnerability in embedded TADDM BIRT-Report Viewer application.

## Vulnerability Details

## Affected Products and Versions

TADDM 7.1.2, 7.2.0.0 through 7.2.1.4 (later TADDM releases contain parameter that allow to disable BIRT-Report)

## Remediation/Fixes
