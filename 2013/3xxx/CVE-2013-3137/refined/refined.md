Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Microsoft FrontPage improperly parsing the Document Type Definition (DTD) of an XML file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness lies in FrontPage's incorrect handling of DTD entities within XML files. This allows for information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could lead to the disclosure of the contents of a local file on the target system. An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored on the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Email Attachment:** An attacker could send a specially crafted FrontPage document as an email attachment. The user must be convinced to open the malicious attachment for the attack to succeed.
-   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a website containing a malicious webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to trick users into visiting the compromised site and opening a crafted FrontPage file. This could be done by convincing users to click on a malicious link via email or Instant Messenger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to create a specially crafted FrontPage document that exploits the improper DTD parsing.
-   The attacker must then convince the target user to open this malicious document, either through email or by luring the user to a malicious webpage.
- The attacker would not be able to force users to visit these websites, but would have to convince them, typically by a link in an email or messenger.

**Additional Details:**
-   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" with "Information Disclosure" as the maximum security impact.
-   The vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly disclosed before the security update was released.
-   Microsoft is unaware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the security update release.
-  The fix ensures that FrontPage correctly handles DTD entities.
