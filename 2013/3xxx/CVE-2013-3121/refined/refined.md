Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-3121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is the improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer. This can lead to memory corruption, which is then exploitable by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** Attackers can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They then need to convince a user to visit this malicious site.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers may also leverage compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content to host the malicious code.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers can use phishing techniques, such as emails or instant messages, to trick users into visiting the malicious site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs a platform to host the malicious website or inject malicious code into existing websites.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to convince users to interact with the malicious content (e.g., click a link, open an attachment).
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without requiring physical access to the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems, highlighting the severe risk, especially for end-users who frequently use web browsers.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security update by Microsoft, and there was no indication of exploitation in the wild at the time of the bulletin release.
*   The provided document highlights a mitigation measure of using Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers. This reduces the risk by restricting the ability of a user or administrator to download and execute malicious web content.
*   The document provides workarounds by setting security zones to high to block ActiveX controls and scripting.
