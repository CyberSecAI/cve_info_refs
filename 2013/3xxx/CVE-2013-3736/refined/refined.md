- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application which would be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited through the manipulation of attachment filenames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to upload a file with a crafted filename to the RT system. The document states that the vector is difficult to exploit due to parsing requirements.
