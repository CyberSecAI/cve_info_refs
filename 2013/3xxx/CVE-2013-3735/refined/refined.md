{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The PHP parser (`zendparse`) could return a value of 2, not just 1, to indicate a parsing error. This was not being properly checked in the `compile_file` and `compile_string` functions, leading to a potential segfault.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect error handling",
      "Missing check for specific return values"
    ],
    "impact": "A segfault could occur if the parser returned a value of 2 which was not accounted for, leading to potential denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploiting a malformed PHP script that triggers a parsing error, resulting in the parser returning 2 instead of 1, could trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to supply a malformed PHP script to a vulnerable PHP application."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content includes the fix for the vulnerability, which was to check for `compiler_result != 0` instead of `compiler_result == 1`. This fix handles all non-zero return values from the parser, ensuring the segfault doesn't occur.\n\nThe commit message \"fix bug #64660 - yyparse can return 2, not only 1\" and the code changes clearly indicate the issue and the fix."
