{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple buffer overflows existed in dyld's openSharedCacheFile() function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflows",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who has arbitrary code execution on a device may be able to persist code execution across reboots.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to have arbitrary code execution on a device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to execute arbitrary code on the targeted device."
