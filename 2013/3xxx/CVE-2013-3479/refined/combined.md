ShareThis clearly has management problems: no support for the latest WordPress releases, no updates in almost a year, poor rating scores since the downturn. Too bad. The integration with myCRED would be nice but no way I’ll pay for a subscription to broken software.

This plugin used to be excellent but lately I have seen a lot of malware ads popping up on my website by using this plugin. Fake Chrome updates started to appear and replaced the pages users were at on the site. Sneaky redirections, tracking users, displaying fake google chrome update ads.
Just do not USE THIS PLUGIN. You have been warned.

Used to be good. Recent update it is now full of malware. Sending data without user consent or ever even mentioning it. Do not install this plugin unless you want agkn.com pixel, scorecardsearch.com, sharethis.com, owneriq.net, thebrighttag.com, bigsea.weborama.com, doubleclick.net, v12group.com, weborama.fr…

Do not install and definitely don’t activate the ShareThis plugin. Once installed it places trackers on your site that cannot be removed and it leaves the sharing bar on the website even after the plugin appears to have been uninstalled.

It is true that this plugin adds a ton (like over 40) of tracking scripts and other spyware to the site. It will slow the website down even with caching. Besides that, why in the heck have they put all these tracking scripts in and why does Wordpress.org allow trash plugins like this to stay active, because this really wastes our time.
DON’T INSTALL THIS, IT IS A BAD PLUGIN.
Although the buttons are cute, if you don’t look at the code and what’s really happening.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
