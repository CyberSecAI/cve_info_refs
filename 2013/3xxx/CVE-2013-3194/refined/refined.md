Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3194:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer. This memory corruption can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability where Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the context of the current user.
- An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user.
- If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is web-based. An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to visit it.
- Attackers could also leverage compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content (or ads). These could host malicious content that exploits the vulnerability.
-  Attackers could convince users to click on links via email or instant messages or open attachments sent via email that would redirect the user to a malicious webpage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage that can be accessed by a user using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- An attacker needs to be able to convince a user to visit the attacker controlled website.
- The attacker needs to have the capability to craft a website that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Internet Explorer including 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients, and "Moderate" for Windows servers.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be actively exploited at the time this security bulletin was released.
- Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to help mitigate attacks by exploiting this vulnerability.
