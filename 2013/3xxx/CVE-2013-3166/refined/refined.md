Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability is that Internet Explorer does not handle the encoding for Shift_JIS auto-selection correctly. This improper handling allows attackers to potentially bypass security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability. This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. In this specific case, the incorrect encoding handling creates the opportunity for this.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The XSS vulnerability can lead to information disclosure. An attacker can potentially view content from another domain or Internet Explorer zone by exploiting this encoding issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to view content from another domain or Internet Explorer zone that they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Webpage:** An attacker would need to create a malicious webpage specifically designed to trigger this vulnerability in Internet Explorer. This webpage would exploit the incorrect Shift_JIS encoding handling.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit the crafted webpage. This can be done through methods such as:
    *   Embedding the malicious link in an email or instant messenger message.
    *   Compromising legitimate websites and injecting the malicious content there.
    *   Using websites or advertisements that accept user-provided content to host the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Webpage Hosting:** The attacker needs the ability to host a webpage or inject malicious content into existing websites.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to be able to convince the target user to visit the malicious page. No specific user rights on the target system are required as the vulnerability is in the browser itself.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" on client systems and "Low" on servers.
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by blocking cross-domain scrolling events in Internet Explorer.
*   Mitigating factors include using Enhanced Security Configuration (ESC) on Windows Servers.
*   Workarounds involve setting the browser security level to High or disabling/prompting for Active Scripting.
