Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-3368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `bin/rt` script using semi-predictable names when creating temporary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable Tempfile Names:** The `bin/rt` script creates temporary files with names that can be guessed or predicted. This is a common weakness that can be exploited to overwrite files.
- **Insecure Tempfile Handling:**  The script does not properly secure the creation of temp files, making them vulnerable to manipulation by malicious actors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **File Overwriting:** A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite files on the system.
- **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):**  By overwriting system files or files belonging to the user running the `bin/rt` script, an attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** This vulnerability can be exploited by a user who has local access to the system and the ability to execute the `bin/rt` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a user on the system where RT is installed.
- **Execution of bin/rt:** The attacker must have the ability to execute the `bin/rt` script.
- **Knowledge of tempfile naming:** The attacker needs to be able to predict the name of the tempfile that will be created.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects RT versions 3.8.0 and above.
- The advisory mentions that this could "possibly" be exploited, suggesting some difficulty or limited window of opportunity for exploitation.
- Patches for all affected versions of RT were released to address this vulnerability.
