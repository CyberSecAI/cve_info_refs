## CVE-2013-3009

The provided content reveals the following regarding CVE-2013-3009:

*   **Vulnerability:** The root cause of CVE-2013-3009 is related to insecure use of the `invoke` method of `java.lang.reflect.Method` class, which could allow a complete Java security sandbox escape. The weakness was found in `com.ibm.CORBA.iiop.ClientDelegate` class.
*   **Attack Vector**: By exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker could potentially call the `setSecurityManager` method of the `java.lang.System` class.
*   **Impact**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a complete Java security sandbox escape.
*   **Affected Software**: The vulnerability affected multiple versions of IBM Java, ranging from 1.4 to 7.x and IBM products such as IBM Notes / Domino, Websphere, Tivoli and other IBM products incorporating vulnerable IBM JRE.

Also, one of the security explorations reports states that the fix for issue 67 (CVE-2013-3009) was improperly fixed and could be bypassed.

*   The original patch moved the vulnerable `invoke` call and related functionality into a private inner class, but the functionality could still be accessed through a dedicated proxy object.
*   Security checks were not introduced, and the patch solely relied on hiding the vulnerable method.
*   Bypassing the fix only required minor changes to the original Proof of Concept (POC) code.
*   The bypass was tested on IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 7.1 and 8.0 for Linux (32-bit x86) and achieved a complete Java security sandbox escape.
