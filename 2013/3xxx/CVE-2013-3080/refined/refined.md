- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) VAMI web interface allows authenticated remote attackers to upload files to arbitrary locations. This could result in the creation of new files, overwriting existing ones, denial of service, or code execution if certain files are replaced.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the vCSA VAMI web interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary file creation or overwriting of existing files, potentially resulting in denial of service or remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated remote attacker with access to the vCSA VAMI web interface can upload files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the vCSA VAMI web interface. The default vCSA setup only has a root user defined for authentication.
