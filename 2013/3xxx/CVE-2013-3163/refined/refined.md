Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. Specifically, it is triggered by improper access of an object in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability: A flaw that allows a crafted input to corrupt memory in a way that can be controlled by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker hosts a specially crafted webpage.
- Drive-by downloads: The attacker convinces a user to visit the malicious page.
- Compromised websites: Malicious code can be injected into websites that accept user-provided content.
- Phishing: Email messages or instant messenger links can direct a user to the malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted webpage that exploits the memory corruption vulnerability.
- The attacker needs a way to lure the victim into visiting this webpage, such as through social engineering tactics.
- The attacker has to rely on the victim using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) across different Windows operating systems.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client versions of Windows and "Moderate" for server versions, reflecting the higher risk on end-user systems.
- Microsoft was aware of targeted attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer 8.
- The vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly disclosed before the patch.
- Applying the security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The update includes other defense-in-depth changes to improve security features in Internet Explorer.
