Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3125:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer, specifically due to the browser improperly accessing objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- This allows for arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user of Internet Explorer.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** Attackers can host a specially crafted website that, when viewed in Internet Explorer, triggers the memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised legitimate websites or websites accepting user-generated content, which would then exploit the vulnerability in visitors' browsers.
- **Email or Instant Messenger Links/Attachments:** Attackers could send malicious links or attachments that redirect users to attacker-controlled websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or control a website containing the malicious exploit.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the attacker-controlled website. This can be achieved through social engineering tactics, such as:
    - Phishing emails or instant messages with malicious links.
    - Compromising legitimate websites.
    - Embedding malicious advertisements.
    - Convincing a user to open a malicious attachment sent through email.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems, depending on the operating system and version of Internet Explorer.
*   Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server operating systems provides some mitigation.
*   The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate attacks by making it more difficult to exploit vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer
*   Microsoft had not received reports of this vulnerability being actively exploited at the time this security bulletin was released.
