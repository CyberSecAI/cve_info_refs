* Or pass in the variables to the URL: `http://yoursite.com/?v_sortby=views&v_orderby=desc`
* You can replace DESC with ASC if you want the least viewed posts.

### To Display Updating View Count With LiteSpeed Cache

Use: `<div id="postviews_lscwp"></div>` to replace `<?php if(function_exists('the_views')) { the_views(); } ?>`.

NOTE: The id can be changed, but the div id and the ajax function must match.

Replace the ajax query in `wp-content/plugins/wp-postviews/postviews-cache.js` with

```
jQuery.ajax({
    type:"GET",
    url:viewsCacheL10n.admin_ajax_url,
    data:"postviews_id="+viewsCacheL10n.post_id+"&action=postviews",
    cache:!1,
    success:function(data) {
        if(data) {
            jQuery('#postviews_lscwp').html(data+' views');
        }
   }
});

```

Purge the cache to use the updated pages.

### To Get Views With REST API

You can obtain the number of post views by adding `views` to your `_fields` parameter:

/wp/v2/posts?\_fields=views,title

Have been using this a while along side Advanced Queries and Elementors Loop widget to display a list grid of most popular articles on a website.
Doesnt seem to be working anymore. I think its still keeping count of the post views, but the views template variable isnt pulling in the correct posts. From the posts it is showing it looked like it stopped updating in January of this year.
Will need to find another solution!

Very nice plugin, but I still have an advice that the view counter data should be saved in a new table. Now it was saved in “wp\_postmeta”. Maybe it can be improved. Never mind, just my idea.
Thanks!
