Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-3859:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to how Microsoft Office Pinyin IME (Chinese) exposes configuration options that are not designed to run on the secure desktop. This allows a low-privilege user to elevate their access privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** A low-privilege user can gain higher level system privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can run arbitrary code with system-level privileges (kernel mode).
- **Full System Control:**  An attacker could gain complete control of the system, enabling them to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access Required:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the target system.
- **Exploitation via IME Toolbar:** The attacker uses the Microsoft Pinyin IME toolbar to launch Internet Explorer with system-level privileges.
- **Abuse of Elevated Privileges:** Once Internet Explorer is running with elevated privileges, the attacker can execute other programs with the same level of privilege.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account with the ability to log on to the target system locally.
- **Microsoft Pinyin IME 2010:** The target system must have Microsoft Pinyin IME 2010 installed, which is included with Chinese versions of Microsoft Office 2010 by default, or as an optional component in other language versions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability only affects Microsoft Pinyin IME 2010. Other versions of Simplified Chinese IME and other IME implementations are not affected.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Microsoft Office IME (Chinese) exposes configuration options not designed to run on the secure desktop.
- Microsoft recommends installing this update, even on systems with non-vulnerable IMEs, to maintain consistency for shared files across Office products.
- No workarounds were identified, therefore applying the provided update is critical for remediation.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin, and there were no reports of exploitation in the wild at the time of the bulletin release.
