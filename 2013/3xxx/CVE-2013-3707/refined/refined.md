Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3707:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content from www.novell.com_ce410657_20250125_231439.html directly references CVE-2013-3707 and describes a vulnerability in the Novell Remote Manager (NRM) process in Open Enterprise Server (OES). Therefore this content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the HTTPSTK service, which listens on port 8009. It fails to properly close connections after a basic TCP handshake. The SSL socket was being treated like a socket which resulted in missing `SSL_free` and `SSL_shutdown` calls upon error.
*   **Weakness:** The core issue is a resource management problem related to how the HTTPSTK service handles SSL connections and the lack of proper cleanup when errors occur. This leads to a buildup of `CLOSE_WAIT` connections.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** The buildup of `CLOSE_WAIT` connections can lead to several issues:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Legitimate users are blocked from accessing the service.
    *   **Service Crash:** The service eventually crashes due to the accumulation of connections.
    *   **Unauthenticated Exploit:** The exploit does not require authentication, making it easily exploitable.
    *   **Key Service Disruption:** The vulnerability affects a key service of the Novell server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through network connections to port 8009. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending TCP handshake requests to this port.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target server.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any authentication credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**3. Additional Information:**
*   **Discovered and Reported By:** "swappiness0"
*   **Resolution**: The content mentions a tentative fix in `novell-nrm-2.0.2-297.305.302.3` rpm package but mentions it was still being tested/investigated.

**4. Summary**
The content provides specific technical details that explain the root cause and impact of CVE-2013-3707 beyond a simple vulnerability description. The key weakness is the incorrect handling of SSL connections leading to a denial of service and eventual service crash. An unauthenticated attacker can trigger this by sending TCP requests to the service's port.
