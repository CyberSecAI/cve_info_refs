Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-3742:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper HTML escaping of the SQL query in the error message displayed when creating a view in phpMyAdmin. Specifically, the `$sql_query` variable, which contains the user-provided SQL query, is not escaped before being included in the error message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS. By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the view's name or SQL query, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of the victim's browser when the error message is displayed.
- **Insufficient Output Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape the user-supplied input before incorporating it into the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, modify page content, or perform other client-side attacks.
- **Account compromise:** If the attacker manages to steal session cookies, they can potentially compromise the user's phpMyAdmin account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted View Name/SQL Query:** An attacker crafts a malicious SQL query or view name containing malicious JavaScript code.
- **View Creation Error:**  The attacker initiates the view creation process, intentionally triggering an error. This error displays the unescaped query, leading to the execution of the attacker's injected JavaScript code within the error message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of phpMyAdmin. The security advisory mentions that the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the necessary form.
- **Ability to create views:** The attacker needs sufficient permissions to create views in the database managed by phpMyAdmin.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub commit ([9b3551601ce714adb5e3f428476052f0ec6093bf](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/9b3551601ce714adb5e3f428476052f0ec6093bf)) addresses the issue by applying HTML escaping using `htmlspecialchars()` to the SQL query within the error message.
- The vulnerability is considered non-critical due to the requirement of being a logged-in user, which limits the scope of potential attackers.
- The affected versions are phpMyAdmin 4.0.x. Upgrading to version 4.0.3 or applying the patch resolves the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is also associated with CWE-661 (Incorrect Behavior Order) and CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
