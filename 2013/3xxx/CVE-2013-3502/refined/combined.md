# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

## GroundWork Monitor Enterprise contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#345260

Original Release Date: 2013-03-08 | Last Revised: 2013-03-08

---

### Overview

GroundWork Monitor Enterprise 6.7.0 and possibly earlier versions contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| The [SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory](https://www.sec-consult.com/en/Vulnerability-Lab/Advisories.htm) states:  *The following vulnerability description has been categorized into the components where the vulnerabilities have been identified.**1) Insufficient authentication in many components: Many components of GroundWork are only "secured" by Referer-header checks. An attacker who uses a specific, known Referer-header of the GroundWork Apache configuration file is able to access parts of the administration interface without prior authentication. Only few components are additionally secured by the JOSSO Single-Sign-On system.**2) Foundation webapp admin interface:**2.1) Referer-check: The webapp is only "secured" by a referer check, an unauthenticated attacker is able to access the admin interface. The attacker also has write access and is able to manipulate settings as admin user and he can further exploit other vulnerabilities.**2.2) Unauthenticated file disclosure & file write/modification An unauthenticated attacker is able to read arbitrary files of the operating system with the access rights of the operating system user "nagios" (the only "security protection" is the weak Referer-check from 2.1).**2.3) Multiple permanent XSS vulnerabilities An unauthenticated attacker is able to store malicious JavaScript/HTML code in many places within the admin interface and hence further attack / take over admin users of GroundWork! If an administrator e.g. clicks on the "Administration" /"Foundation" menu within GroundWork, the JavaScript code will be executed automatically.**3) MONARCH component:* *3.1) Direct OS command injection An attacker with a valid cookie (JOSSO SSO) with at least low-privileged "user" access rights is able to execute arbitary operating system commands. He is able to gain access to sensitive configuration files, e.g. passwords of Nagios (and hence of many services within the monitored network) in cleartext.**3.2) XML external entity injection & arbitrary XML file (over-)write The Monarch components suffer from XXE attacks where an attacker e.g. is able to read arbitrary files of the operating system (sensitive configuration files, etc.).**The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a malicious XML file within the "Profile Importer" component and then view this uploaded file within the same module.**4) Nagios-App component**4.1) Access to sensitive files, A low privileged user is able to gain access to log files or nagios configuration files (e.g. clear text passwords) just by entering the corresponding URL and including the Referer-header from 1).**5) Performance component**5.1) Write files & execute operating system commands An unauthenticated attacker is able to write files (filename & path can be chosen arbitrarily) with pre-given XML content with the access rights of the "nagios" operating system user. The XML content is partially given by the application, but can be modified by the attacker for further injection attacks. In the end it is possible to execute operating system commands, e.g. by using SSI (server-side includes) injection.* Note there are additional vulnerabilities. For detailed vulnerability information regarding the above listed vulnerabilities and additional vulnerabilities see [SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory 1](https://www.sec-consult.com/fxdata/seccons/prod/temedia/advisories_txt/20130308-0_GroundWork_Monitoring_Multiple_critical_vulnerabilities_wo_poc_v10.txt) and [SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory 2](https://www.sec-consult.com/fxdata/seccons/prod/temedia/advisories_txt/20130308-1_GroundWork_Monitoring_Multiple_high_risk_vulnerabilities_part2_wo_poc_v10.txt). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to modify the administrator web interface of the system, read sensitive configuration files, or execute arbitrary operating system commands with the permission's of the GroundWork Monitor Enterprise system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Change configuration** GroundWork has released a [technical bulletin](https://kb.groundworkopensource.com/display/SUPPORT/SA6.7.0-1%2BSome%2Bweb%2Bcomponents%2Ballow%2Bbypass%2Bof%2Brole%2Baccess%2Bcontrols) addressing some of the vulnerabilities. Users are advised to read GroundWork's technical bulletin and apply the recommended changes. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent SQLi, unauthenticated file uploads, or denial of service attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing a web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
