- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a remote code vulnerability where an authenticated attacker with access to the Virtual Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) may run an existing file as root.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Arbitrary file execution vulnerability in vCSA.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to VAMI can execute arbitrary files as root on the vCSA.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access to the VAMI interface is required, along with valid authentication credentials. In default vCSA setup, the only user is root.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated access to the VAMI web interface.
