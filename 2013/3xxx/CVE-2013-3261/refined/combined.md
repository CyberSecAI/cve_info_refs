### [No! It’s just a buggy “Pay please”-Plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-its-just-a-buggy-pay-please-plugin/)

[Michael Ritsch](https://profiles.wordpress.org/michaelritsch/ "Posts by Michael Ritsch")
October 12, 2021

The free version is a useless “pay please” plugin…. you are limited to 3 gallerys…. they want you to pay if you want to use it on a normal way. I decided to telete it instant – but the plugin is so buggy that you are not able to delete it. Just an error appears.
i’m not able to uninstall that plugin without an ftp connection.

### [Great! -but maybe easily affected?..](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/other-plugins-are-killing-this-one/)

This plugin in itself are excellent. Beautiful galleries and easy to use albums.
I’ve experienced though that other plugins -or themes -too easily mess with functions in this plugin. But who am I to actually know who / what to blame ;)..
4 stars for a lovely plugin -1 for maybe more updates? and maybe not so easily affected by other plugins etc..

This is the only gallery plugin that allowed me to customise it as per my needs. Most are looking fancy but they are somehow limited in customisation. This one has it all(almost). Thank you.

I’ve installed following the instructions and the gallery doesn’t work.
Creating a Gallery creates a folder but not showing in the list.

### [N° 1 PHOTOGALLERY](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/n-1-gallery-for-wordpress/)

You can download and try every other existing photo gallery (paid and free ones) in the whole wordpress repository, but you won’t find another system complete and reliable like this one. FLAGALLERY WORKS perfectly with ELEMENTOR and every other page builder you can think of. You can use a ton of different “SKIN” to meet any design need. The authors keep updating and improving the plugin on regular frequent basis. FAST AND RELIABLE, RESPONSIVE WITH A PIXEL PERFECT DESIGN. The Galleries / Albums / Upload management system is just WONDERFUL. Believe me, don’t search further, the photogallery system you’ve always dreamed about is HERE.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
