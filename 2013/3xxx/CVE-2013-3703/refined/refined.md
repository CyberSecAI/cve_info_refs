{
  "cve": "CVE-2013-3703",
  "description": "The web UI controller of the API in openSUSE Build Service (OBS) allows adding or removing user roles from packages or project metadata without write permission checks. Versions before are not affected.",
  "affected_versions": "OBS git master and 2.4 branch (including 2.4.3)",
  "root_cause": "Missing write permission checks in the web UI controller when adding or removing user roles from packages or project metadata.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Inadequate authorization",
    "Missing permission checks"
  ],
  "impact": "Users can modify package or project metadata, including user roles, without the necessary permissions, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modifications.",
    "attack_vectors": [
    "Web UI interface",
    "API endpoint"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user of the openSUSE Build Service, not necessarily with administrative privileges, but with access to the vulnerable API endpoint. User authentication is required to use the vulnerable function, but no specific roles or privileges beyond having an account is needed.",
  "patch": "The vulnerability was fixed by implementing permission checks in the package and project models. Specifically, the `check_write_access!` method was introduced and called before allowing modifications to the packages or projects, which was released as OBS 2.4.4.",
  "additional_info": "The vulnerability was present in the OBS git master and 2.4 branches (including 2.4.3), and was not present in prior versions."
