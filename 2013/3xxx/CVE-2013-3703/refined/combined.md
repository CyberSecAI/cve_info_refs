| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=828256#c0)  Adrian Schröter   2013-07-05 07:05:27 UTC  ``` The webui controller of the api provides an interface to add or remove user roles from packages or project meta data. This is done without any write permission checks in current git master and OBS 2.4 branch (including 2.4.3). Versions before are not affected.  Our productive instances have been hotfixed for now.  Security team, please decide if we want to create a CVE or anything elase for this and re-assign the bug back to me. thanks. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=828256#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2013-07-05 09:43:21 UTC  ``` I have assigned CVE-2013-3703.  Use it in announcements please.   (DO we need to update anything on our products?) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=828256#c2)  Adrian Schröter   2013-07-05 10:09:23 UTC  ``` thanks, no product updates needed. I will just release an OBS 2.4.4 with that fix. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=828256#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2013-07-05 22:00:17 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=828256#c4)  Adrian Schröter   2013-07-08 17:31:00 UTC  ``` 2.4.4 containing a fix is released. ``` |  |
