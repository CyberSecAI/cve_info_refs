# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-084 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint Server Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2885089)

Published: October 08, 2013 | Updated: November 06, 2013

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office server software. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Office file in an affected version of Microsoft SharePoint Server, Microsoft Office Services, or Web Apps.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, Microsoft SharePoint Services 3.0, and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010. This security update is also rated Important for affected Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps on supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, and Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how affected Microsoft software validates data when parsing specially crafted Office files, and by changing configuration of SharePoint pages to help provide additional protection against clickjacking attacks. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**CVE-2013-3889** **is described in multiple security bulletins. How are these bulletins related?**

The Microsoft Excel Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2013-3889) affects the following products:

* Microsoft Excel (MS13-085)
* Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps (MS13-084)

You need to install only the updates that correspond to the software you have installed on your system. If you need to install more than one of these updates, they can be installed in any sequence.

**MS13-086addresses vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft Word and MS13-084addresses a vulnerability affecting Word Automation Services on SharePoint Server. Are the security updates in the two bulletins related?**

No. The two security bulletins address different vulnerabilities and their security updates are not related. Customers should apply the updates for the software installed on their systems.

**What updates apply to Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007** **and** **Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0?**

The 2596741 update applies to both of the following:

* Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007
* Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (standalone installations)

Since it is the same 2596741 update for both products, customers only need to apply the update once to be protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

In addition, for supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, the following updates apply only to the specific components:

* Excel Services (2827327)

**What updates apply to Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010?**

The 2589365 update applies to both of the following:

* Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010
* Microsoft Windows SharePoint Foundation 2010 (standalone installations)

Since it is the same 2589365 update for both products, customers only need to apply the update once to be protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

In addition, for supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, the following updates apply only to the specific components:

* Excel Services (2826029)
* Word Automation Services (2826022)
* Microsoft Web Applications 2010 (2826030)
* Microsoft Excel Web App 2010 (2826028)

**What updates apply to Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013?**

**What update applies** **to Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013?**

The following update applies only to the specific component or standalone product:

* Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013 (2827222)

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin, this update includes defense-in-depth updates to help improve security-related features in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010.

**What is defense-in-depth?**

In information security, defense-in-depth refers to an approach in which multiple layers of defense are in place to help prevent attackers from compromising the security of a network or system.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## Microsoft Excel Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3889

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps parse content in specially crafted files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3889](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3889).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources**

  Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when affected versions of Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps do not properly handle objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run in the security context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Office file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel software.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office file to the user and then convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Excel is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that affected Microsoft software validates data when parsing specially crafted Office files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Parameter Injection Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3895

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft SharePoint Server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3895](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3895).

#### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when SharePoint Server does not properly protect against a practice known as clickjacking in a SharePoint page.

**What is** **clickjacking?**

Clickjacking is an online threat whereby an attacker's webpage deceives a user into clicking malicious content by disguising it as legitimate content. For example, a legitimate webpage might be hidden as a "frame" inside a malicious page. When a user clicks in the malicious page, the user is actually clicking something else: such as taking actions on a target SharePoint site on behalf of the user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the victim.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An unauthenticated attacker could create a specially crafted page and then convince an authenticated SharePoint user to visit the page.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems that are running an affected version of SharePoint Server are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by changing the configuration of SharePoint pages to help provide additional protection against clickjacking attacks.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

### Update Information

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Management Server (SMS), and System Center Configuration Manager help administrators distribute security updates.
* The Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit aid in streamlining the testing and validation of Windows updates against installed applications.

For more information about these tools and guidance in deploying security updates across networks, see [Security Tools for IT Pros](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc297183).

**Note for SharePoint Server** The detection tools (such as Microsoft Update, WSUS, MBSA, SMS, and System Center Configuration Manager) are applicable for single-server Microsoft SharePoint Server deployments. The detection tools do not detect the applicability of the updates on systems configured as part of a multiple-system SharePoint server farm.
