Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-3887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows Ancillary Function Driver (AFD) improperly handling data copying between kernel and user memory. Specifically, the driver allows excessive data to be copied from kernel memory to user memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is that the improper data handling allows a local user to potentially access sensitive information residing in kernel memory, which should be protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from kernel memory.
- This information could be used by an attacker to further compromise the affected system.
- Note that this vulnerability does not allow for direct code execution or privilege escalation but can aid further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local access:** An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system.
- **Specially crafted application:** The attacker must run a specially crafted application on the system that is specifically designed to exploit this vulnerability and extract kernel memory data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user on the target system with valid credentials.
- The attacker must be able to execute programs on the system.
- The attacker requires the knowledge to craft a specific application that exploits the memory copying issue.

**Additional details from the documents:**
- The vulnerability affects 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012.
- The vulnerability is present in the `afd.sys` driver, which manages Winsock TCP/IP communication.
- The update fixes the vulnerability by correcting the data copying process between kernel and user memory.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security update was released.
- There were no reports of exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the security bulletin's release.
- The Exploitability Index rating for this vulnerability is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the description it could be rated as "2 - Exploitation less likely" because while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code and it was not being actively exploited at the time.
