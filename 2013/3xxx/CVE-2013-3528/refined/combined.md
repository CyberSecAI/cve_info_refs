Even though Vanilla 2.1 is just around the corner we are still supporting 2.0.18.\* installations. To this end we've released an important security update that should be applied immediately to anyone running 2.0.18.\*. The new version can be found [here](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/vanilla-core-2.0.18.8).

If you don't wan't to overwrite every single file then the one file that needs to be changed is [here](https://github.com/vanillaforums/Garden/blob/2.0.18/library/database/class.sqldriver.php) (raw download [here](https://raw.github.com/vanillaforums/Garden/2.0.18/library/database/class.sqldriver.php)).

This is an important security update so please update your installation.

  [@Todd](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Todd) are the links to the single file and raw downloads correct. The date of the revisions shows it to be two years old or I am missing a concept.

  I may not provide the completed solution you might desire, but I do try to provide honest suggestions to help you solve your issue.

  FYI [@Todd](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Todd) - these links appear to be broken

  it looks like what x00 posted is indeed the change needed for just a single file.

  One can also just download the 2.018.8 package and only take that file to switch it out right?

  I would really love the option to update just the files that have changed between versions. anyone knows a simple trick or can you Vanillas provide a repo with just those changed?

  Why? I guess a lot of people who had to code into the core to make language modifications that were not covered by the locale (quite a lot sind 2.0.X) could upgrade way easier that way.

  I now use a comparison tool, but that is also not the most easiest to make those files out.

  [@phreak](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/phreak) just replace the **class.sqldriver.php** , download the whole package then ftp to overwrite the file into

  forum/library/database

  Nothing broke when I did that so it should be fine did it to several other installations.

  you can download the package here <http://vanillaforums.org/addon/vanilla-core>

  if you don't want to overwrite everything then only replace that file.

  Hi, I am running 2.0.18.4. What are the upgrade procedures from 2.0.18.4 to 2.0.18.8 (apart from backing up ![:)](https://open.vanillaforums.com/plugins/emojiextender/emoji/little/smile.png ":)") )?

  I ask because here, <http://vanillaforums.org/addon/vanilla-core> , I can see that 2.0.18.7 has also been released . Should I install 2.0.18.7 first and then 2.0.18.8? Or will the 2.0.18.8 package take care of everything?

  You could look here to see which files have been changed and copy the new versions manually: <https://github.com/vanillaforums/Garden/commits/2.0>

  [@phreak](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/phreak) I think this is what you were looking for as well.

  Backup everything. Overwrite your 2.0.18.4 files with the ones from 2.0.18.8 You don't need to install 2.0.18.7

  There was an error rendering this rich post.

  Git is exactly for this kind of thing. You fork our repo and make your changes and then merge when we do a release.

  So no one has a changelog for 2.0.18.7? I could go through the GitHub commit log but something more readable would be nice...

  By the way, the ".gitignore" file is being included in the releases

  [@Subjunk](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Subjunk), I added the log to the original post.

  Wrt the .gitignore, I'm just doing the release via git archive which is a bit nicer imo. The .gitignore is just a small side-effect of that.

  Thanks for the quick response. For my own education can you point out which change addresses this problem?

  I think there is still a major security flaw in 2.0.18.8.

  I always have kept my forum in approval mode. I manually approve every new member. Like many, I had problems with bots spamming the application form, but none of them got through to become members.

  About a month ago, the application spam was significantly reduced. I figured the bots gave up. Apparently they didn't. They just found a way to bypass the application and become members. I went through and deleted all the bad users. There were only 100 or so, so I used SQL to delete them and their content.

  My forum is fully upgraded, so there is definitely still something fishy going on. Also, it would be nice if there was a user interface that allowed deleting users in bulk, so it's easier to recover from those cases where spam does get through. Trying to do it by hand one at a time in the Dashboard was awful having to go through those extra confirmation pages.

  I have entirely disabled new applicants to my forum until this issues is resolved.
