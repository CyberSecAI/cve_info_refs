Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3640:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the "Instant Web Publishing" function of FileMaker Pro. Specifically, when this feature is enabled, it allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding within the "Instant Web Publishing" functionality, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. User-supplied input is not neutralized before being rendered in a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of a user's web browser. This could potentially lead to:
   - Data theft (session hijacking, stealing cookies or credentials)
   - Website defacement
   - Redirecting users to malicious sites
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves leveraging the "Instant Web Publishing" feature of FileMaker Pro. An attacker would need to inject malicious scripts through input fields or parameters handled by the web publishing functionality. The specific method of injecting the malicious script is not explicitly detailed in this document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious script via web publishing functionality when it's enabled.
  - The attacker is likely to use a specially crafted URL/request or input fields which are processed by the application and displayed on the web page.
  - The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability as it states "anonymous or no authentication".
  - The user needs to be convinced to take a standard action that does not feel harmful (such as clicking a link or viewing a file).

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was not addressed in FileMaker Pro 12 and FileMaker Pro Advanced 12, and was only resolved in versions 13.
*   The JPCERT/CC analysis indicates that the attack can be done over the internet using packets and some expertise or luck may be required.

*   The vulnerability is also referenced by the identifier JVNDB-2013-000049
