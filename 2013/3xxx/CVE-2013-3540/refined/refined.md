**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper CSRF protection in the web interface of the affected Airlive cameras.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The web interface of the affected cameras is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited using the GET method.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful CSRF attack allows a malicious user to manipulate web interface parameters. In the provided example, the attacker can create an alternative user with administrator credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL sent by the attacker, targeting the administrator of the camera.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious crafted URL (CSRF vector) to the victim. This can be achieved via social engineering methods, for instance, tricking the admin to click on a malicious link.
