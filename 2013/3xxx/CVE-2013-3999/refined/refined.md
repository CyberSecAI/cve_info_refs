Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-3999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The root cause is a reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Social Media Analytics Version 1.2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means the application takes user-provided input and reflects it back in the response without proper sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Attackers can inject client-side scripts into the IBM Social Media Analytics User Interface. This could lead to:
    *   Data theft or manipulation through malicious script execution in the context of a user's session.
    *   Defacement of the user interface.
    *   Redirection of users to malicious sites.
    *   Other unauthorized actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through manipulating user-provided input that is then reflected in the application's output. This input is likely to be part of a URL parameter, form data, or other user-controllable part of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request that includes the XSS payload.
*   The attacker would need to entice a victim user to click on this specially crafted link, or otherwise cause their browser to send the malicious request to the vulnerable application.
* No specific position or system access is mentioned for the attacker to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specifically in IBM Social Media Analytics 1.2 GA (General Availability) version.
