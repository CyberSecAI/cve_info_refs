**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves injecting a malformed Websocket packet onto the network where Wireshark is capturing traffic or by providing a malicious pcap file to the Wireshark user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to inject network packets or provide malicious pcap files. They do not require any specific privileges to carry out the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Moshe Kaplan.
- The vulnerable versions of Wireshark are 1.8.0 to 1.8.6.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.8.7.
- This vulnerability is identified as wnpa-sec-2013-29 in Wireshark's security advisories.
- The vulnerability has been confirmed to cause a stack overflow.
