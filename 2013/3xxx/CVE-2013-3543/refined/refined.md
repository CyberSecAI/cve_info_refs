The provided content is related to CVE-2013-3543.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insecure methods within the "AxisMediaControlEmb.dll" ActiveX control, specifically the `StartRecord()`, `SaveCurrentImage()`, and `StartRecordMedia()` methods. These methods allow for writing data to arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposed unsafe ActiveX methods
- Arbitrary file overwrite

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker can exploit the insecure ActiveX methods to overwrite arbitrary files with garbage data on a vulnerable system. This could lead to corruption of important files, potentially including system files, and could result in denial of service or other malicious outcomes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTML page that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- User interaction is required to visit the malicious HTML page, which then triggers the vulnerable ActiveX methods.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page or trick a user into visiting a page under their control.
- The attacker must know the class ID of the vulnerable ActiveX control and the methods to call.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the file system on the target machine to overwrite specific files.
