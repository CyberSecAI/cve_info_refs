Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Wave EMBASSY Remote Administration Server (ERAS) Help Desk application fails to properly sanitize user input, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the `ct100$4MainController$TextBoxSearchValue` parameter (search box) is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2013-3577):** Attackers can inject SQL code into the search box, and although the results of the query might not be directly visible, they can infer information based on the server's responses (e.g., timing differences, error messages).
*   **SQL Injection & OS Command Injection (CVE-2013-3578):** A stacked query SQL injection vulnerability in the same parameter allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries and, through that, execute operating system commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially view or modify the contents of the database, including sensitive information.
*   **Server Compromise:** Attackers can gain control of the server by executing operating system commands. This could lead to a complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **Authenticated:** The attacker must be authenticated to the ERAS application, specifically the Help Desk application, which typically requires administrator privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable ERAS application over the network.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials for the ERAS Help Desk application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** While blind SQL injection can be done with limited knowledge, successful stacked query based SQL injection for command execution requires more advanced SQL skills.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The document mentions that strong user permissions can help mitigate the vulnerability, but does not eliminate it.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in ERAS 2.9.5 Service Packs 1 and 2 and later, with users being advised to upgrade.
* The CVSS scores provided apply to CVE-2013-3578, but both vulnerabilities are related.
