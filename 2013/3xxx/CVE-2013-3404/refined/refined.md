- **Data Modification:** The attacker can modify arbitrary information in the database.
- **Credential Reconstruction:** An attacker could use metadata to reconstruct encrypted credentials stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker.
- **Network ports:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the default management ports, TCP ports 8080 or 8443.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM).
- Affected versions are Cisco Unified CM versions 9.1(1a) and prior.
- A Cisco Options Package (COP) file, `cmterm-CSCuh01051-2.cop.sgn`, was released to address the vulnerability.
