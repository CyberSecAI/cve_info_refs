How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     : 670124

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool.  As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead
of backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2+dfsg-1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

We discovered a number of security vulnerabilities which affect both RT
3.8.x and RT 4.0.x.  We are releasing RT versions 3.8.17 and 4.0.13 to
resolve these vulnerabilities, as well as patches which apply atop all
released versions of 3.8 and 4.0.

The vulnerabilities addressed by 3.8.17, 4.0.13, and the below patches
include the following:

RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to a limited privilege escalation
leading to unauthorized modification of ticket data.  The DeleteTicket
right and any custom lifecycle transition rights may be bypassed by any
user with ModifyTicket.  This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2012-4733.

RT 3.8.0 and above include a version of bin/rt that uses
semi-predictable names when creating tempfiles.  This could possibly be
exploited by a malicious user to overwrite files with permissions of the
user running bin/rt.  This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3368.

RT 3.8.0 and above allow calling of arbitrary Mason components (without
control of arguments) for users who can see administration pages.  This
could be used by a malicious user to run private components which may
have negative side-effects.  This vulnerability is assigned
CVE-2013-3369.

RT 3.8.0 and above allow direct requests to private callback components.
Though no callback components ship with RT, this could be used to
exploit an extension or local callback which uses the arguments passed
to it insecurely.  This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3370.

RT 3.8.3 and above are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via
attachment filenames.  The vector is difficult to exploit due to parsing
requirements.  Additionally, RT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to XSS
via maliciously-crafted "URLs" in ticket content when RT's "MakeClicky"
feature is configured.  Although not believed to be exploitable in the
stock configuration, a patch is also included for RTIR 2.6.x to add
bulletproofing.  These vulnerabilities are assigned CVE-2013-3371.

RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to an HTTP header injection limited to
the value of the Content-Disposition header.  Injection of other
arbitrary response headers is not possible.  Some (especially older)
browsers may allow multiple Content-Disposition values which could lead
to XSS.  Newer browsers contain security measures to prevent this.
Thank you to Dominic Hargreaves for reporting this vulnerability.  This
vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3372.

RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to a MIME header injection in outgoing
email generated by RT.  The vectors via RT's stock templates are
resolved by this patchset, but any custom email templates should be
updated to ensure that values interpolated into mail headers do not
contain newlines.  This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3373.

RT 3.8.0 and above are vulnerable to limited session re-use when using
the file-based session store, Apache::Session::File.  RT's default
session configuration only uses Apache::Session::File for Oracle.  RT
instances using Oracle may be locally configured to use the
database-backed Apache::Session::Oracle, in which case sessions are
never re-used.  The extent of session re-use is limited to information
leaks of certain user preferences and caches, such as queue names
available for ticket creation.  Thank you to Jenny Martin for reporting
the problem that lead to discovery of this vulnerability.  This
vulnerability is assigned CVE-2013-3374.

Patches for all releases of 3.8.x and 4.0.x are available for download
below.  Versions of RT older than 3.8.0 are unsupported and do not
receive security patches; please contact [sales at bestpractical.com](http://lists.bestpractical.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rt-announce) if you
need assistance with an older RT version.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
