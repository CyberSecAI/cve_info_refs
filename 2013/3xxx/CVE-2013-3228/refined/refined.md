Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3228:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from multiple sources directly mentions CVE-2013-3228 as an information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's IRDA subsystem. This aligns with the official description for this CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a missing initialization of the `msg_namelen` member within the `irda_recvmsg_dgram()` function when processing a receive message. This function handles datagram reception for the Infrared Data Association (IrDA) protocol.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Information Leak**: The lack of initialization leads to the `net/socket.c` leaking uninitialized kernel stack memory to userland. Specifically, the `sockaddr_storage` variable, which is typically 128 bytes in size. This is because the `msg_namelen` field, which should indicate the length of the provided address, is not properly set. 

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - **Kernel Memory Disclosure:** An unprivileged local user can exploit this flaw by using `recvmsg(2)` or `recvfrom(2)` on an IrDA socket to obtain up to 128 bytes of kernel stack memory. This memory may contain sensitive information, potentially including parts of passwords, cryptographic keys, or other confidential data.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker who has the ability to create and use IrDA sockets.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - **Unprivileged Local User:** An attacker needs to have a user account on the system and the ability to execute code and system calls.
   - **IrDA Socket Interaction**: The attacker needs to be able to create an IrDA socket and invoke the vulnerable recvmsg/recvfrom system call.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content gives additional context regarding other similar vulnerabilities affecting various network protocols within the Linux kernel.
*   The fix involves setting `msg_namelen` to 0 in the `irda_recvmsg_dgram()` function, which prevents the information leak.
*   The vulnerability was present since the introduction of socket address information passing in Linux v1.1.20, highlighting its long-standing presence.

In summary, CVE-2013-3228 represents a local information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's IrDA subsystem, stemming from a missing initialization of the msg_namelen field, which can expose kernel stack memory to unprivileged local users.
