Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3483:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in ERDAS ER Viewer. Specifically, the overflow occurs in the `rf_report_error()` function within the `ermapper_u.dll` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking when copying data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. The `rf_report_error()` function reads a string from a file and copies it byte by byte into a buffer using a loop with a maximum length check, but this check can be bypassed by providing specific input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** Sending a file with a long string of "A" characters causes the application to crash due to the stack buffer overflow.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** While the provided content only details a crash, the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability can be used to achieve remote code execution if carefully crafted input is provided. This would allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted file that, when opened in ERDAS ER Viewer, causes the overflow. This could be done through various methods, such as:
    *   Email attachments.
    *   Links to malicious files.
    *   Compromised web sites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to get a user to open a specially crafted file using the vulnerable version of ERDAS ER Viewer.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `rf_report_error()` function within `ermapper_u.dll`.
*   The vulnerable code snippet:

```assembly
.text:100762D0                 mov     cl, [eax]
.text:100762D2                 mov     [esi+eax], cl
.text:100762D5                 inc     edx
.text:100762D6                 inc     eax
.text:100762D7                 cmp     cl, 0Ah
.text:100762DA                 jz      short loc_100762E8
.text:100762DC                 cmp     edx, 0C7h
.text:100762E2                 jge     short loc_100762E8
.text:100762E4                 cmp     eax, edi
.text:100762E6                 jb      short loc_100762D0
```

*   `eax` appears to be the source pointer and `esi` the destination pointer. The loop copies bytes until a newline character (`0Ah`) is found, the counter `edx` reaches 0xC7, or the source pointer reaches `edi`. However, the `eax` register is incremented without checking if `[eax]` is a valid memory address. If the data exceeds what is expected, the copy will continue beyond the bounds of the destination buffer in memory.
*   The initial report suggests that the vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2013-0726, or a new vector for it, and that the original fix from the vendor was not sufficient.
