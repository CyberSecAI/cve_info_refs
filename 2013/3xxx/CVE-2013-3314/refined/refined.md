Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-3314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is not explicitly stated but the exploit code reveals that the vulnerability lies in the handling of requests to a specific file (`/../etc/RT2870STA.dat`) on Loftek Nexus 543 IP cameras. The path traversal `../` allows access outside of the intended web root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue, which allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended web directory.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The specific file being accessed, `/etc/RT2870STA.dat`, contains sensitive Wi-Fi credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** An attacker can obtain the Wi-Fi credentials, potentially allowing them to gain unauthorized access to the network the camera is connected to, as well as potentially compromise the camera itself.
*  The device is vulnerable to CSRF attacks which allows an attacker to change admin credentials.
*  An attacker can perform a memory dump, which can reveal sensitive information including passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable device.
*   **Path Traversal:** The attacker uses `../` in the URL to traverse the file system to access the file containing the Wi-Fi credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IP camera, i.e., network access to the device.

**Additional Details (from Exploit-DB):**

*   **Specific Device:** The vulnerability is specific to Loftek Nexus 543 IP cameras.
*   **Exploit Availability:** There are proof-of-concept scripts available that can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
*  **CSRF:** The device is vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*  **Memory Dump:** The device allows for retrieval of kernel memory.
