- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation. The `USSDScannerActivity` in TrustGo Antivirus & Mobile Security crashes when an intent is sent to it without any arguments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of input validation in the `USSDScannerActivity` component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious application can send a crafted intent to `USSDScannerActivity`, causing the TrustGo application to crash, effectively disabling its functionality. This leads to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious application installed on the same device can send a specially crafted intent to the vulnerable component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to install an application on the target device.
