{
  "CVE-2013-3186": {
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of process integrity level assignment by Internet Explorer in specific cases.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect process integrity level assignment"
    ],
    "Impact": "Elevation of privileges, allowing arbitrary code to execute with elevated privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Typically used in conjunction with another vulnerability that allows remote code execution. An attacker could first exploit a separate vulnerability to run code within Internet Explorer, then use this vulnerability to elevate the code's integrity level to that of the current user.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to execute code within the context of Internet Explorer at a low integrity level and the ability to trigger the flaw in process integrity level assignment."
