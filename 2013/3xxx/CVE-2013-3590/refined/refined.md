Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a **command injection** vulnerability stemming from the ability to upload and execute arbitrary code (specifically JSP pages) through a vulnerable upload mechanism. This is due to insufficient input validation and improper handling of file types, allowing an attacker to bypass checks by manipulating the Content-Type header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-77 (Command Injection):**  The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious commands through uploaded JSP files.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The upload mechanism at `http://HOSTNAME:8080/searchblox/admin/uploadImage.html` does not properly validate the content of uploaded files, relying solely on the `Content-Type` header which can be easily manipulated.
*   **Lack of File Type Restrictions:** The system does not sufficiently restrict the types of files that can be uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system, with the privileges of the application.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  The ability to execute code can be leveraged for full system compromise. This includes complete control over the server.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** The attacker can overwrite files on the system, potentially leading to data corruption or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Attack:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker uploads malicious JSP code using an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `uploadImage.html` endpoint.
*   **Content-Type Header Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `Content-Type` header to bypass initial checks and upload the malicious JSP file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server to send HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL: `/searchblox/admin/uploadImage.html`.
*   **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Headers:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests and manipulate the `Content-Type` header.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also highlights two other vulnerabilities associated with SearchBlox:
    *   **CVE-2013-3597 (Information Exposure):** The ability to access cleartext credentials.
    *   **CVE-2013-3598 (Path Traversal):** The ability to overwrite arbitrary files through a path traversal vulnerability.
*   The vulnerabilities affect SearchBlox versions 7.4 Build 1 and earlier.
*   The issues were resolved in version 7.5 build 1 or later.
