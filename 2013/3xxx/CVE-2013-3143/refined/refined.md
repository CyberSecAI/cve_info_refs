Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3143:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) error that occurs in the `CMarkup::RemovePointerPos` function within the MSHTML.dll library of Microsoft Internet Explorer. This function is likely related to handling the removal of nodes in the Document Object Model (DOM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free condition. This means that a memory location is freed (deallocated), and then the program attempts to access that memory location again.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can execute arbitrary code within the security context of the user running Internet Explorer. This could allow the attacker to install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As mentioned in the exploit-db entry, the vulnerability can also be triggered to cause a denial of service.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** If the user has administrator privileges, the attacker can gain full control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted web page. An attacker can host a malicious web page and trick a user into visiting it. The malicious page can trigger the use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers may also inject malicious code into legitimate websites or exploit sites that allow user-generated content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host/Inject Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject the specially crafted web page.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious web page. This could be achieved by social engineering, phishing, or watering-hole attacks.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
*   The vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer 9.
*   A specific HTML code example is provided that triggers the vulnerability, involving removing a node and then writing to the document. The provided HTML code uses `document.documentElement.removeNode(true)` along with a `DOMNodeRemoved` event listener.
*   The vulnerability is located within the `CMarkup::RemovePointerPos` function, suggesting it is related to how the browser manages and cleans up memory associated with document elements.
*  Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-055, which was released on July 9, 2013.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was privately reported to the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) program, acquired by ZDI, and then disclosed to Microsoft.
*   The exploit-db entry mentions that ZDI's advisory references an iframe, which is not present in the initial proof-of-concept code provided, suggesting there may be more than one way to trigger this vulnerability.
*  Microsoft's Security Bulletin MS13-055 indicates that a number of memory corruption vulnerabilities were addressed in the update.

In summary, CVE-2013-3143 is a critical use-after-free vulnerability in Internet Explorer 9 that could allow for remote code execution. The vulnerability can be triggered via a specially crafted webpage, and successful exploitation could lead to complete system compromise.
