Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a "multiple fetch" vulnerability in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys), stemming from the driver improperly handling objects in memory. This means the driver accesses the same memory location multiple times without proper validation, creating an opportunity for exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Multiple fetch vulnerability: The driver fetches data from a user-supplied address multiple times without checking if the data changed between fetches. This can lead to inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.
- Improper handling of objects in memory: Specifically, the way the driver accesses and uses objects within memory is flawed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege: A successful exploit allows the attacker to gain elevated privileges, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.
- Read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory: The vulnerability can allow attackers to leak kernel memory.
- Control over the system: With kernel-level access, the attacker could install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights. On Windows 8 and Server 2012, successful exploitation can also lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.
- Malicious application: The attacker would run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the multiple fetch vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid logon credentials
- Local access to the system
- Ability to execute a crafted application

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the `win32k.sys` driver, which is part of the Windows subsystem responsible for window management and graphics.
- The vulnerability is one of several addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-076 and is part of a group of similar issues also identified with CVEs 2013-1341, 2013-1342, 2013-1343, 2013-1344 and 2013-3865.
- The vulnerability was privately reported.
- The vulnerability affects all supported releases of Microsoft Windows up to Windows 8 and Server 2012.
- The fix involves correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

The j00ru.vexillium.org content confirms that the vulnerability was discovered as part of the "Bochspwn" research done by j00ru and Gynvael.
