Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel failing to properly validate memory address values, specifically within the NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) subsystem, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Improper validation of memory address values in the Windows kernel can result in memory corruption.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the kernel.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers can install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights by gaining kernel level access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application that triggers the memory corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
- **Local Logon:** The attacker needs to be able to log on to the target system.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs the ability to execute a specially crafted application.

**Additional Notes:**
- 64-bit versions of Windows are not affected by this specific vulnerability, it's limited to 32-bit versions and some server core installations
- The vulnerability exists within the NTVDM subsystem. Disabling NTVDM can act as a workaround
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2013-3196 and CVE-2013-3198, as they all result from similar memory validation issues within the Windows Kernel. However, the entry points for each are sufficiently different to warrant separate CVEs.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the security update release.
- There were no known reports of active exploitation of this vulnerability when the bulletin was released.
