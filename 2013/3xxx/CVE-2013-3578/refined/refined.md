Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3578:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Wave EMBASSY Remote Administration Server (ERAS) Help Desk application fails to properly filter user input within the `ct100$4MainController$TextBoxSearchValue` parameter or search box. This lack of input sanitization allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (Specifically, Stacked Query SQL Injection):** An attacker can inject malicious SQL commands into the search parameter. This allows for the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.
- **OS Command Injection:** Through the SQL injection, an attacker can execute operating system commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers can execute SQL queries on the server with potentially elevated privileges, which allows them to view or modify the contents of the database.
- **Operating System Command Execution:** Attackers can execute operating system commands on the server, potentially gaining full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed remotely.
- **Application Input:** The vulnerability is triggered through user-controlled input within the ERAS Help Desk application's search box.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated in the ERAS application. This requires a valid privileged administrator account.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in ERAS 2.8.4 and 2.9.5 Help Desk applications.
- The vulnerability is fixed in ERAS 2.9.5 Service Packs 1 and 2.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Simone Cecchini and reported by Thierry Zoller, both from Verizon Enterprise Solutions.
- The CVSS score for CVE-2013-3578 is 6.5 (Base Score) with a vector of AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P, indicating a network-based attack with low complexity, requiring authentication, and resulting in partial confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
