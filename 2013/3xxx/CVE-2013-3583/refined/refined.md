The provided content is related to CVE-2013-3583.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Corporater EPM Suite's `saveProperties.html` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):  The application does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to make unauthorized changes on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can make unauthorized changes to a user's password.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker constructs a malicious webpage that is sent to a previously authenticated user, which, when loaded, sends a forged request to the vulnerable page (`saveProperties.html`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious webpage to a logged-in user of Corporater EPM Suite
- The attacker does not need to be logged in to the application.
