Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-3624:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the insecure storage of sensitive information, specifically credentials, in an unencrypted format on systems deployed using Baramundi Management Suite during OS deployment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312):** Credentials used for OS deployment are stored without encryption on the deployed systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could gain administrative privileges on local machines installed via Baramundi Management Suite due to the exposed credentials.
-   **Active Directory Compromise:**  There's a potential for obtaining administrative privileges in Microsoft Active Directory using the exposed credentials.
-   **Credential Theft:** The stored credentials can be directly accessed from the deployed systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   Direct access to the deployed systems where credentials are stored in clear text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need access to the file system of a system that was deployed using the vulnerable versions of Baramundi Management Suite. The attacker could be a malicious insider, or someone who has already compromised the system through some other means.
