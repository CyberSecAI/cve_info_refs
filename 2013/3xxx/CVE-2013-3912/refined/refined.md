- This can lead to the installation of programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is web-based.
- An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability when accessed through Internet Explorer.
- Attackers could also leverage compromised websites or those that accept user-provided content/advertisements.
