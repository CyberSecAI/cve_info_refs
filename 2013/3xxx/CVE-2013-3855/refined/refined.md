    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted files. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Word does not properly handle objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. System memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Email: sending a specially crafted file to the user and convincing them to open it.",
        "Web-based: hosting a website with a specially crafted Office file or compromising websites to host malicious content."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file using an affected version of Microsoft Office software."
