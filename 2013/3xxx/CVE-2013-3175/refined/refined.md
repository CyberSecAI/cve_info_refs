Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3175:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Windows handles asynchronous Remote Procedure Call (RPC) requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of asynchronous RPC messages, leading to a potential elevation of privilege.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of another user.
- An attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Complete control of the affected system is possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted RPC requests to a shared host.
- Systems that permit RPC traffic from untrusted networks are at a higher risk.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send malformed RPC requests to a vulnerable system.
- The attacker would need network access to a system listening for RPC requests.
- No specific user privileges are mentioned as a pre-requisite for the attacker.
