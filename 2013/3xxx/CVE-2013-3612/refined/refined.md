Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of hard-coded credentials within the Dahua DVR devices. Specifically, all DVRs in the same series ship with the same default root password on a read-only partition, meaning the password cannot be changed without flashing the firmware.
*   Additionally, a separate hard-coded remote backdoor account exists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded root password across a series of devices, along with a hard-coded remote backdoor account.
*  The vulnerability is also linked to a master password derived from a hash of the current date, which can be used to reset the admin password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain privileged access to the DVR device.
*   This can lead to a compromise of the confidentiality and integrity of the device's data.
*   The attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service.
*   Remote control of cameras and other system components.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely due to the hard-coded credentials and the backdoor account.
*   The master password can be used to gain access to the system and reset the admin password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the DVR device.
*   **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker requires knowledge of the hard-coded root password or the backdoor credentials.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vendor disputes this vulnerability, claiming the master password can only be used by local user.
* The vendor has not provided a fix for this vulnerability.

This document provides more detail than a basic CVE description by detailing the specific hardcoded credentials, the existence of a backdoor account, and the use of a master password, in addition to describing the impact and attack vectors.
