Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `vmci_transport_dgram_dequeue()` function in the Linux kernel's VSOCK (Virtual Socket) implementation. When the `skb_recv_datagram()` function fails to receive any data (resulting in `skb->data` being NULL), `vmci_transport_dgram_dequeue()` would return without setting the `msg_namelen` field of the `msghdr` structure, leading to an uninitialized `sockaddr_storage` variable being leaked to user space.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak. The kernel stack memory, specifically an uninitialized `sockaddr_storage` variable, which is 128 bytes, is exposed to user space. This memory can contain sensitive data.
- **Incorrect `msg_namelen` Handling**: The `msg_namelen` field, which should indicate the length of the socket address, is not set to 0 when there is no data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Kernel Stack Exposure:**  An attacker can potentially read sensitive kernel stack memory, which can aid in further attacks or gaining unauthorized information.
- **Information Disclosure:** The leaked information might contain kernel addresses, data structures, or other sensitive data that could compromise system security.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Unprivileged Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an unprivileged user calling the `recvmsg(2)` or `recvfrom(2)` system calls on a VSOCK socket. The user is not required to be root or have elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to create and use VSOCK sockets (virtual socket). This means they could be a local user of the system who can execute programs.
- The attacker does not need to be in a specific network location, nor do they require root privileges to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in the Linux kernel before the fix, and the fix was included in the v3.9-rc7 release.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mathias Krause.
- The fix involved moving the `msg->msg_namelen = 0;` assignment to before the call to `skb_recv_datagram` to avoid using an uninitialized variable.
- The vulnerability was present due to the lack of a check if `skb->data` was null, indicating that no data was received.
