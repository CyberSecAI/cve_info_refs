Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2013-3858 is a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Word. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when Microsoft Word fails to properly handle objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is memory corruption. By providing a specially crafted file, an attacker can corrupt the memory of the application.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The vulnerability arises due to the improper handling of objects in memory when parsing malicious documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
*   **Full System Control:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control over the affected system.
*   **Malicious Activities:** With control over the system, an attacker can install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted File:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Microsoft Word file (e.g., .doc, .dot).
*   **Email:** Attackers can send malicious files to users via email, enticing them to open the file.
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious files on websites. By tricking a user to visit the website and open the file, attackers can exploit the vulnerability. This could also be achieved through compromised or user-content websites hosting the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious File:** The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted Microsoft Word file that triggers the memory corruption.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on user interaction to open the crafted file using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Word.
*   **No Special Network Position Required:** The attack does not require any special network position, other than to be able to send or host a file to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This CVE is related to a cluster of memory corruption vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word. Other CVEs related to the same root cause are CVE-2013-3847, CVE-2013-3848, CVE-2013-3849, and CVE-2013-3857.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Microsoft Office including Office 2003, 2007, 2010 and Microsoft Word Viewer, as well as Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack.
*   The provided document mentions mitigating factors such as users with fewer rights may be less impacted and the vulnerabilities cannot be exploited automatically through email.
*   Workarounds like using Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) or file blocking are recommended. Also avoiding to open untrusted Office files.
