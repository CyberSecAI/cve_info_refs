Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-3712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is that the secret tokens used by SUSE Studio Onsite 1.3 were static as shipped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hardcoded static secret tokens. This means the same secret token was used across all deployments of SUSE Studio Onsite 1.3.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who obtained the static secret token could potentially gain unauthorized access or control over SUSE Studio Onsite 1.3 instances. The specific impact would depend on what actions could be performed with the exposed secret token.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to obtain the static secret token through reverse engineering the software or through some other means (not specified).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to get the static token, and then likely be able to communicate with the affected SUSE Studio Onsite 1.3 instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was part of a larger update to SUSE Studio 1.3.6, which included multiple other bug fixes.
- The update addresses the hardcoded secret tokens, likely through a mechanism to dynamically generate them upon installation.
