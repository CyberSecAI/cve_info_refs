Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3795:

**CVE-2013-3795:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the Data Manipulation Language (DML) component of the MySQL server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The specific weakness isn't detailed, but it lies within the handling of DML operations. The description from the Oracle document implies that some kind of insufficient input validation may be present.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to partial loss of availability or integrity. The attacker may be able to affect or corrupt data or potentially cause denial of service conditions. The CVSS score indicates it is a moderate risk.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the MySQL protocol, meaning an attacker would need to communicate with the MySQL server over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the MySQL server and execute DML statements. This typically means they have some level of access/credentials, though specific credentials requirements are not mentioned in the analyzed documents. The attacker requires an existing valid user session, hence "Single" authentication.

**Summary of relevant information from the provided documents:**

*   **SUSE Security Updates:** The SUSE security updates list CVE-2013-3795 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed by updating MySQL to version 5.5.32/5.5.33. These updates affect various SUSE Linux Enterprise products.
*  **openSUSE Security Updates:** openSUSE updates also address this CVE by updating either mysql or mariadb, these also reference the Oracle CPU.
*   **Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013:** This document lists CVE-2013-3795 as a vulnerability in the Oracle MySQL Server and it is addressed in versions 5.1, 5.5, and 5.6 by the patch. The risk matrix states that an attacker needs "Single" authentication to exploit it and lists the impact as potential partial impact to integrity and availability.

The provided documents are consistent in identifying CVE-2013-3795 as a security vulnerability in MySQL related to DML operations, which could allow an attacker with a valid MySQL session to impact data integrity or availability.

The Oracle document provides more detail than the opensuse advisory, particularly in its risk matrix detailing the authentication level and the specific impacts.
