The provided content discusses two vulnerabilities in the Jomres component for Joomla!, which are:

**1. Script Insertion Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of input passed via the `property_name` POST parameter when editing property details.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization allows arbitrary HTML and script code to be inserted.
*   **Impact:**  Malicious script code can be executed in a user's browser session within the context of the affected site when malicious data is viewed.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Sending a crafted POST request with the malicious code in the `property_name` parameter while editing a property detail.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires "Business Manager" permissions on the Joomla site.

**2. SQL Injection Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper sanitization of input passed via the `id` GET parameter to `administrator/index.php` when `option` is set to `com_jomres` and `task` is set to `editProfile`.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization allows manipulation of SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete database information.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious GET request with SQL code injected into the `id` parameter while accessing `administrator/index.php` with the specific `option` and `task`.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires "Business Manager" permissions on the Joomla site.

The vulnerabilities were confirmed in version 7.3.0 of the Jomres component, and other versions may be affected. The solution is to update to version 7.3.1.
