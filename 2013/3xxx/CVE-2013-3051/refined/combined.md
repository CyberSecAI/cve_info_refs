Yesterday, news broke that Dan Rosenberg ([@djrbliss](https://twitter.com/djrbliss)) had [unlocked bootloaders for a handful of Motorola devices](https://www.droid-life.com/2013/04/07/bootloader-reportedly-unlocked-on-the-droid-razr-hd-razr-m-and-more/) including the [**DROID RAZR HD**](/tag/razr-hd), RAZR MAXX HD, RAZR M, and Atrix HD, all of which are powered by Qualcomm chipsets. Today, he has released that same unlock tool so that you can free your phone from Motorola and Verizon’s clutches.

We should point out that you cannot re-lock the phone after using this tool (at this point), and it does indeed void your warranty. Also, Motorola can more than likely patch this in a software update, so you may want to weigh your options here before long. It’s risky from a warranty and replacement standpoint to say the least. As always, proceed with caution.

You definitely need to be rooted ahead of time, prior to using this tool. For those with a **RAZR HD running Android 4.1.2** (the newest update), root has not been gained yet so you are out of luck for now. I can’t imagine that this won’t ever be rooted, but again as of today, there is no root method.

**Update**:  Dan released a root method for Android 4.1.2 that can be found [here](https://www.droid-life.com/2013/04/09/root-method-released-for-droid-razr-hd-running-android-4-1-2-other-devices-too/).

As we mentioned yesterday, this method does not work on OMAP powered phones, including the original RAZR, Bionic, and DROID 4. Do not attempt to use this on any of those phones.

Below, we have the basic instructions and notes from Dan.

#### A couple of warnings:

1. You understand that using this tool will permanently, irreversibly void your device’s warranty.
2. You understand that it may not be possible to “relock” your device’s bootloader after unlocking using this tool. A side effect of this is that if you lose your device and you are not using disk encryption, a malicious party who acquires your phone may be able to extract all personal data from the device regardless of any lock screen.
3. You agree that I am in no way responsible for any damage to your device as a result of using this tool.

#### Instructions:

> \*It requires that your device has been rooted and that the “su” binary has been properly installed.

1. Download [this file](http://vulnfactory.org/public/motopocalypse.zip) to your computer.
2. Extract the entire contents of the zip file.
3. If you are using Windows, ensure you have installed the latest Motorola USB drivers available for your phone.
4. Ensure your device has been rooted and you have a working installation of “su”.
5. Ensure USB Debugging mode is enabled on your device.
6. If you are using Windows, navigate to the extracted directory and execute “run.bat”. If you are using Linux or OS X, navigate to the extracted directory in a terminal and execute “./run.sh”.

*Note – If you are interested in reading exactly how Dan managed to find this exploit (all of the technical madness), he has written up an entire post about it over at [Azimuth Security](http://blog.azimuthsecurity.com/2013/04/unlocking-motorola-bootloader.html).*
