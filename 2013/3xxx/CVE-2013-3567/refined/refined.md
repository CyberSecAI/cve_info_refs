  "cve": "CVE-2013-3567",
  "description": "A flaw was found in the way Puppet handled YAML content during Representational State Transfer (REST) API calls. An attacker could construct a request containing a crafted YAML payload that would cause the Puppet master to execute arbitrary code.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of YAML content during REST API calls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization of YAML data",
       "Lack of proper input sanitization/validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the Puppet master server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted YAML payload within a REST API request to the Puppet master."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated attacker can send malicious REST API requests.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a specially crafted YAML payload within a REST API request. The Puppet master deserializes the YAML payload without proper sanitization or validation. This allows the attacker to create an object of an arbitrary Ruby class and execute code contained in the payload."
