Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from RT (Request Tracker) allowing direct requests to private callback components. Although no callback components ship with RT, this could be used to exploit an extension or local callback which uses the arguments passed to it insecurely.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The primary weakness is that RT does not properly restrict access to private callback components. It allows direct requests to these components.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a vulnerable custom callback component exists, an attacker can use this vulnerability to exploit it. If the callback is poorly implemented, they may be able to run arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a vulnerable callback component exists.
*   **Other Negative Side-Effects:** A malicious user could run private components, causing other unexpected negative side-effects, depending on what those components do.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending direct HTTP requests to private callback components within the RT application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the RT server.
*   They must also know the location of a vulnerable callback component.
*   The user must be able to see administration pages.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects RT versions 3.8.0 and above.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in RT versions 3.8.17 and 4.0.13, as well as in a security patch tarball.
