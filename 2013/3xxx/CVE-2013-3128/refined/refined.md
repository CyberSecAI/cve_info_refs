        "details": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows parses specially crafted OpenType fonts (OTF). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
