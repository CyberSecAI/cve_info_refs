# Install .NET Framework for developers

* Article
* 08/30/2022

Feedback

## In this article

.NET is an integral part of many apps running on Windows and provides common functionality for those apps to run. For developers, .NET Framework provides a comprehensive and consistent programming model for building apps that have visually stunning user experiences and seamless and secure communication.

Note

This article is intended for **developers** who either want to install .NET Framework on their own system or who want to install it with their applications. For **users** interested in installing .NET Framework, see the individual articles that discuss installing .NET Framework on specific operating systems, such as [Install .NET Framework on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016](on-windows-10).

This article provides links for installing all versions of .NET Framework from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET Framework 4.8.1 on your computer. If you're a developer, you can also use these links to download and redistribute .NET Framework with your apps. For information on deploying a version of .NET Framework with your app, see [.NET Framework deployment guide for developers](../deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers).

Important

.NET Framework content previously digitally signed using certificates that use the SHA1 algorithm, will be retired in order to support evolving industry standards.

The following versions of .NET Framework will reach end-of-support on *April 26, 2022*: 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6.1. After this date, security fixes, updates, and technical support for these versions will no longer be provided.

If you're using .NET Framework 4.5.2, 4.6, or 4.6.1, update your deployed runtime to a more recent version, such as **.NET Framework 4.6.2**, before *April 26, 2022* in order to continue to receive updates and technical support.

Updated SHA2 signed installers will be available for .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, and 4.6.2 through 4.8. For more information, see the [SHA1 retirement plan](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/-net-framework-retiring-sha-1-content-9750f20d-a9ef-4d43-853f-2075f0a9d7da), the [.NET 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6.1 lifecycle update blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-framework-4-5-2-4-6-4-6-1-will-reach-end-of-support-on-april-26-2022/), and the [FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/-net-framework-4-5-2-4-6-4-6-1-end-of-support-faq-72b7d8ca-3057-4f0c-8404-67305d40cc04).

Important

All .NET Framework versions since .NET Framework 4 are in-place updates, so only a single 4.x version can be present on a system. In addition, particular versions of .NET Framework are preinstalled on some versions of the Windows operating system. This means that:

* If there's a later 4.x version installed on the machine already, you can't install a previous 4.x version.
* If the OS comes preinstalled with a particular .NET Framework version, you can't install a previous 4.x version on the same machine.
* If you install a later version, you don't have to first uninstall the previous version.

For more information about versions of .NET Framework and how to determine which versions are installed on a computer, see [Versions and Dependencies](../migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies) and [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Versions Are Installed](../migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed).

Note

For information on .NET Framework 3.5, see [Install the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 8](dotnet-35-windows).

Use the following table for quick links, or read further for details. To view the system requirements for .NET Framework before installation, see [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements). For help with troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-blocked-installations-and-uninstallations).

Important

Starting with Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio no longer includes .NET Framework components for .NET Framework 4.0 - 4.5.1 because these versions are no longer supported. Visual Studio 2022 and later versions can't build apps that target .NET Framework 4.0 through .NET Framework 4.5.1. To continue building these apps, you can use Visual Studio 2019 or an earlier version.

You can install the **Developer Pack** for a specific version of the .NET Framework, if one is available, on all supported platforms.

**Developer Packs** only target a specific version of .NET Framework and don't include previous versions. For example, the .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack doesn't include .NET Framework 4.7.

You can install the **Web or Offline installer** on:

* Windows 8.1 and earlier
* Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier

For a full list, see [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements).

For a general introduction to .NET Framework for both users and developers, see [Getting Started](../get-started/). For information about deploying .NET Framework with your app, see the [deployment guide](../deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers). To read about the architecture and key features of .NET Framework, see the [overview](../get-started/overview).

## Installation choices

Install a developer targeting pack to develop against the most recent version of .NET Framework in Visual Studio or another development environment, or download the .NET Framework redistributable for distribution with your app or control.

### To install the .NET Framework Developer Pack or Targeting Pack

A *targeting pack* lets your app target a specific version of .NET Framework when developing in Visual Studio and some other development environments. A *developer pack* includes a specific version of .NET Framework and its accompanying SDK along with its corresponding targeting pack.

The developer pack for .NET Framework 4.5.1 or 4.5.2, the targeting pack for .NET Framework 4.6, and the developer pack for .NET Framework 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, or 4.8 provides a particular .NET Framework's version of the reference assemblies, language packs, and IntelliSense files for use in an integrated development environment such as Visual Studio. If you're using Visual Studio, the developer pack or targeting pack also adds the installed version of .NET Framework to the target choices when you create a new project. Choose one of the following:

* [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
* [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
* [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
* [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
* [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
* [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
* [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452) to install version 4.5.2 on Windows 8.1 or earlier, Visual Studio 2013, Visual Studio 2012, or other IDEs.
* [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451) to install version 4.5.1 on Visual Studio 2012 or other IDEs.

From the developer pack download page, choose **Download**. Next, choose **Run** or **Save**, and follow the instructions when prompted. You can also install the developer pack or targeting pack for a specific version of .NET Framework by selecting it from the optional components in the **.NET desktop development** workload in the Visual Studio Installer, as the following figure shows.

[![Visual Studio installer with .NET Framework options selected.](media/guide-for-developers/visual-studio-framework.png)](media/guide-for-developers/visual-studio-framework-large.png#lightbox)

When you target a particular version of .NET Framework, your application is built by using the reference assemblies that are included with that version's developer pack. At run time, assemblies are resolved from the Global Assembly Cache, and the reference assemblies are not used.

When building an application from Visual Studio or using MSBuild from the command line, MSBuild may display error MSB3644, "The reference assemblies for framework "*framework-version*" were not found." To address the error, download the developer pack or the targeting pack for that version of .NET Framework.

### To install or download the .NET Framework redistributable

Installers download .NET Framework components for an app or control that targets those versions of .NET Framework. These components must be installed on each computer where the app or control runs. These installers are redistributable, so you can include them in the setup program for your app.

The download page is provided in several languages, but most of the downloads are provided in English only. For additional language support, you must install a language pack.

Two types of redistributable installers are available:

* **Web installer** (web bootstrapper) downloads the required components and the language pack that matches the operating system of the installation computer from the web. This package is much smaller than the offline installer but requires a consistent Internet connection. You can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install additional language support.
* **Offline installer** (standalone redistributable) contains all the required components for installing .NET Framework but doesn't contain language packs. This download is larger than the web installer. The offline installer doesn't require an internet connection. After you run the offline installer, you can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install language support. Use the offline installer if you can't rely on having a consistent Internet connection.

Both web and offline installers are designed for x86-based and x64-based computers (see [system requirements](../get-started/system-requirements)), but do not support Itanium-based computers.

1. Open the download page for the .NET Framework version you want to install:

   * [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
   * [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)
2. Select the language for the download page. This option does not download the localized resources of .NET Framework; it only affects the text displayed on the download page.
3. Choose **Download**.
4. If prompted, select the download that matches your system architecture, and then choose **Next**.
5. When the download prompt appears, do *one* of the following:

   * If you want to install .NET Framework on your computer, choose **Run**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.
   * If you want to download .NET Framework for redistribution, choose **Save**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.
6. If you want to download resources for additional languages, follow the instructions in the next section to install one or more language packs.

Note

If you encounter any problems during the installation, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-blocked-installations-and-uninstallations).

**Installation notes:**

* .NET Framework 4.5 and later versions replace .NET Framework 4.0. When you install these versions on a system that has .NET Framework 4 installed, the assemblies are replaced.
* Uninstalling .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions also removes pre-existing .NET Framework 4 files. If you want to go back to .NET Framework 4, you must reinstall it and any updates to it. See [Installing the .NET Framework 4](/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/5a4x27ek%28v%3Dvs.100%29).
* You must have administrative credentials to install .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions.
* The .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable was updated on October 9, 2012 to correct an issue related to an improper timestamp on a digital certificate, which caused the digital signature on files produced and signed by Microsoft to expire prematurely. If you previously installed the .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable package dated August 16, 2012, we recommend that you update your copy with the latest redistributable from the [.NET Framework download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45). For more information about this issue, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2749655](/en-us/security-updates/SecurityAdvisories/2012/2749655).

## To install language packs

Language packs are executable files that contain the localized resources (such as translated error messages and UI text) for supported languages. If you don't install a language pack, .NET Framework error messages and other text are displayed in English. Note that the web installer automatically installs the language pack that matches your operating system, but you can download additional language packs to your computer. The offline installers don't include any language packs.

Important

The language packs don't contain the .NET Framework components that are required to run an app, so you must run the web or offline installer before you install a language pack. If you have already installed a language pack, uninstall it, install the .NET Framework, and then reinstall the language pack.

1. Open the language pack download page for the .NET Framework version you've installed:

   * [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
   * [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)
2. In the language list, choose the language you want to download, and wait a few seconds for the page to reload in that language.
3. Choose **Download**.

The following table lists the supported languages.

| Language | Culture |
| --- | --- |

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-081 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2870008)

Published: October 08, 2013 | Updated: January 14, 2014

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves seven privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views shared content that embeds OpenType or TrueType font files. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows except Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Windows handles specially crafted OpenType Font files and specially crafted TrueType Font (TTF) files, and by correcting the way that Windows handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## OpenType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3128

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows parses specially crafted OpenType fonts (OTF). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3128](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3128).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, the Preview and Details panes are disabled in Windows Explorer in Windows 8. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

**Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer**

Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents OTF fonts from being viewed in Windows Explorer. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

To disable these panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
2. Clear both the **Details** pane and **Preview** pane menu options.
3. Close all open instances of Windows Explorer.

**Impact of workaround**. Windows Explorer will not display OTF fonts.

**How to undo the workaround**

To re-enable the Windows Explorer Preview pane and Details pane in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2:

1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
2. Select both the **Details** pane and **Preview** pane menu options.
3. Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Windows does not properly parse OpenType fonts.

**What is fontembedding?**

Font embedding, supported through Microsoft OpenType and TrueType specifications, is a feature of Microsoft applications that enables fonts to be embedded in a document. This ensures that a user views the document exactly as the author intended. The Web Embedding Fonts Tool (WEFT) lets web authors create font objects that are linked to their webpages so that when viewed through the browser, pages are displayed in the style contained in the font object. For more information, see [About Font Embedding](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533034.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could convince a user to visit a malicious webpage that contains a specifically crafted embedded font. When the user visits the malicious site, the vulnerability could result in remote code execution as the embedded font is parsed and displayed.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Windows parses OpenType fonts.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

## TrueType Font CMAP Table Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3894

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows parses specially crafted TrueType fonts (TTF). An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3894](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3894).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* By default, the Preview and Details panes are disabled in Windows Explorer in Windows 8. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

**Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer**

Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents OTF fonts from being viewed in Windows Explorer. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability.

To disable these panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
2. Clear both the **Details** pane and **Preview** pane menu options.
3. Close all open instances of Windows Explorer.

**Impact of workaround**. Windows Explorer will not display OTF fonts.

**How to undo the workaround**

To re-enable the Windows Explorer Preview pane and Details pane in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2:

1. Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.
2. Select both the **Details** pane and **Preview** pane menu options.
3. Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver does not properly parse the CMAP table when rendering a specially crafted TrueType font.

**What is fontembedding?**

Font embedding, supported through Microsoft OpenType and TrueType specifications, are a feature of Microsoft applications that enables fonts to be embedded in a document. This ensures that a user views the document exactly as the author intended. The Web Embedding Fonts Tool (WEFT) lets web authors create font objects that are linked to their webpages so that when viewed through the browser, pages are displayed in the style contained in the font object. For more information, see [About Font Embedding](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms533034.aspx).

**What is a CMAP table?**

A CMAP table defines the mapping of character codes to the glyph index values used in the font. It may contain more than one sub-table in order to support more than one character encoding scheme. The table header indicates the character encodings for which sub-tables are present. Each sub-table is in one of seven possible formats and begins with a format code indicating the format used. For more information, see [Character to Glyph Index Mapping Table](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/cmap.htm).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could convince a user to visit a malicious webpage that contains a specially crafted embedded font. When the user visits the malicious site, the vulnerability could result in remote code execution as the embedded font is parsed and displayed.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2878890)

Published: October 8, 2013 | Updated: April 7, 2016

**Version:** 1.2

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user visits a website containing a specially crafted OpenType font (OTF) file using a browser capable of instantiating XBAP applications.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, Microsoft .NET Framework 4, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 on affected editions of Microsoft Windows; it is rated Important for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 and Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 on affected editions of Microsoft Windows.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by ensuring that the .NET Framework properly handles OpenType fonts, XML digital signatures, and document type definitions in JSON data encodings. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## OpenType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3128

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected components handle specially crafted OpenType fonts (OTF). The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user visits a website hosting an XAML Browser Application (XBAP) containing a specially crafted OTF file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3128](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3128).

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework attempts to parse a specially crafted OpenType font (OTF) embedded in an XAML Browser Application (XBAP).

**What is the OpenType font format?**

OpenType is a font format developed jointly by Microsoft and Adobe as an extension of Apple's TrueType font format. An OpenType font file contains data, in table format, that comprises either a TrueType or a PostScript outline font. Rasterizers use combinations of data from the tables contained in the font to render the TrueType or PostScript glyph outlines. For more information, see the [Microsoft Typography OpenType FAQ](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/opentypefaq.mspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In a web-browsing scenario, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on behalf of the targeted user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an attack scenario, an attacker could host an XAML Browser Application (XBAP) containing a specially crafted OTF file on a website. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit such a website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website. It could also be possible for an attacker exploit this vulnerability by embedding specially crafted web content in banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems.

**What is an XAML Browser Application (XBAP)?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both a web application and a rich-client application. Like web applications, XBAPs can be published to a web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any systems running the affected versions of .NET Framework are affected by this vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

In the web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting websites using a web browser capable of instantiating XBAP applications. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that the .NET Framework properly handles OpenType fonts.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Entity Expansion Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3860

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the .NET Framework that could allow an attacker to cause a server or application to crash or become unresponsive.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3860](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3860).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Affected systems do not accept and validate XML digital signatures by default. An application on an affected system must be specifically coded to accept this type of data and subsequently validate its authenticity. Also, if the specially crafted XML data is not persistent, then application responsiveness is restored after a restart and will remain so unless the specially crafted data is reintroduced.

### Workarounds

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework attempts to parse a specially crafted document type definition (DTD) for XML data when an XML digital signature is validated.

**What is DTD?**

DTD, standing for document type definition, is a file format type that is used in XML and other markup languages to identify the markup to be used to format a document.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these cause an application or server to crash or become unresponsive until an administrator restarts the application or server.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an attack scenario, the attacker would send digitally signed XML data with a specially crafted DTD to an application that parses and validates XML data with digital signatures.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any systems running the affected versions of .NET Framework are affected by this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that the .NET Framework properly validates XML digital signatures.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## JSON Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3861

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the .NET Framework that could allow an attacker to cause a server or application to crash or become unresponsive.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3861](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3861).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Only affected servers become unresponsive in an attack scenario; affected client systems are impacted in that their communication with an unresponsive server prevents them from rendering application content.
* Affected systems do not accept and validate JSON data by default. An application on an affected system must be specifically coded to accept this type of data and subsequently validate its authenticity. If the specially crafted JSON data is not persistent, then application responsiveness is restored after a restart. Only if an affected server accepts user input and sends it to a client system will the client system become unresponsive.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

JSON, standing for JavaScript Object Notation, is an open standard format for human-readable data interchange. It is based on the JavaScript scripting language, but supports many languages and is mainly used to transmit data between servers and web applications.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause an application or server to crash or become unresponsive until an administrator restarts the application or server.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In an attack scenario, an attacker would send JSON data with a specific character sequences to an application that parses JSON data.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any systems running the affected versions of .NET Framework are affected by this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that the .NET Framework properly handles JSON data encodings.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
