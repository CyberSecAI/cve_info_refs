    "root_cause": "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application reflects error messages containing user-provided URL input directly to the browser without proper input validation and output encoding.",
      "Insufficient input validation and output encoding.",
      "The application attempts to remove event attributes by keyword - anything with the letters “on” (such as “onmouseover”) are removed, but this can be bypassed using null bytes (%00).",
       "The additional validation step of removing closing brackets (“>” ) is also insufficient because some browsers, such as Internet Explorer, will tolerate lack of closing brackets and execute the HTML regardless."

    "impact": "An attacker can conduct a reflected XSS attack, whereby an attacker can pass a crafted link to a user which when clicked, executes malicious JavaScript to attack the user.",
    "attack_vectors": "A crafted link containing malicious JavaScript is passed to a user, who executes the script when visiting the link.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and convince a user to click on it."
