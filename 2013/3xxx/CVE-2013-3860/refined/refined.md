Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3860:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how the .NET Framework parses a specially crafted Document Type Definition (DTD) within XML data when validating an XML digital signature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Entity Expansion vulnerability**: Improper handling of DTDs in XML digital signature validation leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can cause a server or application to crash or become unresponsive, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The application or server would need to be restarted by an administrator.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker sends digitally signed XML data containing a specially crafted DTD to a .NET Framework application designed to parse and validate XML data with digital signatures.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted XML data to the vulnerable application.
- The target application must be designed to parse and validate XML digital signatures.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is triggered during the validation of XML digital signatures when a specially crafted DTD is present in the XML data.
- The vulnerability does not affect systems by default as they do not accept and validate XML digital signatures unless they are explicitly coded to do so.
- If the malformed XML data is not persistent, the application responsiveness is restored after a restart.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of this security bulletin.
- Microsoft had not received any reports of this vulnerability being actively exploited at the time this bulletin was released.
