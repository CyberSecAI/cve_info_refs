Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the Windows kernel not properly validating address values within the NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) subsystem, which can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory address validation in the Windows kernel, specifically within the NTVDM.
- Memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can achieve:
  - Arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.
  - Installation of programs.
  - Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
  - Creation of new accounts with full user rights.
  - Elevation of privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker runs a specially crafted application designed to trigger the memory corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Requires the ability to log on to the targeted system.
- Requires the ability to execute a specially crafted application.

**Additional Information:**
- 64-bit versions of Windows are not affected by this specific vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is addressed by changing how the Windows kernel validates memory address values.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mateusz "j00ru" Jurczyk of Google Inc.
- This CVE is related to other NTVDM vulnerabilities: CVE-2013-3196 and CVE-2013-3197, where the memory corruption occurs due to similar failures to validate addresses in kernel memory.
- Workarounds include disabling the NTVDM subsystem via Group Policy or the Windows Registry, which will prevent the execution of 16-bit applications.
