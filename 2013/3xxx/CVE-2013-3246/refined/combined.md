During fuzzing of XnView 1.99.6 XCF file format our research lab has identified multiple vulnerabilities in XCF file format processor. A number of them allowed code execution in the tested application. XCF file format abbreviation stands for eXperimental Computing Facility image format. Two of the found vulnerabilities were passed to Secunia at 2013.03.06. Selected samples allowed to trigger heap overflow and stack overflow. After the new version of XnView 2.00 was published, issue was revisited. One of the found and reported vulnerabilities is exploited in the following presentation.
