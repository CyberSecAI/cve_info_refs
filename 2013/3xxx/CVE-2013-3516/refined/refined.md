      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-3516",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": "This document describes vulnerabilities found in multiple SOHO routers, including the Netgear WNR3500. The vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to take full control of the router's configuration settings, and in some cases, a local attacker to bypass authentication directly. The Netgear WNR3500 is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack that allows a remote attacker to gain control of the router. The router uses HTML form tokens to prevent CSRF, but they are based on the router's current date and time. Because the router synchronizes its date and time with NTP servers, an attacker can easily guess the CSRF tokens. The researchers created a proof of concept that enables remote management and Telnet access to the router by attempting to use every HTML form token that could have been generated in the previous 20 minutes. A local authentication bypass vulnerability is also mentioned and is used in conjunction with the CSRF vulnerability to gain control.",
        "root_cause": "The root cause of the CSRF vulnerability lies in the insecure generation of anti-CSRF tokens. These tokens are based solely on the router's current date and time which is obtained from NTP servers. This predictability allows attackers to easily generate valid tokens.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure CSRF token generation based on predictable time values.",
        "Local authentication bypass vulnerability.",
        "Telnet service running by default on port 23, with weak authentication."
      ],
      "impact": "A successful attack can give a remote adversary full control over the victim router. This includes the ability to intercept and modify network traffic, as well as change the router's configuration.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "Remote attack via CSRF, requiring an active management session from the victim and a malicious action (e.g. clicking a link).",
          "Local attack requiring physical access or compromising a device on the local network."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a link or browsing to a malicious page to exploit the remote CSRF vulnerability. For a local attack, the attacker needs to be on the local network. For the Netgear WNR3500, the attacker also requires knowledge of, or be able to bruteforce the device's MAC address to leverage the Telnet vulnerability once enabled by the CSRF attack."
