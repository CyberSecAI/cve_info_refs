  "CVE-2013-3727": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient validation of the \"groups\" HTTP POST parameter passed to the \"/admin.php\" script.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection [CWE-89]"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote authenticated administrator can execute arbitrary SQL commands in the application's database. A remote non-authenticated attacker can also exploit this vulnerability via CSRF.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST parameter manipulation",
	  "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "For direct exploitation, attacker must be an authenticated administrator. For CSRF exploitation, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page.",
	"additional_information": "The provided exploit code uses a DNS exfiltration technique to extract data from the database by querying a subdomain controlled by the attacker."
