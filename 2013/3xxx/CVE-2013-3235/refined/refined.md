  "CVE-2013-3235": {
    "description": "An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's TIPC (Transparent Inter Process Communication) protocol implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel's stack memory.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `set_orig_addr()` function in `net/tipc/socket.c` does not initialize all members of the `sockaddr_tipc` struct, leading to uninitialized stack memory being copied to the `msg_name` field in `net/socket.c`. Additionally, `recv_msg()` and `recv_stream()` do not set `msg_namelen` to 0 when they return early without filling the `msg_name` field, leading to information leaks from stack memory.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper initialization of data structures",
         "Missing update of length field for socket address."
      ],
       "impact": "Local users can leak up to 128 bytes of kernel stack memory by using `recvmsg(2)`/`recvfrom(2)`.",
      "attack_vectors": "By making recvmsg(2) or recvfrom(2) calls, an unprivileged local user can read kernel memory.",
      "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged local user"
    },
    "affected_components": [
      "net/tipc/socket.c"
