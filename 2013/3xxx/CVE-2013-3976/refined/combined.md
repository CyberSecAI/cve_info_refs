# Security Bulletin: Possibility for Accidental Disclosure of Microsoft Exchange Mailboxes to Unauthorized Users (CVE-2013-3976)

### Flashes (Alerts)

## Abstract

Due to a problem in the Data Protection for Exchange and FlashCopy Manager for Exchange components, once a mailbox is restored into a .PST file, each individual .PST file will be created as expected, but the contents of that .PST file may not be the contents associated with that mailbox name.

# IC81223: MAILBOX DATA IS SAVED TO THE WRONG .PST FILE WHEN RESTORING MULTIPLE MAILBOXES TO .PST FILES IN ONE COMMAND.

## Subscribe

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  When using Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail: Data
  Protection for Microsoft Exchange 6.1 to perform a restore
  to PST files for multiple mailboxes with either the GUI
  or the command line, the .PST files are created as expected.

  For example the below command:

  tdpexcc RESTOREMailbox "user_a","user_b", ... user_z"
  /MAILBOXRESTOREDESTination PST,D:\Tmp\pst

  results in the creation of the following .PST files :

  D:\Tmp\pst\user_a.pst
  D:\Tmp\pst\user_b.pst
  ...
  D:\Tmp\pst\user_z.pst

  In this case, the maibox data is restored in alphabetical
  order but:
  - the the two first mailboxes (user_a and user_b) will both
    be restored to 'D:\Tmp\pst\user_a.pst'
  - then the mailbox for user_c will be restored to
    'D:\Tmp\pst\user_b.pst'
  - and the mailbox for user_d will be restored to
    'D:\Tmp\pst\user_c.pst'
    and so on.

  Therefore, following this pattern, the last mailbox for
  user_z will be restored to 'D:\Tmp\pst\user_y.pst'
  and the last .PST file 'D:\Tmp\pst\user_z.pst' will be empty.

  Versions Affected: Data Protection for Exchange 6.1, 6.3
                     on windows

  Initial Impact: Medium
  Additional Keywords: TDP FCM
