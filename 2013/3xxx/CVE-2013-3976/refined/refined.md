Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3976:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an error in how IBM Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail: Data Protection for Microsoft Exchange and FlashCopy Manager for Exchange handle multiple mailbox restores to .PST files. Instead of correctly mapping mailbox data to their respective .PST files, the restore process writes the data to the wrong file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect mapping of mailbox data to .PST files during a multi-mailbox restore.
- Mailbox data is written to the .pst file of the previous mailbox in the alphabetical order list of mailboxes to be restored.
- The last .pst file in the list is left empty.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Accidental disclosure of mailbox contents to unauthorized users
- The .pst files created do not contain the data associated with their filenames.
- Data loss/corruption if users rely on the .pst files to restore the data.
- Users may access data not belonging to them.

**Attack vectors:**
- Performing a multi-mailbox restore operation using the affected software via the GUI or command-line interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail or FlashCopy Manager for Exchange environment.
- Ability to initiate a restore operation of multiple mailboxes to .PST files.
- No specific position within the network/system is mentioned, but access to the system is necessary.

**Additional details:**
- The issue affects versions 6.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.2, 6.1.3, and 6.3 of Data Protection for Microsoft Exchange and versions 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, and 3.1 of FlashCopy Manager for Exchange.
- A temporary workaround was to perform restores on one mailbox at a time, this was later fixed in version 6.3.1.
- The restore is processed in alphabetical order, shifting each mailbox to the .pst file of the previous mailbox in the list, and leaving the final file empty.
- The vulnerability was addressed in a later fix pack.
