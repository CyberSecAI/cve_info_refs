- Failure to properly restrict the resolution of external entities within XML documents, leading to a potential information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could read data from files on the target system.
- The vulnerability does not allow for direct code execution or privilege escalation, but it can provide information that may be used for further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Office file to a user and convince them to open it.
- **Web-based:** An attacker can host a website containing a specially crafted Office file or exploit compromised websites, convincing users to open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a specially crafted Office file containing malicious XML external entities.
