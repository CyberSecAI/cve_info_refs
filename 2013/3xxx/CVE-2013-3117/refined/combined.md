# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-047 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (2838727)

Published: June 11, 2013

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves nineteen privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, and Internet Explorer 10 on Windows clients and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, Internet Explorer 9, and Internet Explorer 10 on Windows servers. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Internet Explorer Script Debug Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3126

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly processes script while debugging a webpage. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user within Internet Explorer. An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3126](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3126).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email, and then convince users to debug the malicious web content.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2012 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for the vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, script debugging is not enabled in Internet Explorer.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Do not debug script on untrusted webpages or webpages that you do not control**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to debug script on a malicious webpage. Do not enable script debugging in Internet Explorer and do not debug webpages from untrusted sources or sources that you do not control.

  In a default configuration, script debugging is not enabled in Internet Explorer. However, even when script debugging is not enabled, it is still possible for a user to debug script. A user would have to press **F12** to display the developer tools pane, and then click **Start debugging** from the **Script** tab while visiting a malicious webpage. **Note** To block the developer tools attack vector, administrators can use group policy to disable F12 developer tools.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email, and then convince users to debug the malicious web content.

In a default configuration, script debugging is not enabled in Internet Explorer. In this case, an attacker would have to convince a user to press **F12** to display the developer tools pane, and then click **Start debugging** from the **Script** tab while visiting a malicious webpage.

In a non-default scenario with script debugging enabled, a user could be prompted to debug a webpage they are visiting if the webpage contains script errors. An attacker would have to convince the user to visit a malicious webpage that contained script errors and then convince the user to click **Yes** when prompted to debug the webpage.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes.
