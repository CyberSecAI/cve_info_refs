{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from the way Internet Explorer improperly handles objects in memory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory corruption"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the same user rights as the current user. This could allow an attacker to gain full control of the system if the user has administrative privileges, enabling them to install programs, view, modify or delete data, and create new accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince a user to view it. This could be achieved through phishing emails, instant messaging links, or compromising legitimate websites.",
    "An attacker could also leverage compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content or ads."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a malicious website. The attacker has no way to force the user to visit the website and relies on social engineering or other methods to achieve this."
