Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3686:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the exposure of sensitive information by accessing a specific URL on the Airlive IP camera.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** The camera exposes sensitive information like user IDs and encoded passwords through a specific URL.
*   **Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls (CWE-264):** The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation, as the exposed information can be used to gain administrative access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can obtain sensitive user data, including encoded administrator passwords.
*   By decoding the password, an attacker can gain administrative access to the camera, leading to full control over the device and its functionalities.
*   This could result in unauthorized viewing of video feeds, modification of settings, or further malicious activities within the network.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by accessing a specific URL: `/cgi-bin/operator/param?action=list&group=General.UserID`. This URL directly exposes the sensitive information.
*   The attack is performed remotely through the web interface of the camera.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IP camera.
*   The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable URL to access the information. No authentication is required to access the vulnerable URL.
*   The attacker needs to be able to decode the base64 encoded password.

**Additional Information:**

*   The specific product affected is the Airlive WL2600CAM.
*   The exposed password is base64 encoded.
*   The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation by using the exposed information to login as admin.
