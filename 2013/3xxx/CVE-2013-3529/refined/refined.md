  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-3529",
      "root_cause": "The WordPress plugin 'FuneralPress' versions 1.1.6 and prior, is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via multiple input fields.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Stored XSS vulnerability exists in the `photo-message`, `youtube-message`, and `message` textarea elements within the guestbook form."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to: \n - Malicious script execution as a WordPress administrator, when they access the guestbook admin page.\n - If a malicious post is approved by the admin, the script will be run by anyone viewing the guestbook.\n - Potential manipulation of the admin page by rewriting elements.\n - Cookie theft.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A low-privilege or guest user can inject malicious code into the specified textarea fields by submitting a form through the `/obituaries/?id=[ID]&f=guestbook&m=add` URL. "
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit the guestbook form. No authentication is needed for posting as a guest. The attacker can also be a low-privilege user.",
      "additional_details": "XSS protection on the `message` textarea is bypassed with the use of iframe or embed tags. The `photo-message` and `youtube-message` fields do not have any protection, allowing for direct execution on the admin page when reviewing posts."
