Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an unpatched backdoor within Atlassian Crowd, a single sign-on (SSO) and user authentication solution. The specific details of the backdoor are not disclosed in the provided document but are mentioned in a separate threat advisory PDF.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Backdoor:** The core vulnerability is the existence of a backdoor that allows remote access and control. The advisory suggests it's likely a symmetric backdoor due to indicators such as covert positioning, special parameters, lack of logging, and facilitated persistence

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Server Control:** Successful exploitation of the backdoor allows an attacker to take full control of the Crowd server.
- **Credential Compromise:** It "invariably" results in the compromise of all application and user credentials.
- **Data Breach:** Leads to the compromise of accessible data storage.
- **Directory Access:** Enables access to configured directories, like Active Directory.
- **Dependent System Compromise:** Can lead to the compromise of dependent systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The backdoor allows for remote exploitation. The specific method of remote access isn't detailed in the provided text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to remotely access the vulnerable Crowd server.
- **Exploitation Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to trigger and use the backdoor vulnerability to gain control.

**Additional Notes:**
- The information is based on a threat advisory from Command Five, specifically a PDF document, and this Slashdot article is reporting on that advisory.
- Atlassian was aware of the advisory, but according to the comments, the specific vulnerability was not disclosed to them at the time of the posting of the article.
- The vulnerability affects Atlassian Crowd, which is used for enterprise single sign-on and user authentication, and integrations with other products like JIRA, Confluence, etc.
- Some users suggest that the embedded version of Crowd in JIRA might be affected, but this isn't confirmed in this document.
- The article also suggests a lack of logging for the exploitation of this vulnerability making it more difficult to detect.
