An anonymous reader writes *"Recently published on the Command Five website is a [technically detailed threat advisory (PDF)](http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_TA_2013_3925_AtlassianCrowd.pdf) in relation to a recurring vulnerability in Atlassian Crowd. Tucked away inconspicuously at the end of this document in a section entitled 'Unpatched Vulnerabilities' is the real security bombshell: Atlassian's turnkey solution for enterprise single sign-on and secure user authentication contains an unpatched backdoor. The backdoor allows anyone to remotely take full control of a Crowd server and, according to Command Five, successful exploitation 'invariably' results in compromise of all application and user credentials as well as accessible data storage, configured directories (for example Active Directory), and dependent systems."*

            Having just googled again, I still see nothing that is actually *informative* from the top 10 results. Most point to Atlassian's site. They have the uaual marketing blurb:

            Identity Management for Web Apps

            Finally, a single sign-on and user identity tool that's easy to use, administer, and integrate.

            Users can come from anywhere – Active Directory, LDAP, Crowd itself, or any mix thereof. Control permissions to all your applications in one place – Atlassian, Subversion, Google Apps, your own apps.

            Great! It's a way to sign into webapps. How enlightening. I have gotten a better description of it from the complaint posts below, than from searching for it in your approved way. But thank you for your concern of my inertial-challanged state.

      Atlassian's most famous product is Jira, which is pretty commonly used in large-scale businesses. Large-scale businesses are also more likely to use SSO, since it's less trouble than maintaining dozens of app-specific login subsystems.

      So the net result is effectively that the login ID is "sa" and the password is blank and everyone from the NSA to the Brothers of the Islamic Revolution of Upper West Turdistan, the New Reform Church of Neo-Communist Mao-fu-tze, the haXors Anymous 7EEt, the 57th-Street Beagle

    It appears to be some sort of software managing logins to sites. Their site cites their clientele to be a lot of major companies, such as facebook, twitter, hulu and netflix.

    I imagine if you have a backdoor into software that manages facebook's login systems, that's pretty damn major.

            Actually you can hook Jira into Stash, which is a GIT repo server, hook that into FishEye/Crucible which is a code review portal and hooked into Jenkins, thereby creating a nearly round trip QA process.

            QA creates a ticket, developer sees ticket, creates a branch from it, commits code, gets peer review after which the code is deployed to a QA server, ticket is moved back to a QA user who has a link to the QA server (typically a unique server instance is spun up for each ticket), QA confirms - this spins down the QA server instance and a pull request is made for the production branch.

            So there you go. Automated code deployment with useful checkpoints in a workflow process.

            Don't be jealous.

    Well, let's read the summary:
    "Atlassian's turnkey solution for enterprise single sign-on and secure user authentication"
    So Atlassian is some company, and it's a single sign-on/authentication system used in businesses.
    And it lets a remote attacker take control of the servers it runs on, and possibly other computers in the business (via Active Directory, which is Microsoft's system administration/management package.)

    They make Jira and Confluence... 2 applications that are widely used by some IS departments to manage their work. Jira for example, is an application for tracking software development, deployment and bugs. It's basically a ticketing system for programmers. You can track who created what, which bugs showed up in it later, who fixed them, how long all that took, etc...

    I'm not sure how many people are using their LDAP/SSO stuff though though. There are lot bigger (and clearly more trustworthy) providers in town.

      All of the individual apps can be tied to AD (or another directory) directly. Crowd is pretty much what you use when you want single sign-on/centralized auth, but you don't want to deploy AD or go through the pain in the ass of setting up and maintaining your own LDAP server.

      I've also seen it used in large enterprises which have multiple authentication sources, the kind where systems just kind of creep, but no one wants to take the time (or risk the downtime) for consolidation. In that scenario, it's alot easier to tie the apps to Crowd for authentication, and then you just need to manage authentication sources in Crowd, instead of individually on the apps.

      Atlassian actually makes some pretty good software, and their prices are reasonable for their starter kits to get used to it. My only gripe is that it's all pretty much Tomcat based

          There's not a single major piece of software that hasn't had security flaws at one point or another. Remember when OpenBSD's web page bragged about no remote security holes in the default install? Even they've had two, and those boys are the epitome of paranoid security freaks.

          So I can forgive Atlassian to a degree, as long as they fix the damn thing, and fix it in a hurry. If your standard of 'good' software is no security holes at all, then I'm afraid you're going to have to log off and go back to playing with Lego's.

          Some of Atlassian's software is easy to use, and some of it can overwhelm a user. I've ran into a few coworkers who hated Confluence, and it was because they couldn't figure out how to do what they wanted. After I showed them, the gripes mysteriously disappeared. Confluence and JIRA are good pieces of software. Not perfect, but they serve their purpose.

        There are worse things a J2EE-based applications to run under. Since Tomcat supports the essentials without the overhead of supporting the full stack, it has very modest resource requirements compared to, for example, WebSphere or JBoss.

        Of course, Jetty is also lightweight, but Jetty isn't as commonly used or supported these days.

        It may be a factor of whether you're talking as a user or as an administrator.

        I can't speak authoritatively to JIRA as a product I'm responsible for -- I never owned a JIRA installation (well, not one with significant volume) -- but I use JIRA, and we use JIRA here, for a whole crapton of things from change tickets to production emergency handling, to task handling, to all development tasks. As a software engineer, and a software engineering manager, I love it -- and so do most of the other users we have here.

        It helps that we think of this kind of stuff as something you should actually invest in, and we have someone who probably has about 50% of his time dedicated to making JIRA run and making it work better for us. I've always found that bug/defect/issue/task tracking systems are better, and make their users happier, when they have a champion who's allowed to invest real resources in their care and feeding.

      > But then again, I don't use ghostery, don't know what it is, never heard of it, don't use it and wonder why you expect Atlassian to craft their software stack against third party software.

      It's a browser plugin for blocking intrusive tracking elements in web sites. I've never had it cause trouble with any other web site besides those that intentionally require you to submit to tracking (e.g. airport wi-fi sign-on pages), but those sites will usually detect the elements being blocked and give you an upfront message about it. It's almost like Atlassian went out of their way to make their stuff *not* work with Ghostery.

      > From the tone of your post, you are just leaping at a chance for a cheap jab at Atlassian with trumped up nonsense.

      From the tone of your post you are a shill who has something to gain from Atlassian sales, jumping at a chance for a cheap sales pitch with vague anecdotes.

      > Personally, I enjoy the Atlassian stack, find it unrivaled in feature coverage and have migrated many clients to the Atlassian stack.

      Ah, right. You sell Atlassian software. Can you say "conflict of interest"?

        No, I don't sell Atlassian Software, I consult startups for a living.
        I get nothing from Atlassian, and don't put all my clients on Atlassian.
        Many of them I put on Github Enterprise.

        It depends on the client, the product, the development cycle, the team, and the roadmap.
        But hey -- don't let that stop you from making wild and baseless accusations.

    you read one or more risks digests (which used to be a name for a thing, dunno if it still is) as well as whatever security-related information your vendor puts out. If your vendor doesn't make reports of this sort of thing via some sort of standard vector, it's time to start shopping for a new solution.

  Unless it starts to really, really hurt selling this kind of trash, not fixing \_known\_ vulnerabilities and not using secure coding practices, nothing will change. It is just cheaper this way and most customers do not care or cannot do anything anyways. One reason surely is managers at the customers that made this broken decision or supported it and now cannot back out without hurting themselves. Another is that absolutely nothing is going to happen to the vendor legally.

  Unless we start to require sound secure software engineering practices OR ELSE! nothing will change.

My personal install is also virtualized on VMWare, and I just tossed 4 gigs of memory and 2 vCPU's at it, and it works fine.

    I work for Atlassian and the author has not yet disclosed the vulnerability described in the "UNPATCHED VULNERABILITIES" section to us.

    Atlassian provides source code for most of our products (including Crowd) to paying customers. We would never deliberately build a backdoor into any of our products and I personally would never work for a company that would do that.
