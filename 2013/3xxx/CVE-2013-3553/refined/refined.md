- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by affected Nitro PDF software attempting to write data to an invalid memory address while parsing a specially crafted PDF file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap corruption vulnerability exists in Nitro Pro (version 7.5.0.22 and earlier) and Nitro Reader (version 2.5.0.36 and earlier) due to improper memory handling when parsing specially crafted PDF files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction. Attackers can deliver the malicious PDF file via email (as an attachment), instant messaging or by hosting the file on a malicious website. The user would need to open the file using a vulnerable version of Nitro PDF software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to create a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the vulnerability and then trick the user into opening the file using vulnerable versions of Nitro Pro or Nitro Reader software.
