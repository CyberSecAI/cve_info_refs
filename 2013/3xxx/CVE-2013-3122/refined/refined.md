Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3122:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing an object in memory. This improper memory access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability that arises when Internet Explorer handles objects in memory incorrectly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the currently logged-in user. This means the attacker gains the same level of user rights as the user running the browser.
- **System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, potentially installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through a specially crafted website.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers may compromise legitimate websites, or take advantage of websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements to deliver the malicious content.
- **User Interaction Required:** The attack requires the user to visit the attacker-controlled website. Attackers convince users via links in emails or instant messages or by getting them to open attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** Attackers need to be able to host malicious HTML content either on their own server or on a compromised website.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to be able to trick the user to visit the malicious site.
