{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ASUS RT-N10E Wireless Router has an authentication bypass vulnerability that allows unauthenticated access to the device's configuration page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication Bypass (CWE-592). The router does not require authentication to access the  `/qis/QIS_finish.htm` page, which displays the device's configuration, including the administrator password.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can retrieve the device's administrator password without any authentication, gaining full access to the device's configuration page.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to have network access to the device (specifically LAN access).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable ASUS router."
