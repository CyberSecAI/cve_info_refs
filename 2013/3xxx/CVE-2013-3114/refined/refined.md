        "root_cause": "Improper memory access in Internet Explorer. When Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Memory corruption due to improper object handling"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system if the current user has administrative rights. This could lead to installation of programs, data manipulation, or creation of new accounts with full user rights.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "A user visiting a specially crafted website",
          "A user opening a malicious file via email or instant messaging"

        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a specially crafted website or send a malicious file to the victim. The attacker also needs to convince the user to visit the website or open the file. No user interaction is necessary other than visiting the malicious website."
