- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Samsung Web Viewer for Samsung DVR has a flaw in its cookie-handling process. It accepts any input as a valid session ID if it is placed after `SessionID=`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication Bypass by Assumed-Immutable Data (CWE-302). The application improperly validates session IDs from cookies, leading to an authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to internal pages, which include camera controls and account settings. They can potentially retrieve the device's administrator password, granting them complete access to the device's configuration web page or system password configuration files.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted cookie containing a malicious SessionID to the web server. The example given uses headers with a "Cookie" value of "=" and the "Accept" value of "text/plain".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device, therefore a network connection to the device is required. No prior authentication is needed.
