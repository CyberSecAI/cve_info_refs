Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3369:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from RT (Request Tracker) allowing the calling of arbitrary Mason components, without control over arguments, for users who have access to administration pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Component Access:** The vulnerability allows calling of private components, which should not be directly accessible to users, especially without proper control over arguments. This can lead to exploitation of those components if they handle user-controlled input insecurely.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Component Execution:** A malicious user could execute private components, which may result in unintended or negative side effects.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** If the executed private components are flawed and process user-provided arguments, it could lead to a broader attack, potentially code execution depending on the component's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of RT by users with access to administration pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **User Account with Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have a user account that can access the RT administration pages to exploit this vulnerability.
