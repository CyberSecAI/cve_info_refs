Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component, which falls under the CWE-74 category. This means the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a manner that can be interpreted as code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into a file. This is achieved by manipulating the `leftFileName` parameter in the `saveCompareConfig.php` script.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability is located in `hpdiags/frontend2/commands/saveCompareConfig.php`. The `leftFileName` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting PHP code, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is performed remotely over the network via HTTP/HTTPS requests.
*   **Manipulated Parameters:** The attack vector involves manipulating the parameters of the `saveCompareConfig.php` script, specifically the `leftFileName`, `devicePath` and others to inject malicious code into a file that is saved on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the HP Insight Diagnostics application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server running the vulnerable HP Insight Diagnostics application.
