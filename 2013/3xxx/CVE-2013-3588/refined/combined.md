## Zyxel P660 series modem/router denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#893726

Original Release Date: 2014-04-01 | Last Revised: 2014-04-01

---

### Overview

Zyxel P660 series modem/router contains a denial of service vulnerability when parsing a high volume of SYN packets on the web management interface.

### Description

| It has been reported that Zyxel P660 series modem/router (and possibly other models which share the same core firmware) fail to parse a high volume of SYN packets on the web management interface correctly causing the device to reboot. By default, the device runs a web management interface on port tcp/80 which is accessible remotely (LAN and WAN sides). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker can cause the device to reboot and become unavailable by sending a stream of SYN packets to the device's web management interface. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Network Access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks if possible. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from connecting to the service from a blocked network location. |
