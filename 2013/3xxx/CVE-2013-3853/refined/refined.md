Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3853:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
-  The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue that occurs when Microsoft Office software, specifically Word, improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Memory corruption: Improper handling of objects in memory during the parsing of crafted files can corrupt memory.
-  Remote Code Execution: The memory corruption can be exploited by an attacker to achieve remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Remote Code Execution: An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
-  Complete System Control: If the user has administrative privileges, an attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
-  Malicious Activities: This control allows the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Specially Crafted Files: Exploitation requires the user to open a specially crafted document file (.doc) using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Word.
-  Email Attachments: An attacker could send a crafted document via email and convince the user to open it.
-  Web-based Attacks: An attacker could host a malicious website containing the crafted file and entice the user to visit the site and open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  Crafting a malicious document: The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Microsoft Word document that triggers the vulnerability.
-  Social Engineering/Deception: The attacker must convince the user to open the malicious file, which could involve social engineering tactics.
-  No direct network access is needed since the vulnerability is triggered by the user opening a file.

-   The vulnerability is specific to the msptls component of Microsoft Office.
-   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" in severity.
-   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Microsoft Office including Microsoft Office 2007 SP3, specifically the `msptls` component.
-   Updates for this vulnerability were released in September 2013, and users should apply them to prevent exploitation.
-   Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure, meaning it was not publicly known before the security bulletin release.
-   Microsoft stated that at the time of the bulletin's original release, no reports had been received that this vulnerability had been publicly exploited.
