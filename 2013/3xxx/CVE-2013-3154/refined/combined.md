# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Windows Defender for Windows 7 and Windows Defender when installed on Windows Server 2008 R2. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege due to the pathnames used by Windows Defender. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. The attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.

This security update is rated Important for Windows Defender for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting pathnames used by Windows Defender. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

## Update FAQ

**What is Windows Defender?**

In Windows 7, Windows Defender is a free antispyware software. It helps protect a userâs computer against malware. Windows Defender is installed by default in Windows 7.

**Where can I find more information about Microsoft antimalware technology?**

For more information, visit the [Microsoft Malware Protection Center](https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/) website.

**I am running Windows 7 but I have Windows Defender disabled. Do need to install this update?**

No. If Windows Defender is disabled, you do not need to install this update. However, because Windows Defender is included as a component of Windows 7, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**How can** **Windows Defender** **be** **installed on systems running Windows Server 2008 R2?**

Windows Defender is included with the Desktop Experience feature for Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see [Desktop Experience Overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc772567).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

For more information, see [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc998259).

| Software | Microsoft Windows 7 Defender Improper Pathname Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3154 | Aggregate Severity Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Defender for Windows 7 (x86) | **Important**  Elevation of Privilege | **Important** |
| Windows Defender for Windows 7 (x64) | **Important**  Elevation of Privilege | **Important** |
| Windows Defender when installed on Windows Server 2008 R2 (x64) | **Important**  Elevation of Privilege | **Important** |

## Microsoft Windows 7 Defender Improper Pathname Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3154

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3154](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3154).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.
* In a Windows 7 default configuration, a user running as a standard user account does not have permissions to write files to the root directory on the system. This mitigates the vulnerability because, in a default configuration, a standard user account would not have the necessary permissions to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by the improper use of pathnames when attempting to load an affected version of the Windows Defender service.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem account and take complete control of the system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

An attacker must have valid logon credentials to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited by anonymous users.

**What is the LocalSystem account?**

The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has extensive privileges on the local computer, and acts as the computer on the network. Its token includes the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators SIDs; these accounts have access to most system objects. A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account inherits the security context of the Service Control Manager. Most services do not need such a high privilege level. For more information, see the MSDN article, [LocalSystem Account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms684190.aspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then place a specially crafted application in a location that could be used to exploit the vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Windows 7 workstations are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting pathnames used by Windows Defender for Windows 7.

**When this security** **advisory** **was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security** **advisory** **was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security advisory was originally issued.

## Transcript

### **Michele Bullock**, Governor (2023 – Present)

Our job here at the Reserve Bank is to serve the community. The Parliament of Australia has given the
Reserve Bank some very important responsibilities. It is our duty to promote the economic prosperity and
welfare of the people of Australia, both now and into the future. We do this in many ways, including by
setting monetary policy to maintain price stability and full employment, by contributing to the
efficiency and stability of the payments system and the stability of the financial system, and by banking
the Australian Government and providing the nation’s banknotes.

Probably the thing we do that is most familiar to people is set the level of interest rates. This is known
as ‘monetary policy’, where we change interest rates to try to smooth fluctuations in the
economy. The interest rate we control is the cash rate, which is the rate that banks charge each other to
borrow overnight. Now this interest rate influences other interest rates in the economy, such as those
charged on your loans, or those you earn on your savings. Changes in interest rates influence
people’s decisions to buy things or invest money, and they affect the exchange rate and the value of
any assets that people might hold, such as homes or shares. All this affects economic activity. In
deciding where to set the cash rate, we want to keep inflation low and stable, averaging
2-3 per cent – our inflation ‘target’, if you like. But we want to do it in a
way that keeps the level of employment as high as possible. These outcomes are essential for a prosperous
economy.

But there are many other things that we are responsible for as well.

The Reserve Bank’s also responsible for the stability of the financial system. We typically think of
a stable financial system as one that is safe and helps money flow within the economy, even when there
are disruptive events. We contribute to financial stability in a number of ways. One important way is by
setting monetary policy that helps keep inflation low and stable and people fully employed. We also
collaborate with other financial regulators – Australian Prudential Regulation Authority,
Australian Securities and Investment Commission and the Australian Treasury – through the Council
of Financial Regulators to identify risks in the financial system and to develop plans to address them if
they arise. In extreme situations, we can also provide lending to financial institutions that are sound
but experiencing difficulties with liquidity.

Now we also make and distribute Australia’s banknotes. We have some of the highest quality and most
secure banknotes in the world and they use technology that we in Australia invented, the Bank invented it with the CSIRO in the 1980s –
polymer, or if you like, plastic banknotes. We have a purpose-built banknote printing facility and vault
in the outer suburbs of Melbourne. It might surprise many people that despite the use of electronic
payments increasing, there is still a lot of demand for banknotes, particularly as a store of value.

We also operate the payment system that is at the centre of the movement of money in Australia. When money
goes from one bank to another, say when you pay a bill to somebody who banks with a different bank, the
money comes through the Reserve Bank. We are also constantly looking at innovations to provide
Australians with the most efficient and secure ways to pay. For example, we worked with the banks to
develop the New Payments Platform, which allows people to make payments in close to real time,
24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And we are looking at how the nature of money and the payments
system could evolve as technology changes.

We are the banker for the Australian Government. So, when you get a Medicare refund, pay your tax or
receive a refund, those transactions occur through the government’s bank accounts here at the
Reserve Bank. It’s the same if you’ve ever needed a disaster relief or other support payment,
perhaps during the COVID-19 pandemic, floods or bushfires. We know that many
people rely on these payments, and we feel privileged to partner with the government in getting these
vital payments to you quickly and reliably.

A lot of research, analysis, innovation and support is required to deliver all of these functions. We do
all this with a bit over 1,500 people. Most of us are located here in Sydney. But we have a banking
branch in Canberra and offices in Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Beijing, London and New York.

We’re the nation’s central bank and we take our responsibilities to the Australian people very
seriously.
