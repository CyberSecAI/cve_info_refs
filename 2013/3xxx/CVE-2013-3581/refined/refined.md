The content is related to CVE-2013-3581.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Choice Wireless Green Packet 4G WiMax modem (model WIXFMR-111) has a web interface that doesn't properly authenticate AJAX requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper authentication for AJAX requests in the web interface.
- Web interface is exposed on both LAN and WAN sides.
- Allows for the retrieval of sensitive system configuration information via unauthenticated AJAX requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can view system configuration information.
- Possible execution of commands on the device.
- Exposure of sensitive information, such as WiMax configuration, username, and password in plain text.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted AJAX requests to the modem's web interface via HTTP on both LAN and WAN.
- The specific vulnerable endpoints are: `/ajax.cgi?action=wmxState`, `/ajax.cgi?action=netState`, and `/ajax.cgi?action=tag_ipPing&pip=1+%26%26+cat+%2Fetc%2Fsncfg%2Fwmx.cfg`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to reach the device's web interface on either the LAN or WAN side.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
