## SearchBlox contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#592942

Original Release Date: 2013-08-23 | Last Revised: 2013-08-23

---

### Overview

SearchBlox contains multiple vulnerabilities that can allow an unauthenticated attacker to overwrite critical data on the filesystem, read cleartext user credentials, or execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| SearchBlox versions 7.4 Build 1 and older contain multiple vulnerabilities that allow an unauthenticated attacker to compromise the integrity of the system and the confidentiality of its data. Specifically:  [**CWE-77**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)**: Command Injection** - CVE-2013-3590Active content, such as JSP pages, can be uploaded to <http://HOSTNAME:8080/searchblox/admin/uploadImage.html>. This can be done by submitting the content using the form and using a client proxy to ensure that the "Content-Type" for the uploaded file is "image/jpeg". The attacker can then visit the uploaded content and enable its execution.[**CWE-200**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)**: Information Exposure** - CVE-2013-3597Usernames and passwords can be read from the database by visiting <http://HOSTNAME:8080/searchblox/servlet/CollectionListServlet?action=getList&orderBy=colName&direction=asc>[**CWE-73**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/73.html)**: External Control of File Name or Path** - CVE-2013-3598Filesystem data can be remotely overwritten by sending an HTTP POST request to /searchblox/servlet/CreateTemplateServlet and modifying the "name" parameter to point to an arbitrary system file, such as "../../../../../etc/shadow".The CVSS scores reflect the command injection attack. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker could compromise the confidentiality of the system's data, perform arbitrary code execution, overwrite data on the filesystem with the application's privileges, and compromise the availability of the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**These issues are addressed in version 7.5 build 1 or later. |

People use the phrase âdigital transformationâ to cover all sorts of

progressive corporate behaviors, but what it comes down to is being more

efficient, data driven and nimble. That kind of transformation isnât possible

unless you enable content access, dismantling information silos in the

process. In other words, digital transformation starts with search.
