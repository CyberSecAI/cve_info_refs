{
  "CVE-2013-3709": {
    "description": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that WebYaST was initially installed with world-readable secret tokens. Although these tokens were modified upon the start of the webyast service, making them unreadable remotely, local attackers could still read these secrets from the same machine. This allowed them to forge session cookies and gain local root access via the webyast service.",
    "root_cause": "The secret token file (secret_token.rb) was initially created with world-readable permissions, allowing local users to access it.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure file permissions",
      "Session cookie forgery",
      "Local privilege escalation"
    ],
    "impact": "Local attackers could gain root access by forging session cookies.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the server where WebYaST is installed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have local access to the machine where WebYaST is running and be able to read the secret_token.rb file."
