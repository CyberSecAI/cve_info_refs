  "CVE-2013-3587": {
    "description": "The vulnerability known as BREACH (Browser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext) allows an attacker to recover secrets from HTTPS responses by observing the length of compressed responses when attacker-controlled input is reflected in the response body. This is due to the nature of HTTP-level compression algorithms making the size of the response dependent on the input data.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Web applications using HTTP compression",
	  "TLS/SSL"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause lies in how HTTP compression algorithms reduce the size of responses based on the data that is being compressed, combined with the fact that user-controlled data can be reflected in the response body. This allows an attacker to infer the content of the response body based on the compressed size of the response.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information leakage through compression side-channel",
      "Exposure of secrets in HTTP responses",
      "Vulnerability to chosen-plaintext attacks on compressed data"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to the leakage of sensitive information such as CSRF tokens, session IDs, PII and other secrets embedded in the HTML responses. This can allow attackers to bypass security mechanisms, escalate privileges, or gain unauthorized access to user accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks",
      "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) manipulation",
      "Malicious website",
	  "Eavesdropping on network traffic"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to inject content into HTTP requests",
      "Ability to measure the size of HTTPS responses"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The attack is agnostic to the version of TLS/SSL, and does not require TLS-layer compression. Additionally, the attack works against any cipher suite. Against a stream cipher, the attack is simpler; the difference in sizes across response bodies is much more granular in this case. If a block cipher is used, additional work must be done to align the output to the cipher text blocks.\n\nThe vulnerability is present when web applications:\n\n*   Are served from a server that uses HTTP-level compression\n*   Reflect user-input in HTTP response bodies\n*   Reflect a secret (such as a CSRF token) in HTTP response bodies\n\nAdditionally, the attack is helped by responses that remain mostly the same, as that makes the difference in size, which the attacker measures, more precise."
