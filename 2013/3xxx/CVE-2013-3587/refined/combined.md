## [A Practical Attack against MDM Solutions](#Brodie)

Spyphones are surveillance tools surreptitiously planted on a users handheld device. While malicious mobile applications mainly phone fraud applications distributed through common application channels - target the typical consumer, spyphones are nation states tool of attacks. Why? Once installed, the software stealthy gathers information such as text messages (SMS), geo-location information, emails and even surround-recordings.

How are these mobile cyber-espionage attacks carried out? In this engaging session, we present a novel proof-of-concept attack technique which bypass traditional mobile malware detection measures- and even circumvent common Mobile Device Management (MDM) features, such as encryption.

## [A Tale of One Software Bypass of Windows 8 Secure Boot](#Bulygin)

Windows 8 Secure Boot based on UEFI 2.3.1 Secure Boot is an important step towards securing platforms from malware compromising boot sequence before the OS. However, there are certain mistakes platform vendors shouldn't make which can completely undermine protections offered by Secure Boot. We will demonstrate an example of full software bypass of Windows 8 Secure Boot due to such mistakes on some of the latest platforms and explain how those mistakes can be avoided.

## [Above My Pay Grade: Cyber Response at the National Level](#Healey)

Incident response is usually a deeply technical forensic investigation and mitigation for an individual organization. But for incidents that are not merely cyber crime but truly national security events, such as large-scale disruptive attacks that could be acts of war by another nation, the process is completely dissimilar, needing a different kind of thinking.

This talk will discuss exactly how, detailing the flow of national security incident response in the United States using the scenario of a major attack on the finance sector. The response starts at individual banks and exchanges, through the public-private sector information sharing processes (like FS-ISAC). Treasury handles the financial side of the crisis while DHS tackles the technical. If needed, the incident can be escalated to the military and president especially if the incident becomes especially disruptive or destructive. The talk examines this flow and the actions and decisions within the national security apparatus, concluding with the pros and cons of this approach and comparing it to the process in other key countries.

## [Android: one root to own them all](#Forristal)

This presentation is a case study showcasing the technical details of Android security bug 8219321, disclosed to Google in February 2013. The vulnerability involves discrepancies in how Android applications are cryptographically verified & installed, allowing for APK code modification without breaking the cryptographic signature; that in turn is a simple step away from system access & control. The vulnerability affects a wide number of Android devices, across generations & architectures, with little to no modifications of the exploit. The presentation will review how the vulnerability was located, how an exploit was created, and why the exploit works, giving you insight into the vulnerability problem and the exploitation process. Working PoCs for major Android device vendors will be made available to coincide with the presentation.

## [BinaryPig - Scalable Malware Analytics in Hadoop](#Hanif)

Over the past 2.5 years Endgame received 20M samples of malware equating to roughly 9.5 TB of binary data. In this, weâre not alone. McAfee reports that it currently receives roughly 100,000 malware samples per day and received roughly 10M samples in the last quarter of 2012 [1]. Its total corpus is estimated to be about 100M samples. VirusTotal receives between 300k and 600k unique files per day, and of those roughly one-third to half are positively identified as malware [2].

This huge volume of malware offers both challenges and opportunities for security research especially applied machine learning. Endgame performs static analysis on malware in order to extract feature sets used for performing large-scale machine learning. Since malware research has traditionally been the domain of reverse engineers, most existing malware analysis tools were designed to process single binaries or multiple binaries on a single computer and are unprepared to confront terabytes of malware simultaneously. There is no easy way for security researchers to apply static analysis techniques at scale; companies and individuals that want to pursue this path are forced to create their own solutions.

Our early attempts to process this data did not scale well with the increasing flood of samples. As the size of our malware collection increased, the system became unwieldy and hard to manage, especially in the face of hardware failures. Over the past two years we refined this system into a dedicated framework based on Hadoop so that our large-scale studies are easier to perform and are more repeatable over an expanding dataset.

To address this problem, we will present our open framework, BinaryPig, as well as some example uses of this technology to perform a multiyear, multi-terabyte, multimillion-sample malware census. This framework is built over Apache Hadoop, Apache Pig, and Python. It addresses many issues of scalable malware processing, including dealing with increasingly large data sizes, improving workflow development speed, and enabling parallel processing of binary files with most pre-existing tools. It is also modular and extensible, in the hope that it will aid security researchers and academics in handling ever-larger amounts of malware.

In addition, we will demonstrate the results of our exploration and the techniques used to derive these results. The framework, analysis modules, and some example applications will be released as open source (Apache 2.0 License) at Blackhat.

## [BIOS Security](#Butterworth)

In 2011 the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) released a draft of special publication 800-155. This document provides a more detailed description than the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) PC client specification for content that should be measured in the BIOS to provide an adequate Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM). To justify the importance of 800-155, in this talk we look at the implementation of the SRTM from a vendor's pre-800-155 laptop. We discuss how the BIOS and thus SRTM can be manipulated either due to a configuration that does not enable signed BIOS updates, or via an exploit we discovered that allows for BIOS reflash even in the presence of a signed update requirement.

We also show how a 51 byte patch to the SRTM can cause it to provide a forged measurement to the TPM indicating that the BIOS is pristine. If a TPM Quote is used to query the boot state of the system, this TPM-signed falsification will then serve as the root of misplaced trust. We also show how reflashing the BIOS may not necessarily remove this trust-subverting malware. To fix the un-trustworthy SRTM we apply an academic technique whereby the BIOS software indicates its integrity through a timing side-channel.

## [Black-Box Assessment of Pseudorandom Algorithms](#Soeder)

Last year at Black Hat, Argyros and Kiayias devastated all things pseudorandom in open-source PHP applications. This year, we're bringing PRNG attacks to the masses.

We'll point out flaws in many of the most common non-cryptographic pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) and examine how to identify a PRNG based on a black-box analysis of application output. In many cases, most or all of the PRNG's internal state can be recovered, enabling determination of past output and prediction of future output. We'll present algorithms that run many orders of magnitude faster than a brute-force search, including reversing and seeking the PRNG stream in constant time. Finally, of course, we'll demonstrate everything and give away our tool so that you can perform the attacks during your own assessments.

## [BlackBerryOS 10 from a security perspective](#Weinmann)

BlackBerry prides itself with being a strong contender in the field of secure mobile platforms. While traditionally BlackBerryOS was based on a proprietary RTOS with a JVM propped on top, the architecture was completely overhauled with BlackBerryOS 10. Now the base operating system is the formerly off-the-shelf RTOS QNX, which doesn't exactly have an excellent security track record. Moreover, for the first time in BBOS history, native code applications are allowed on the platform.

This talk will present an analysis of the attack surface of BBOS 10, considering both ways to escalate privileges locally and routes for remote entry. Moreover, since exploitation is only half the work of offense, we'll show ways for rootkits to persist on the device. Last but not least we will settle whether BlackBerry Balance really holds what it promises: are mobile devices really ready to securely separate crucial business data from Angry Birds?

## [Bluetooth Smart: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, and The Fix!](#Ryan)

Bluetooth Smart, AKA Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE), is a new modulation mode and link-layer packet format defined in Bluetooth 4.0. A new class of low-power devices and high-end smartphones are already on the market using this protocol. Applications include everything from fitness devices to wireless door locks. The Good: Bluetooth Smart is well-designed and good at what it does. We explain its workings from the PHY layer (raw RF) all the way to the application layer. The Bad: Bluetooth Smart's key exchange is weak. We will perform a live demonstration of sniffing and recovering encryption keys using open source tools we developed. The Ugly: A passive eavesdropper can decrypt all communications with a sniffed encryption key using our tools. The Fix: We implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman to exchange a key in-band. This backward-compatible fix renders the protocol secure against passive eavesdroppers.

## [Bochspwn: Identifying 0-days via System-wide Memory Access Pattern Analysis](#Jurczyk)

Throughout the last two decades, the field of automated vulnerability discovery has evolved into the advanced state we have today: effective dynamic analysis is achieved with a plethora of complex, privately developed fuzzers dedicated to specific products, file formats or protocols, with source code and binary-level static analysis slowly catching up, yet already proving useful in specific scenarios. Due to market demand and general ease of access, the efforts have been primarily focused around client software, effectively limiting kernel code coverage to a few generic syscall and IOCTL fuzzers. Considering the current impact of ring-0 security on the overall system security posture and number of kernel-specific bug classes, we would like to propose a novel, dynamic approach to locating subtle kernel security flaws that would likely otherwise remain unnoticed for years.

The presentation will introduce the concept of identifying vulnerabilities in operating systemsâ kernels by employing dynamic CPU-level instrumentation over a live system session, on the example of using memory access patterns to extract information about potential race conditions in interacting with user-mode memory. We will discuss several different ways to implement the idea, with special emphasis on the âBochspwnâ project we developed last year and successfully used to discover around 50 local elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel so far, with many of them already addressed in the ms13-016, ms13-017, ms13-031 and ms13-036 security bulletins. The tool itself will be open-sourced during the conference, thus allowing a wider audience to test and further develop the approach.

## [Bugalyze.com - Detecting Bugs Using Decompilation and Data Flow Analysis](#Cesare)

Bugwise is a free online web service at www.bugalyze.com to perform static analysis of binary executables to detect software bugs and vulnerabilities. It detects bugs using a combination of decompilation to recover high level information, and data flow analysis to discover issues such as use-after-frees and double frees. Bugwise has been developed over the past several years and is implemented as a series of modules in a greater system that performs other binary analysis tasks such as malware detection. This entire system consists of more than 100,000 lines of C++ code and a scalable load balanced multi-node Amazon EC2 cluster. In this talk, I will explain how Bugwise works. The system is still in the development stage but has successfully found a number of real bugs and vulnerabilities in Debian Linux. This includes double free, use-after-free, and over 50 getenv(,strcpy) bugs statically found from scanning the entire Debian repository.

## [Buying into the Bias: Why Vulnerability Statistics Suck](#Martin)

Academic researchers, journalists, security vendors, software vendors, and other enterprising... uh... enterprises often analyze vulnerability statistics using large repositories of vulnerability data, such as CVE, OSVDB, and others. These stats are claimed to demonstrate trends in disclosure, such as the number or type of vulnerabilities, or their relative severity. Worse, they are often (mis)used to compare competing products to assess which one offers the best security.

Most of these statistical analyses are faulty or just pure hogwash. They use the easily-available, but drastically misunderstood data to craft irrelevant questions based on wild assumptions, while never figuring out (or even asking us about) the limitations of the data. This leads to a wide variety of bias that typically goes unchallenged, that ultimately forms statistics that make headlines and, far worse, are used for budget and spending.

As maintainers of two well-known vulnerability information repositories, we're sick of hearing about sloppy research after it's been released, and we're not going to take it any more.

We will give concrete examples of the misuses and abuses of vulnerability statistics over the years, revealing which studies do it right (rather, the least wrong), and how to judge future claims so that you can make better decisions based on these "studies." We will cover all the kinds of documented and undocumented bias that can exist in a vulnerability data source; how variations in counting hurt comparative analyses; and all the ways that vulnerability information is observed, cataloged, and annotated.

Steve will provide vendor-neutral, friendly, supportive suggestions to the industry. Jericho will do no such thing.

## [Combating the Insider Threat at the FBI: Real World Lessons Learned](#Reidy)

What do T.S. Eliot, Puxatony Phil, eugenics, DLP, crowdsourcing, black swans, and narcissism have in common? They are all key concepts for an effective insider threat program. Come hear how the FBI uses a surprising variety of methods to combat insiders. In this session the FBI will provide five key lessons learned about effective detection and deterrence techniques used in the FBI's insider threat program developed over the last decade. The talk will provide insight on how our nation's premier law enforcement agency is detecting and deterring insider threat using a variety of techniques and technologies. This session will provide unique lessons learned from building a real world, operational insider threat monitoring and response program.

## [Compromising Industrial Facilities From 40 Miles Away](#Apa)

The evolution of wireless technologies has allowed industrial automation and control systems (IACS) to become strategic assets for companies that rely on processing plants and facilities in industries such as energy production, oil, gas, water, utilities, refining, and petrochemical distribution and processing. Effective wireless sensor networks have enabled these companies to reduce implementation, maintenance, and equipment costs and enhance personal safety by enabling new topologies for remote monitoring and administration in hazardous locations.

However, the manner in which sensor networks handle and control cryptographic keys is very different from the way in which they are handled in traditional business networks. Sensor networks involve large numbers of sensor nodes with limited hardware capabilities, so the distribution and revocation of keys is not a trivial task.

In this presentation, we review the most commonly implemented key distribution schemes, their weaknesses, and how vendors can more effectively align their designs with key distribution solutions. We also demonstrate some attacks that exploit key distribution vulnerabilities, which we recently discovered in every wireless device developed over the past few years by three leading industrial wireless automation solution providers. These devices are widely used by many energy, oil, water, nuclear, natural gas, and refined petroleum companies.

An untrusted user or group within a 40-mile range could read from and inject data into these devices using radio frequency (RF) transceivers. A remotely and wirelessly exploitable memory corruption bug could disable all the sensor nodes and forever shut down an entire facility. When sensors and transmitters are attacked, remote sensor measurements on which critical decisions are made can be modified. This can lead to unexpected, harmful, and dangerous consequences.

## [CreepyDOL: Cheap, Distributed Stalking](#OConnor)

Are you a person with a few hundred dollars and an insatiable curiosity about your neighbors, who is fed up with the hard work of tracking your target's every move in person? Good news! You, too, can learn the intimate secrets and continuous physical location of an entire city from the comfort of your desk! CreepyDOL is a distributed sensing and data mining system combining very-low-cost sensors, open-source software, and a focus on user experience to provide personnel identification, tracking, and analysis without sending any data to the targets. In other words, it takes you from hand-crafted, artisan skeeviness to big-box commodity creepiness, and enables government-level total awareness for about $500 of off-the-shelf hardware.

## [Defending Networks with Incomplete Information: A Machine Learning Approach](#Pinto)

Let's face it: we may win some battles, but we are losing the war pretty badly. Regardless of the advances in malware and targeted attacks detection technologies, our top security practitioners can only do so much in a 24-hour day; even less, if you let them eat and sleep. On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of capable people to do "simple" security monitoring effectively, let alone complex incident detection and response.

Enter the use of Machine Learning as a way to automatically prioritize and classify potential events and attacks as something could potentially be blocked automatically, is clearly benign, or is really worth the time of your analyst.

On this presentation we will present publicly for the first time an actual implementation of those concepts, in the form of a free-to-use web service. It leverages OSINT and knowledge about the spatial distribution of the Internet to generate a fluid and constantly updated classifier that pinpoints areas of interest on submitted network traffic logs.

## [Dissecting CSRF Attacks & Countermeasures](#Shema)

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) remains a significant threat to web apps and user data. Current countermeasures like request nonces can be cumbersome to deploy correctly and difficult to apply to a site retroactively. Detecting these vulns with automated tools can be equally difficult to do accurately.

The presentation starts with a demonstration of how to model attacks to validate whether different kinds of countermeasures are implemented correctly. It includes a tool and code to show how to detect these vulns with few false positives.

Then we explore how CSRF could be prevented at the HTTP layer by proposing a new header-based policy, similar to the intent of Content Security Policy. This new policy introduces a concept called Storage Origin Security (SOS) for cookies and session objects that foils many kinds of CSRF attacks without burdening the site with HTML modifications. The solution focuses on simplicity to make it easier to retrofit on current apps, but requires browsers to support a new client-side security control. We show how this trade-off could be a quicker way to improving security on the web.

## [End-to-End Analysis of a Domain Generating Algorithm Malware Family](#Geffner1)

Select malware families have used Domain Generating Algorithms (DGAs) over the past few years in an effort to evade traditional domain blacklists, allow for fast-flux domain registration and usage, and evade analystsâ abilities to predict attackersâ control servers. While novel work has been done by both private industry and academia with respect to detecting DGA-related network traffic, this presentation demonstrates end-to-end analysis of a DGA malware family, from binary deobfuscation to DGA analysis, to sinkholing, to domain registrant research, to attribution of the malwareâs author and accomplices.

The malware family discussed in this presentation has thousands of active variants currently running on the Internet and has managed to stay off of the radar of all antivirus firms. This presentation will bring to light how this malware is tied to an underground campaign that has been active for at least the past six years.

## [Energy Fraud and Orchestrated Blackouts: Issues with Wireless Metering Protocols (wM-Bus)](#Brunschwiler)

Government requirements, new business cases, and consumer behavioral changes drive energy market players to improve the overall management of energy infrastructures.

While the energy infrastructure is steadily maintained and improved, some significant changes have been introduced to the power grids of late. Actually, the significance of the changes could be compared to the early days of the Internet where computers started to become largely interconnected. Naturally, questions arise whether a grid composed of so many interacting components can still meet today's requirements for reliability, availability, and privacy.

Nations absolutely recognize the criticality of the energy infrastructure for their economic and political stability. Therefore, various initiatives to ensure reliability and availability of their energy infrastructures are being driven at nation as well as at nation union levels. In order to contribute to the evaluation of national cyber security risks, the author decided to conduct a security analysis in the field of smart energy.

Utilities have started to introduce new field device technology - smart meters. As the name implies, smart meters do support many more use cases than any old conventional electricity meter did. Not only does the new generation of meters support fine granular remote data reading, but it also facilitates remote load control or remote software updates. Hence, to build a secure advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), communication protocols must support bi-directional data transmission and protect meter data and control commands in transit.

Therefore, analysis of smart metering protocols is of great interest. The work presented has analyzed the security of the Meter Bus (M-Bus) as specified within the relevant standards. The M-Bus is very popular in remote meter reading and has its roots in the heat metering industries. It has continuously been adopted to fit more complex applications during the past twenty years. According to a workshop note, an estimated 15 million devices were relying on the wireless version of M-Bus in 2010. It was analyzed whether smart meters using wireless M-Bus do fit the overall security and reliability needs of the grid or whether such devices might threaten the infrastructure.

The M-Bus standard has been analyzed whether it provides effective security mechanisms. It can be stated that wireless M-Bus seems to be robust against deduction of consumption behaviour from the wireless network traffic. For this reason, it is considered privacy-preserving against network traffic analysis. Unfortunately, vulnerabilities have been identified that render that fact obsolete. The findings are mainly related to confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

Consequently, smart meters relying on wireless M-Bus and supporting remote disconnects are prone to become subject to an orchestrated remote disconnect which poses a severe risk to the grid. Further issues may lead to zero consumption detection, disclosure of consumption values, and disclosure of encryption keys.

Following that, the availability and reliability of the smart grid or at least parts of it may not be guaranteed.

## [Exploiting Network Surveillance Cameras Like a Hollywood Hacker](#Heffner)

This talk will examine 0-day vulnerabilities that can be trivially exploited by remote attackers to gain administrative and root-level access to consumer and enterprise network surveillance cameras manufactured by D-Link, Trendnet, Cisco, IQInvision, Alinking and 3SVision. Thousands of these cameras are Internet accessible, and known to be deployed in homes, businesses, hotels, casinos, banks and prisons, as well as military and industrial facilities.

Additionally, a proof-of-concept attack will be demonstrated in which a remote attacker can leverage the described vulnerabilities to freeze and modify legitimate video streams from these cameras, in true Hollywood fashion.

## [Evading deep inspection for fun and shell](#Niemi)

Whether you have a Next Generation Firewall, an IPS, IDS, or a BDS, the security provided by these devices depends on their capability to perform robust TCP/IP reassembly. If this fails, the device can be bypassed. We researched the TCP/IP reassembly capabilities of security boxes and found that their detection can be evaded or pierced through with evasions that apply to the IP & TCP layers. The TCP reassembly capabilities of most security boxes are still poor. Instead of doing proper TCP reassembly, many of the analyzed boxes try to prevent attacks by anomaly detection, for example, by blocking small TCP segments. However, blocking small segments leads to false positives, so this kind of blocking strategy cannot be applied to real traffic without the false positive risk. We also found evasions that allowed the attack to succeed without any logs in the security box, even if all signatures were set to block.

## [The Factoring Dead: Preparing for the Cryptopocalypse](#Stamos)

The last several years has seen an explosion of practical exploitation of widespread cryptographic weaknesses, such as BEAST, CRIME, Lucky 13 and the RC4 bias vulnerabilities. The invention of these techniques requires a lot of hard work, deep knowledge and the ability to generate a pithy acronym, but rarely involves the use of a completely unknown weakness. Cryptography researchers have known about the existence of compression oracles, RC4 biases and problems with CBC mode for years, but the general information security community has been unaware of these dangers until fully working exploits were demonstrated.

In this talk, the speakers will explain the latest breakthroughs in the academic crypto community and look ahead at what practical issues could arise for popular cryptosystems. Specifically, we will focus on the latest breakthroughs in discrete mathematics and their potential ability to undermine our trust in the most basic asymmetric primitives, including RSA. We will explain the basic theories behind RSA and the state-of-the-art in large numbering factoring, and how several recent papers may point the way to massive improvements in this area.

The talk will then switch to the practical aspects of the doomsday scenario, and will answer the question "What happens the day after RSA is broken?" We will point out the many obvious and hidden uses of RSA and related algorithms and outline how software engineers and security teams can operate in a post-RSA world. We will also discuss the results of our survey of popular products and software, and point out the ways in which individuals can prepare for the zombi^H^H^H crypto apocalypse.

## [Fact and Fiction: Defending your Medical Devices](#Radcliffe)

In the past 18 months we have seen a dramatic increase in research and presentations on the security of medical devices. While this brought much needed attention to the issue, it has also uncovered a great deal of misinformation. This talk is going to tackle those confusing and controversial topics. Whatâs the reality of patching a medical device? Is it safe to run anti-virus protection on them? Youâll find out in this talk. This presentation will outline a framework on how vendors, buyers, and administrators of medical devices can bring substantive changes in the security of these devices. This talk will also have the unique element of discussing a medical device software bug that InGuardians uncovered. This bug will be discussed in detail and replicated live on stage. InGuardians has worked closely with the FDA on properly documenting and submitting this through their tracking system. This will be covered in full detail so other researchers will know how to properly disclose bugs and vulnerabilities.

## [Fully Arbitrary 802.3 Packet Injection: Maximizing the Ethernet Attack Surface](#Barisani)

It is generally assumed that crafting arbitrary, and sniffing, Fast Ethernet packets can be performed with standard Network Interface Cards (NIC) and generally available packet injection software. However, full control of frame values such as the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) or Start-of-Frame delimiter (SFD) have historically required the use of dedicated and costly hardware. Our presentation will dissect Fast Ethernet layer 1 & 2 presenting novel attack techniques supported by an affordable hardware setup with customized firmware which will be publicly released.

This research expands the ability to test and analyse the full attack surface of networked embedded systems, with particular attention on automation, automotive and avionics industries. Application of attacks against NICs with hard and soft Media Access Control (MAC) on industrial embedded systems will be explored.

We will illustrate how specific frame manipulations can trigger SFD parsing anomalies and Ethernet Packet-In-Packet injection. These results are analyzed in relation to their security relevance and scenarios of application. Finally, conditions for a successful remote Ethernet Packet-In-Packet injection will be discussed and demonstrated for what is believed to be the first time in public.

## [Funderbolt: Adventures in Thunderbolt DMA Attacks](#Sevinsky)

Intel's Thunderbolt allows for high-speed data transfers for a variety of peripherals including high-resolution high-bandwidth graphics displays, all using the same physical connection. This convenience comes at a bit of a cost: an external port into your computer's bus and possibly memory! Thunderbolt ports appear on high-end laptops like the MacBook Pro, but also increasingly on PC hardware, and on newer desktop and server motherboards. This proprietary technology is undocumented but problems with it could potentially undermine the privacy and security of users.

This talk chronicles process of exploring these risks through a practical exercise in reverse engineering. Experience the tribulations with reversing Thunderbolt chips, understand the attack strategies for exploiting DMA and see the pitfalls one encounters along the way, while gaining a deeper understanding of the risks of this new feature.

## [Hacking like in the Movies: Visualizing Page Tables for Local Exploitation](#Wicherski)

A shiny and sparkling way to break user-space ASLR, kernel ASLR and even find driver bugs! Understanding how a specific Operating System organizes its Page Tables allow you to find your own ASLR bypasses and even driver vulnerabilities. We will drop one 0day Android ASLR bypass as an example; you can then break all your other expensive toys yourself. Page Tables are the data structures that map between the virtual address space your programs see to the actual physical addresses identifying locations on your physical RAM chips. We will visualize these data structures for:

* Windows 8 on x86\_64
* Windows 8 RT on ARMv7
* Linux 3.8 on x86\_64
* Linux 3.4 on ARMv7 alias Android 4.2
* XNU on x86\_64 alias OS X
* XNU on ARMv7 alias iOS

Besides showing pretty pictures, we will actually explain what they show and how to interpret commonalities and differences across the same
kernel on different architectures.

By comparing the page table state on the same architecture across different runs, we will identify static physical mappings created by
drivers, which can be useful for DMA attacks (think FireWire or Thunderbolt forensics). Static virtual mappings are even more interesting and can be used for (K)ASLR bypasses.

To make a final point, that this is not only nice to look at, we will show how we found a mitigated Android <= 4.0.x generic user-space ASLR
bypass. For those interested in actually owning targets, we will show an Android 4.2.2 generic user-space ASLR bypass that also affects other
latest Linux/ARM kernels.

## [Hacking, Surveilling, and Deceiving victims on Smart TV](#Lee)

Smart TVs sold over 80,000,000 units around the world in 2012. This next generation "smart" platform is becoming more and more popular. On the other hand, we hardly see security research on Smart TVs. This presentation will cover vulnerabilities we've found on the platform.

You can imagine that Smart TVs have almost the exact same attack vectors that PC and Smart Phones have. Also, Smart TVs have interesting new attack surface such as the remote controller. We'll talk about attack points for Smart TV platform and cover security bugs we discovered. This talk will mostly focus on what attackers can do on a hacked Smart TV.

For example, expensive Smart TVs have many hardware devices like a Camera or Mic which, if remotely controlled, means bad guys can spy remotely without you knowing. Even more, it is possible to make Smart TVs monitor you 24/7 even though users turn off their TV, meaning #1984 could be done.

In addition, we'll point out a difference of viewpoint on leaked information type among PC, Smart Phone and Smart TV. Lastly, we'll give demo of live remote surveillance cam, which is sent to attacker's server at this talk.

This talk is an extended version of one, which I gave at CANSECWEST. It will demonstrate a spoofed news story on a hacked Smart TV and possibly TVshing (Smart TV edition of phishing.)

## [Hiding @ Depth - Exploring, Subverting and Breaking NAND Flash memory](#Thomas1)

In the world of digital storage, gone are the days of spinning platters and magnetic residue. These technologies have been replaced with electron trapping, small voltage monitoring and a lot of magic. These NAND devices are ubiquitous across our culture; from smart phones to laptops to USB memory sticks to GPS navigation devices. We carry many of these devices in our pockets daily without considering the security implications. The NAND-Xplore project is an attempt to explain how NAND Flash storage functions and to expose logical weaknesses in the hardware and implementation architectures. The project also showcases how the vulnerable underpinnings of NAND hardware can be subverted to hide and persist files on mobile devices. The project will release two open source POC tools for Android, one to inject and hide files on raw NAND based devices and another to find those files. The tools will showcase how advanced malware or other offensive tools could be using NAND to hide peristent files on your devices and how you would go about discovering them. The project also considers how typical forensic software interacts with NAND devices and how those tools can be subverted. Lastly, the talk will cover how remote NAND manipulation can brick devices beyond repair, from Smartphones to SCADA, and how this vulnerability cannot realistically be patched or fixed (Hint: your current tools probably don't work as well as you would like to believe).

## [Home Invasion v2.0 - Attacking Network-Controlled Hardware](#Crowley)

A growing trend in electronics is to have them integrate with your home network in order to provide potentially useful features like automatic updates or to extend the usefulness of existing technologies such as door locks you can open and close from anywhere in the world. What this means for us as security professionals or even just as people living in a world of network-connected devices is that being compromised poses greater risk than before.

Once upon a time, a compromise only meant your data was out of your control. Today, it can enable control over the physical world resulting in discomfort, covert audio/video surveillance, physical access or even personal harm. If your door lock or space heater are compromised, you're going to have a very bad day. This talk will discuss the potential risks posed by network-attached devices and even demonstrate new attacks against products on the market today.

## [Honey, Iâm home!! - Hacking Z-Wave Home Automation Systems](#Fouladi)

Home automation systems provide a centralized control and monitoring function for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting and physical security systems. The central control panel and various household devices such as security sensors and alarm systems are connected with each other to form a mesh network over wireless or wired communication links and act as a âsmart homeâ. As you arrive home, the system can automatically open the garage door, unlock the front door and disable the alarm, light the downstairs, and turn on the TV.
According to a study by the consulting firm AMA Research, in 2011, the UK home automation market was worth around Â£65 million with 12% increase on the previous year. The total number of home automation system installations in the UK is estimated to be 189000 by now. The home automation market in the US was worth approximately $3.2 billion in 2010 and is expected to exceed $5.5 billion in 2016.

Zigbee and Z-wave wireless communication protocols are the most common used RF technology in home automation systems. Zigbee is based on an open specification (IEEE 802.15.4) and has been the subject of several academic and practical security researches. Z-wave is a proprietary wireless protocol that works in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical radio band (ISM). It transmits on the 868.42 MHz (Europe) and 908.42MHz (United States) frequencies designed for low-bandwidth data communications in embedded devices such as security sensors, alarms and home automation control panels. Unlike Zigbee, no public security research on Z-Wave protocol was available before our work. Z-wave protocol was only mentioned once during a DefCon 2011 talk when the presenter pointed the possibility of capturing the AES key exchange phase without a demonstration.

The Z-Wave protocol is gaining momentum against the Zigbee protocol with regards to home automation. This is partly due to a faster, and somewhat simpler, development process. Another benefit is that it is less subjected to signal interference compared to the Zigbee protocol, which operates on the widely populated 2.4 GHz band shared by both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices.

Z-wave chips have 128-bit AES crypto engines, which are used by access control systems, such as door locks, for authenticated packet encryption. An open source implementation of the Z-wave protocol stack, openzwave , is available but it does not support the encryption part as of yet. Our talk will show how the Z-Wave protocol can be subjected to attacks.

## [Hot Knives Through Butter: Bypassing Automated Analysis Systems](#Singh)

Diamonds are girlâs best friend, prime numbers are mathematicianâs best friend and automated analysis systems (AAS) are AV researcherâs best friend. Unfortunately, this fact is known by malware authors and hence techniques to evade automated analysis system are not only becoming an integral part of APT, but also many infamous malwares have resurrected and are using techniques to bypass the automated analysis system to stay under the radar.

The infamous Khelios botnet was claimed to be dead in 2011 and got resurrected . To evade the automated analysis system one of the sample aka Trojan Nap found in 2013, was employing SleepEx() API with a 10 minutes time out. Since automated analysis systems are set to execute a sample within a given time frame ,which is in seconds, by employing an extended sleep call, it could prevent an AAS from capturing its behavior. The sample also made a call to the undocumented API NtDelayExecution() for performing an extended sleep calls.

As per the report from Mandiant, infamous RAT Poison IVY has extensively been used in the targeted attacks and appeared to have been abandoned in 2008. Trojan UpClicker, reported in December 2012, a wrapper around Poison IVY, employs SetWindowsHookEX() API to hide its malicious activity. By sending 0EH as parameter to the function, the malicious code only gets activated when the left mouse button is clicked and released. Since in AAS there is no human interaction, the code remains dormant bypassing the AAS.

PushDo, yet another infamous malware, checks the build number of windows OS. Once it has determined the build number of windows OS. It finds a pointer to PspCreateProcessNotify() API routine to deregister all the callbacks. Once the callbacks have been deregistered, the malware can create or delete processes, bypassing process monitoring module of AAS.

Trojan Hastati was designed to wipe out all the hard drives of a computer in Korea. It used GetLocalTime() API to activate itself on March 20th 2013 at 2:00 P.M. If the sample is executed in an AAS before the 20th March 2013, it will not get executed and evades AAS.

UpClicker, PushDo, Hastati, Nap are some of the resurrected advanced malware and/or APT which are using anti evasion techniques to evade detections from AAS.

In first part of the presentation we provide an exhaustive list of techniques, APIâs and the code segments from the APT and active malware, which are being used to bypass the AAS. We will also have live demonstration of some of the anti-analysis techniques, which have emerged in the recent past.

In the next part of the presentation we provide an in-depth, technical analysis of the Automated Analysis System technologies available today focusing on computer security aspect. It will provide a comparison framework for different technologies that is consistent, measurable, and understandable by both IT administrators and security specialists. In addition we also explore each of the major commercially available automated analysis system flavors and evaluate their ability to stand against these evasions. We will present an architectural decomposition of automated analysis systems to highlight its advantages and limitations, and historical view on how fast Anti-AAS techniques have been evolved so rapidly recently. This will kick start the conversation on how new vectors that are likely to be used by sophisticated malware to actively target AAS in the future.

## [HOW CVSS is DOSsing YOUR PATCHING POLICY (and wasting your money)](#Allodi)

CVSS score is widely used as the standard-de-facto risk metric for vulnerabilities, to the point that the US Government itself encourages organizations in using it to prioritize vulnerability patching. We tackle this approach by testing the CVSS score in terms of its efficacy as a "risk score" and "prioritization metric." We test the CVSS against real attack data and as a result, we show that the overall picture is not satisfactory: the (lower-bound) over-investment by using CVSS to choose what vulnerabilities to patch can as high as 300% of an optimal one. We extend the analysis making sure to obtain statistically significant results. However, we present our results at a practical level, focusing on the question: "does it make sense for you to use CVSS to prioritize your vulnerabilities?"

## [How to Grow a TREE (Taint-enabled Reverse Engineering Environment) From CBASS (Cross-platform Binary Automated Symbolic-execution System)](#Li)

Binary analysis techniques from academic research have been introduced into the reverse engineering community as well as research labs that are equipped with lots of computing power. Some program analyses using these techniques have even begun to show up in hacker conferences. But significant limitations remain:

* No practical toolset delivers analyses of binary programs across multiple platforms (like x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC etc.);
* No practical toolset scales to real-world large programs and automates all aspects of highly sophisticated tasks like vulnerability analysis and exploit generation;
* No practical toolset runs on a typical engineerâs laptop or integrates seamlessly with any popular reverse engineering environment. Interested reverse engineers must switch back and forth between their familiar tool environment and some Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) environment (like PIN) or full system emulator (like QEMU).

In this talk, we will present our solution to these limitations. We will explain the Cross-platform Binary Automated Symbolic-execution System (CBASS) that we developed and demonstrate one of its interactive applications: an IDA based Taint-enabled Reverse Engineering Environment (TREE). TREE can deliver program analysis techniques (taint analysis, dynamic slicing, symbolic execution and constraint solving) into the reverse engineerâs hands now.
Binary analysis and its security applications have been extensively researched, mainly in the context of a single instruction set architecture (predominantly x86) and popular desktop operating systems (Linux or Windows). CBASS performs its binary analysis on a common Intermediate Representation (IR) rather than on the native Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of any program. This thin layer allows our powerful analysis tools to work on cross-platform binary applications.

While CBASS supports both automated and interactive security applications, TREE supports a subset of these capabilities but from with an IDA Pro plug-in. TREE provides useful interactive visualizations of the results of on-demand binary analysis. Symbolic execution and concolic execution (concrete-symbolic execution) are fundamental techniques used in binary analysis; but they are plagued by the exponential path explosion problem. Solving this problem requires vigorous path pruning algorithms and highly parallel computing infrastructure (like clouds). Neither of these is typically available to a reverse engineer. TREE solves this problem by helping the reverse engineer prioritize path execution through an interactive and intuitive visual representation of the results of on-demand analysis of what inputs and instruction sequences led to the crash site or other suspicious path, leverage path constraints and SMT solver to negate tainted branch condition for a new, unexplored path. The details of the taint analysis, dynamic slicing and path constraint solving mechanisms are transparent to reverse engineer.

Utilizing the existing IDA Pro debugging infrastructure, TREE can automate trace generation from diversified target platforms, including kernel mode tracing for Windows. To our surprise, despite the fact that IDA Pro debugging API has been around for a long time, there has been no serious effort to automate trace collection for extensible binary analysis, particularly for kernel mode tracing. Our work has directly contributed to two bug fixes in the latest IDA Pro patches (IDA 6.4.130206). Our presentation will feature several case studies of using TREE to analyze real world vulnerabilities.

## [Hunting the Shadows: In Depth Analysis of Escalated APT Attacks](#Yarochkin)

APT attacks are a new emerging threat and have made headlines in recent years. However, we have yet to see full-scale assessment of targeted attack operations. Taiwan has been a long term target for these cyber-attacks due to its highly developed network infrastructure and sensitive political position. We had a unique chance to monitor, detect, investigate, and mitigate a large number of attacks on government and private sector companies. This presentation will introduce our results of a joint research between Xecure-Lab and Academia Sinica on targeted attack operations across the Taiwan Strait. We have developed a fully automated system, XecScan 2.0 (http://scan.xecure-lab.com) equipped with unique dynamic (sandbox) and static malicious software forensics technology to analyze nature and behavior of malicious binaries and document exploits. The system performs real-time APT classification and associates the analyzed content with existing knowledge base. In our experiments, the XecScan system has analyzed and successfully identified more than 12,000 APT emails, which include APT Malware and Document Exploits. With this presentation we will also analyze and group the samples from the recent Mandiant APT1(61398) Report and will compare the relationships between APT1 samples to the samples discovered in Taiwan and discuss the history behind APT1 Hacker activities. During this presentation we will release a free, publicly accessible portal to our collaborative APT classification platform and access to the XecScan 2.0 APIs.

## [I Can Hear You Now: Traffic Interception and Remote Mobile Phone Cloning with a Compromised CDMA Femtocell](#Ritter)

I have a box on my desk that your CDMA cell phone will automatically connect to while you send and receive phone calls, text messages, emails, and browse the Internet. I own this box. I watch all the traffic that crosses it and you don't even know you're connected to me. Welcome to the New World, where I, not them, own the towers. Oh, and thanks for giving me the box... for free.

This box is a femtocell, a low-power cellular base station given or sold to subscribers by mobile network operators. It works just like a small cell tower, using a home Internet connection to interface with the provider network. When in range, a mobile phone will connect to a femtocell as if it were a standard cell tower and send all its traffic through it without any indication to the user.

The state-of-the-art authentication protecting cell phone networks can be an imposing target. However, with the rising popularity of femtocells there is more than one way to attack a cellular network. Inside, they run Linux, and they can be hacked.

During this talk, we will demonstrate how we've used a femtocell for traffic interception of voice/SMS/data, active network attacks, and explain how we were able to clone a mobile device without physical access.

## [Implantable Medical Devices: Hacking Humans](#Jack)

In 2006 approximately 350,000 pacemakers and 173,000 ICD's (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators) were implanted in the US alone. 2006 was an important year, as that's when the FDA began approving fully wireless based devices. Today there are well over 3 million pacemakers and over 1.7 million ICD's in use.

This talk will focus on the security of wireless implantable medical devices. I will discuss how these devices operate and communicate and the security shortcomings of the current protocols. Our internal research software will be revealed that utilizes a common bedside transmitter to scan for, and interrogate individual medical implants.

I will also discuss ideas manufacturers can implement to improve the security of these devices.

## [Is that a government in your network or are you just happy to see me?](#Fiterman)

Defense and military network operations center around the age-old game: establishing long-term footholds deep inside a network. In this talk, we will discuss specific techniques and tactics observed while providing defensive incident response services to organizations compromised by foreign intelligence and defense agencies. The discussion will also incorporate the release and open-sourcing of several private projects used to identify pass-the-hash/impersonation attacks, including: a set of network monitoring daemons known as breachbox, part of which was funded by DARPA's Cyber Fast Track program; and an open-source tool and blueprint to help trojanize your own network to monitor and detect adversarial activity.

## [Java Every-Days: Exploiting Software Running on 3 Billion Devices](#Gorenc)

Over the last three years, Oracle Java has become the exploit author's best friend, and why not? Java has a rich attack surface, broad install base, and runs on multiple platforms allowing attackers to maximize their return-on-investment. The increased focus on uncovering weaknesses in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) shifted research beyond classic memory corruption issues into abuses of the reflection API that allow for remote code execution. This talk focuses on the vulnerability trends in Java over the last three years and intersects public vulnerability data with Java vulnerabilities submitted to the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) program. We begin by reviewing Java's architecture and patch statistics to identify a set of vulnerable Java components. We then highlight the top five vulnerability types seen in ZDI researcher submissions that impact these JRE components and emphasize their recent historical significance. The presentation continues with an in-depth look at specific weaknesses in several Java sub-components, including vulnerability details and examples of how the vulnerabilities manifest and what vulnerability researchers should look for when auditing the component. Finally, we discuss how attackers typically leverage weaknesses in Java. We focus on specific vulnerability types attackers and exploit kits authors are using and what they are doing beyond the vulnerability itself to compromise machines. We conclude with details on the vulnerabilities that were used in this year's Pwn2Own competition and review steps Oracle has taken to address recent issues uncovered in Java.

## [Javascript Static Security Analysis made easy with JSPrime](#Patnaik)

Today, more and more developers are switching to JavaScript as their first choice of language. The reason is simple JavaScript has now been started to be accepted as the mainstream programming for applications, be it on the web or on the mobile; be it on client-side, be it on the server side. JavaScript flexibility and its loose typing is friendly to developers to create rich applications at an unbelievable speed. Major advancements in the performance of JavaScript interpreters, in recent days, have almost eliminated the question of scalability and throughput from many organizations. So the point is JavaScript is now a really important and powerful language we have today and it's usage growing everyday. From client-side code in web applications it grew to server-side through Node.JS and it's now supported as proper language to write applications on major mobile operating system platforms like Windows 8 apps and the upcoming Firefox OS apps.

But the problem is, many developers practice in-secure coding which leads to many clients side attacks, out of which DOM XSS is the most infamous. We tried to understand the root cause of this problem and figured out is that there are not enough practically usable tools that can solve real-world problems. Hence as our first attempt towards solving this problem, we want to talk about JSPrime: A javascript static analysis tool for the rest of us. It's a very light-weight and very easy to use point-and-click tool! The static analysis tool is based on the very popular Esprima ECMAScript parser by Aria Hidayat.

I would like to highlight some of the interesting features of the tool below:

* JS Library Aware Source & Sinks

+ Most dynamic or static analyzers are developed to support native/pure JavaScript which actually is a problem for most developers since the introductions and wide-adoption for JavaScript frameworks/libraries like jQuery, YUI etc. Since these scanners are designed to support pure JavaScript, they fail at understanding the context of the development due to the usage of libraries and produce many false-positives and false-negatives. To solve this we have identified the dangerous user input sources and code execution sink functions for jQuery and YUI, for the initial release and we shall talk about how users can easily extend it for other frameworks.

* Variable & Function Tracing

+ This feature is a part of our code flow analysis algorithm

* Variable & Function Scope Aware analysis

+ This feature is a part of our code flow analysis algorithm

* Known filter function aware
* OOP & Protoype Compliant
* Minimum False Positive alerts
* Supports minified javascript
* Blazing fast performance
* Point and Click :-) (my personal favorite)

Upcoming features:

* Automatic code de-obfuscation & decompression through Hybrid Analysis (Ra.2 improvisation; <http://code.google.com/ra2-dom-xss-scanner>)
* ECMAScript family support (ActionScript 3, Node.JS, WinJS)

## [Just-In-Time Code Reuse: The more things change, the more they stay the same](#Snow)

Fine-grained address space layout randomization (ASLR) has recently been proposed as a method of efficiently mitigating runtime attacks. In this presentation, we introduce the design and implementation of a framework based on a novel attack strategy, dubbed just-in-time code reuse, which both undermines the benefits of fine-grained ASLR and greatly enhances the ease of exploit development on today's platforms that combine standard ASLR and DEP (e.g. Windows 8). Specifically, we derail the assumptions embodied in fine-grained ASLR by exploiting the ability to repeatedly abuse a memory disclosure to map an application's memory layout on-the-fly, dynamically discover API functions and gadgets, and JIT-compile a target program using those gadgets-- all within a script environment at the time an exploit is launched. We demonstrate the power of our framework by using it in conjunction with a real-world exploit against Internet Explorer, show its effectiveness in Windows 8, and also provide extensive evaluations that demonstrate the practicality of just-in-time code reuse attacks. Our findings suggest that fine-grained ASLR may not be as promising as first thought.

## [KickaaS Defense with Cloud and Software Defined Security](#Mogull)

While everyone else is busy spreading uneducated FUD on the supposed insecurity of cloud computing, the reality is cloud computing, and it's foundational technologies, bring tools to the table security pros previously could only dream of. Virtualization, segregation, and isolation are now defaults, not hard-to-achieve end states. Security is decoupled and abstracted from infrastructure, enabling levels of granularity and control nearly impossible with traditional architectures. APIs bind it all together, powering insanely effective security automation and intelligence.

This session will present practical techniques to leverage cloud computing and API-driven Software Defined Security to build stronger, more resilient, and more responsive defenses than aren't even close to possible with traditional infrastructure. We'll show what works today, including technical demonstrations, and tell you what to expect once security vendors wake up and really start riding the wave.

## [Lawful Access Panel](#Blaze)

Protecting yourself, your network and your users when the FBI or NSA knocks:

When you get a National Security Letter, no one can hear you scream. Being served with a search warrant for a criminal investigation can be scary enough, but national security investigations can be downright Kafkaesque. You probably won't be allowed to tell anyone about it. And they may ask for more than just user data, such as for backdoor access or to install special monitoring hardware or software deep inside your network. This panel will bring together a range of expertise on the perils of secret "lawful intercepts" in today's networks. We'll discuss the technical risks of surveillance architectures, the legal and technical defenses against over-broad or invasive searches, and actual experiences fighting against secret surveillance orders.

## [Legal Aspects of Full Spectrum Computer Network (Active) Defense](#Clark)

Full spectrum computer network (active) defense mean more than simply âhacking back.â Weâve seen a lot of this issue lately. Orin Kerr and Stewart Baker had a lengthy debate about it online. New companies with some high visibility players claim they are providing âactive defenseâ services to their clients. But all-in-all, what does this really mean? And why is it that when you go to your attorneys, they say a flat out, âNo.â

This presentation examines the entire legal regime surrounding full spectrum computer network (active) defense. It delves into those areas that are easily legal and looks at the controversial issues surrounding others. As such we will discuss technology and sensors (ECPA and the service provider exception); information control and management (DRM); and, âactive defenseâ focusing on â honeypot, beacons, deception (say hello to my little friend the Security and Exchange Commission); open source business intelligence gathering (CFAA, economic espionage; theft of trade secrets); trace back and retrieval of stolen data (CFAA).

Past presentations have shown much of what is taken away is audience driven in response to their questions and the subsequent discussion. And, as always, I try to impress upon computer security professionals the importance of working closely with their legal counsel early and often, and of course âClarkâs Lawâ - explain the technical aspects of computer security to your attorneys at a third grade level so they can understand it and then turn around and explain it to a judge or jury at a first grade level.

## [Legal Considerations for Cellular Research](#Hofmann1)

The security of mobile communications is becoming increasingly critical, prompting security researchers to focus their attention on vulnerabilities in cellular systems. Researchers need to fully understand the legal ramifications of interacting with specialized hardware, cellular communications, and the restrictions imposed by service providers. This briefing will provide a legal overview of what a researcher should keep in mind when investigating mobile communications, technologies, and networks. We will cover legal issues raised by end user license agreements, jailrooting or rooting devices, and intercepting communications.

## [Lessons from Surviving a 300Gbps Denial of Service Attack](#Prince)

On Saturday, March 23, 2013, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against Spamhaus that had been growing for weeks culminated with over 300 Gigabits per second of attack traffic targeting the anti-spam organization's network. At that point it became the largest such attack ever reported in history â at least 4x the size of the attacks that crippled US banks just a few months earlier. The attackers launched the full range DDoS methods at Spamhaus â simultaneously targeting Layer 3, Layer 4, and Layer 7. Spamhaus has given us permission to tell the full, behind-the-scenes story of what happened, show how the attacks were launched, outline the techniques the attackers used, and detail how Spamhaus.com was able to stay online throughout. While the Spamhaus story has a happy ending, the massive DDoS exposed key vulnerabilities throughout the Internet that we will need address if the network is to survive the next, inevitably larger, attack.

This is not your grandpaâs talk on physical security; this talk is about bypassing home and office digital physical security systems, from simple door sensors to intercepting signals and even the keypad before it can alert the authorities. All the methods presented are for covert entry and leave no physical sign of entry or compromise. If you are interested in bettering your skills as a pen tester or just want to know how break into an office like a Hollywood spy this is the talk for you. Come join us to see live demos of what the security companies never want you to see.

## [Mactans: Injecting Malware into iOS Devices via Malicious Chargers](#Lau)

Apple iOS devices are considered by many to be more secure than other mobile offerings. In evaluating this belief, we investigated the extent to which security threats were considered when performing everyday activities such as charging a device. The results were alarming: despite the plethora of defense mechanisms in iOS, we successfully injected arbitrary software into current-generation Apple devices running the latest operating system (OS) software. All users are affected, as our approach requires neither a jailbroken device nor user interaction.

In this presentation, we demonstrate how an iOS device can be compromised within one minute of being plugged into a malicious charger. We first examine Appleâs existing security mechanisms to protect against arbitrary software installation, then describe how USB capabilities can be leveraged to bypass these defense mechanisms. To ensure persistence of the resulting infection, we show how an attacker can hide their software in the same way Apple hides its own built-in applications.

To demonstrate practical application of these vulnerabilities, we built a proof of concept malicious charger, called Mactans, using a BeagleBoard. This hardware was selected to demonstrate the ease with which innocent-looking, malicious USB chargers can be constructed. While Mactans was built with limited amount of time and a small budget, we also briefly consider what more motivated, well-funded adversaries could accomplish. Finally, we recommend ways in which users can protect themselves and suggest security features Apple could implement to make the attacks we describe substantially more difficult to pull off.

## [Mainframes: The Past Will Come Back to Haunt You](#Young)

From governments to military, airlines to banks, the mainframe is alive and well and touches you in everything you do. The security community that's tasked with reviewing the security on mainframes, though, actually knows very little about these beasts. Be it a lack of access by the security community or the false notion that mainframes are dead, there is a distinct gap between the IT security world and the mainframe world. Mainframes in the IT security community are talked about in whispered hushed tones in the back alleys. Neither knowing if they're as secure as IBM (and mainframers) claim or if they're ripe with configuration problems ready to be exploited. This talk will remove some of the mystery surrounding the mainframe, breaking down that 'legacy wall.' Discussing how security is implemented on the mainframe (including where to find configuration files), how to access it, simple networking and configuration commands, file structure etc. will be presented at this session.

## [Maltego Tungsten as a collaborative attack platform](#Temmingh)

Maltego has always been a strong favorite for pre-attack intelligence gathering - be that for social engineering, doxing or for infrastructure mapping. Indeed it's earned its rightful place in the Kali Linux top 10 tools.

For as long as we can remember we at Paterva were annoyed that Maltego lacked the ability to share intelligence effectively. Up to now the only way to share graphs was to send the actual files around. This is all about to change - with Maltego Tungsten. The Tungsten release (at BlackHat) allows multiple users to share graphs in real time. This creates interesting opportunities and new workflows - suddenly we can have a team of analysts and/or pen testers working together in real time and on the same goal. Be it profiling (or 'doxing') a human target or attacking a network - with real time graph sharing we now have a platform where information can be safely (and anonymously) shared as it happens.

The other lacking aspect of Maltego was real bite. In the past we purposely stayed away from all out attack - concentrating rather on info gathering. In this talk we'll also show how to integrate Maltego with industry standard attack tools. This will range from infrastructure attacks, web platform attack and remote Trojans to social engineering as well as denial of service.

Combine human intelligence, machines (introduced in Radium release) and real time collaboration with these powerful transforms and wait... oh noes...we've created a monster!!

## [Million Browser Botnet](#Grossman)

Online advertising networks can be a web hackerâs best friend. For mere pennies per thousand impressions (that means browsers) there are service providers who allow you to broadly distribute arbitrary javascript -- even malicious javascript! You are SUPPOSED to use this âfeatureâ to show ads, to track users, and get clicks, but that doesnât mean you have to abide. Absolutely nothing prevents spending $10, $100, or more to create a massive javascript-driven browser botnet instantly. The real-world power is spooky cool. We know, because we tested itâ¦ in-the-wild.

With a few lines of HTML5 and javascript code weâll demonstrate just how you can easily commandeer browsers to perform DDoS attacks, participate in email spam campaigns, crack hashes and even help brute-force passwords. Put simply, instruct browsers to make HTTP requests they didnât intend, even something as well-known as Cross-Site Request Forgery. With CSRF, no zero-days or malware is required. Oh, and there is no patch. The Web is supposed to work this way. Also nice, when the user leaves the page, our code vanishes. No traces. No tracks.

Before leveraging advertising networks, the reason this attack scenario didnât worry many people is because it has always been difficult to scale up, which is to say, simultaneously control enough browsers (aka botnets) to reach critical mass. Previously, web hackers tried poisoning search engine results, phishing users via email, link spamming Facebook, Twitter and instant messages, Cross-Site Scripting attacks, publishing rigged open proxies, and malicious browser plugins. While all useful methods in certain scenarios, they lack simplicity, invisibility, and most importantly -- scale. Thatâs what we want! At a momentâs notice, we will show how it is possible to run javascript on an impressively large number of browsers all at once and no one will be the wiser. Today this is possible, and practical.

## [OptiROP: hunting for ROP gadgets in style](#Anh)

Return-Oriented-Programming (ROP) is the fundamental technique to bypass the widely-used DEP-based exploitation mitigation. Unfortunately, available tools that can help to find ROP gadgets mainly rely on syntactic searching. This method proves to be in inefficient, time-consuming and makes the process of developing ROP-based shellcode pretty frustrated for exploitation writers.

This research attempts to solve the problem by introducing a tool named OptiROP that lets exploitation writers search for ROP gadgets with semantic queries. OptiROP supports input binary of all executable formats (PE/ELF/Mach-O) on x86 & x86\_64 architectures. Combining sophisticated techniques such as code normalization, code optimization, code slicing, SMT solver, parallel processing and some heuristic searching methods, OptiROP is able to discover desired gadgets very quickly, with much less efforts. Our tool also provides the detail semantic meaning of each gadget found, so users can easily decide how to chain their gadgets for the final shellcode.

In case where no suitable gadget is found, OptiROP tries to pick and chain available gadgets to create a sequence of gadgets satisfying the input requirements. This significantly eases the hard job of shellcode writers, so they can focus their time on other tedious parts of the exploitation process.

Our talk will entertain the audience with some live demo, so they can see how OptiROP generates gadgets in reality.

## [The Outer Limits: Hacking the Samsung Smart TV](#Grattafiori)

There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling the transmission.

"Smart" TVs are becoming more and more common. Samsung and other vendors such as Sony and LG have sold more than a hundred million Smart TVs in the last few years. During this talk, Aaron Grattafiori and Josh Yavor will discuss the Samsung SmartTV design, attack surfaces and overall insecurity of the platform. A short discussion of the current application stack, TV operating system and other details will be provided to help set the stage for details of significant flaws found within the Samsung SmartTV application architecture, APIs and current applications.

A number of vulnerabilities will be explored and demonstrated which allow malicious developers or remotely hijacked applications (such as the web browser or social media applications) to take complete control of the TV, steal accounts stored within it and install a userland rootkit. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities also provides the ability for an attacker to use the front-facing video camera or built-in microphone for spying and surveillance as well as facilitate access to local network for continued exploitation. This talk will also discuss methods to bypass what (meager) security protections exist and put forth several worst case scenarios (TV worm anyone?).

Concluding this talk, Aaron and Josh will discuss what has been fixed by Samsung and discuss what overall weaknesses should be avoided by future "Smart" platforms. Video demos of exploits and userland rootkits will be provided.

## [Owning the Routing Table - Part II](#Nakibly)

The holy grail of routing attacks is owning the routing table of a router. In this work we present a powerful OSPF attack that exploit a newly discovered ambiguity of the OSPF protocol -- the most popular routing protocol inside autonomous systems (AS). The attack allows an attacker who gained control over just a single router in an AS to control the routing tables of all other routers in that AS. The attack may be utilized to induce black holes, network cuts or longer routes in order to facilitate DoS of the routing domain or to gain access to information flows which otherwise the attacker had no access to. The attack can also be used to easily DoS a victim router using a single packet. A multi-vendor effort is now under way to fix this vulnerability which currently inflict many of today's OSPF routers. This work is a sequel to the work "Owning the Routing Table" we presented at Black Hat USA 2011.

This is a joint work with Eitan Menahem, Yuval Elovici and Ariel Waizel of Telekom Innovation Laboratories at Ben Gurion University.

## [Pixel Perfect Timing Attacks with HTML5](#Stone)

Maybe youâve heard it before - HTML 5 and related technologies bring a whole slew of new features to web browsers, some of which can be a threat to security and privacy. But subtle interactions between the less explored corners of new browser features can have some unexpected and dangerous side effects.

In this presentation, Iâll introduce a number of new techniques that use JavaScript-based timing attacks to extract sensitive data from your browser. In my talk I will demonstrate cross-browser vulnerabilities against Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox that can be used to access your browsing history and read data from websites youâre logged into. Iâll also take a look at the difficulties involved in fixing these types of vulnerabilities.

## [Post Exploitation Operations with Cloud Synchronization Services](#Williams)

Cloud backup solutions, such as Dropbox, provide a convenient way for users to synchronize files between user devices. These services are particularly attractive to users, who always want the most current version of critical files on every device. Many of these applications âinstallâ into the userâs profile directory and the synchronization processes are placed in the userâs registry hive (HKCU). Users without administrative privileges can use these applications without so much as popping a UAC dialog. This freedom makes illicit installations of these applications all the more likely.

Cloud backup providers are marketing directly to corporate executives offering services that will âincrease employee productivityâ or âprovide virtual teaming opportunities.â Offers such as these make it more likely than ever that any given corporate environment has some cloud backup solutions installed.

We released the DropSmack tool at Blackhat EU. This showed enterprise defenders the risks posed by cloud synchronization software and gave pen testers a new toy to play with (you can bet that pen testers werenât the only ones who noticed). In response to feedback from the original presentation, DropSmack has been improved to deal with some of the unique operational challenges posed by synchronization environments. In particular, we added the ability to work with more synchronization services automatically.

In this talk, weâll demonstrate how DropSmack v2 works and explain how to deploy it in an operational environment. Weâll look at some of the countermeasures to these attacks, including the encryption of synchronized files by third party software. Additionally, weâll investigate the potential of using so-called ânext generation firewallsâ to defeat DropSmack.

Youâll also learn about the issues of credential storage in the context of cloud synchronization services. Several synchronization applications also use insecure authentication methods. Weâll highlight these applications so you know what works, what doesnât, and what you should run (not walk) away from. Youâll learn about post-exploitation activities you can accomplish when your freshly compromised target is running a cloud synchronization product.

Finally, weâll demonstrate the steps you need to follow to steal credentials for the products that store them. Why would you want to steal stored credentials for a cloud synchronization service you ask? After all, any files that have been synchronized to the cloud must already on the machine you just compromised, right? Not necessarily. Youâll learn a variety of nasty things you can do with the cloud synchronization service portals that you may never have considered.,/

If youâre a network defender, youâll leave this talk with a new appreciation of the risks posed by cloud synchronization services (and a nauseous feeling if you have them in your environment). If you are a penetration tester, youâll leave with a new bag of tricks. Either way, a fun time is sure to be had by all.

## [Power Analysis Attacks for Cheapskates](#OFlynn)

Power analysis attacks present a devious method of cracking cryptographic systems. But looking at papers published in this field show that often the equipment used is fairly expensive: the typical oscilloscope used often has at least a 1 GSPS sampling rate, and then various probes and amplifiers also add to this cost. What is a poor researcher to do without such tools? This presentation will give a detailed description of how to setup a power analysis lab for a few hundred dollars, one that provides sufficient performance to attack real devices. It's based on some open-source hardware & software I developed, and is small enough to fit in your pocket. This will be demonstrated live against a microcontroller implementing AES, with details provided so attendees can duplicate the demonstration. This includes an open-hardware design for the capture board, open-source Python tools for doing the capture, and open-source example attacks. Underlying theory behind side-channel attacks will be presented, giving attendees a complete picture of how such attacks work.

## [Predicting Susceptibility to Social Bots on Twitter](#Sumner)

Are some Twitter users more naturally predisposed to interacting with social bots and can social bot creators exploit this knowledge to increase the odds of getting a response?

Social bots are growing more intelligent, moving beyond simple reposts of boilerplate ad content to attempt to engage with users and then exploit this trust to promote a product or agenda. While much research has focused on how to identify such bots in the process of spam detection, less research has looked at the other side of the questionâdetecting users likely to be fooled by bots.
This talk provides a summary of research and developments in the social bots arms race before sharing results of our experiment examining user susceptibility.

We find that a usersâ Klout score, friends count, and followers count are most predictive of whether a user will interact with a bot, and that the Random Forest algorithm produces the best classifier, when used in conjunction with appropriate feature ranking algorithms. With this knowledge, social bot creators could significantly reduce the chance of targeting users who are unlikely to interact.

Users displaying higher levels of extraversion were more likely to interact with our social bots. This may have implications for eLearning based awareness training as users higher in extraversion have been shown to perform better when they have great control of the learning environment.

Overall, these results show promise for helping understand which users are most vulnerable to social bots.

## [Press ROOT to continue: Detecting OSX and Windows bootkits with RDFU](#Vuksan)

UEFI has recently become a very public target for rootkits and malware. Last year at Black Hat 2012, Snareâs insightful talk highlighted the real and very significant potential for developing UEFI rootkits that are very difficult, if not impossible, to detect and/or eradicate. Since then, a couple of practical bootkits have appeared.

To combat this new threat, we developed a Rootkit Detection Framework for UEFI (âRDFUâ) that incorporates a unified set of tools that address this problem across a wide spectrum of UEFI implementations. We will demonstrate a sample bootkit for Apple OSX that was designed specifically for testing purposes. As a UEFI driver, it infects the OSX kernel utilizing a UEFI ârootkitâ technique. The entire infection process executes in memory (by the UEFI driver itself). Therefore, the bootkit does not need to install any OSX kernel extension modules. The bootkit demonstrates the following functionality:

* Sniffing FileVault passwords (sniffing keys while booting)
* Privilege escalation (to root)
* Hiding PIDs, files, and directories with selected patterns

Rootkit Detection Framework for UEFI was developed under DARPA CFT. Following this talk, we will publicly release the RDFU open source code along with whitepapers that outline a possible use case for this technology.

## [Revealing Embedded Fingerprints: Deriving intelligence from USB stack interactions](#Davis)

Embedded systems are everywhere, from TVs to aircraft, printers to weapons control systems. As a security researcher when you are faced with one of these âblack boxesâ to test, sometime in-situ, it is difficult to know where to start. However, if there is a USB port on the device there is useful information that can be gained. This talk is about using techniques to analyze USB stack interactions to provide information such as the OS running on the embedded device, the USB drivers installed and devices supported. The talk will also cover some of the more significant challenges faced by researchers attempting to exploit USB vulnerabilities using a Windows 8 USB bug recently discovered by the presenter (MS13-027) as an example.

## [RFID Hacking: Live Free or RFID Hard](#Brown)

Have you ever attended an RFID hacking presentation and walked away with more questions than answers? This talk will finally provide practical guidance on how RFID proximity badge systems work. Weâll cover what youâll need to build out your own RFID physical penetration toolkit, and how to easily use an Arduino microcontroller to weaponize commercial RFID badge readers â turning them into custom, long range RFID hacking tools.

This presentation will NOT weigh you down with theoretical details, discussions of radio frequencies and modulation schemes, or talk of inductive coupling. It WILL serve as a practical guide for penetration testers to understand the attack tools and techniques available to them for stealing and using RFID proximity badge information to gain unauthorized access to buildings and other secure areas.
Schematics and Arduino code will be released, and 100 lucky audience members will receive a custom PCB they can insert into almost any commercial RFID reader to steal badge info and conveniently save it to a text file on a microSD card for later use (such as badge cloning). This solution will allow you to read cards from up to 3 feet away, a significant improvement over the few centimeter range of common RFID hacking tools.

Some of the topics we will explore are:

* Overview of best RFID hacking tools available to get for your toolkit
* Stealing RFID proximity badge info from unsuspecting passers-by
* Replaying RFID badge info and creating fake cloned cards
* Brute-forcing higher privileged badge numbers to gain data center access
* Attacking badge readers and controllers directly
* Planting PwnPlugs, Raspberry Pis, and similar devices as physical backdoors to maintain internal network access
* Creating custom RFID hacking tools using the Arduino
* Defending yourself from RFID hacking threats

This DEMO-rich presentation will benefit both newcomers and seasoned professionals of the physical penetration testing field.

## [Rooting SIM cards](#Nohl)

SIM cards are among the most widely-deployed computing platforms with over 7 billion cards in active use. Little is known about their security beyond manufacturer claims.

Besides SIM cardsâ main purpose of identifying subscribers, most of them provide programmable Java runtimes. Based on this flexibility, SIM cards are poised to become an easily extensible trust anchor for otherwise untrusted smartphones, embedded devices, and cars.

The protection pretense of SIM cards is based on the understanding that they have never been exploited. This talk ends this myth of unbreakable SIM cards and illustrates that the cards -- like any other computing system -- are plagued by implementation and configuration bugs.

## [The SCADA That Didn't Cry Wolf- Who's Really Attacking Your ICS Devices- Part Deux!](#Wilhoit)

These attackers had a plan, they acted upon their plan, and they were successful. In my first presentation, given at Black Hat EU in 2013, I covered a robust ICS honeynet that I developed, and who was really attacking them. In this talk, I cover many of the same concepts, but I go several steps further- profiling the attackers that exploited my ICS honeynet.

This talk will profile, provide intelligence, and list actors that attacked my ICS honeypot environment. This talk will also feature a demo of the attackers in progress, exfiltrating perceived sensitive data. In addition, I will discuss in greater detail how I geo-located these individuals, and tracked their movements, operations, and attacks.

Some of the findings are truly surprising and substantial, and my not be what you think they are. This talk will release brand new statistics and attack details seen nowhere else in the ICS community.

## [Smashing The Font Scaler Engine in Windows Kernel](#Lee1)

The Font Scaler Engine is widely used to scale the outline font definition such as TrueType/OpenType font for a glyph to a specific point size and converts the outline into a bitmap at a particular resolution. The revolution of font in computer that is mainly used for stylist purposes had make many users ignored its security issues. In fact, the Font Scaler engine could cause many security impacts especially in Windows kernel mode.

In this talk, the basic structure of the Font Scaler engine will be discussed. This includes the conversion of an outline into a bitmap, the mathematical description of each glyph in an outline font, a set of instruction in each glyph that instruct the Font Scaler Engine to modify the shape of the glyph, and the instruction interpreter etc.

Next, we introduce our smart font fuzzing method for identifying the new vulnerabilities of the Font Scaler engine. The different of dumb fuzzing and vulnerable functions will be explained and we will prove that the dumb fuzzing technique is not a good option for Windows Font Fuzzing.

Lastly, we focus on the attack vector that could be used to launch the attacks remotely and locally. A demonstration of the new TrueType font vulnerabilities and the attack vector on Windows 8 and Windows 7 will be shown.

## [SPY-JACKING THE BOOTERS](#Krebs)

It's become commonplace for security reporters and providers of security technologies to find themselves targets of hackers' wrath, especially when they put criminal activity under the spotlight. Earlier this year, Brian Krebs had done some work to expose a "booter" service. Like other public security figures, he found himself the target of repeated DDoS attacks. In Brian's case, this culminated in a "SWATting" attack -- a surprise visit by dozens of heavily armed police at his front door. Research on "booter" services reveals a relatively unsophisticated, but high-profit criminal community of DDoS-for-hire web sites that are capable of considerable impact. They operate under legal auspices, leveraging legitimate DDoS protection services. Anyone with an axe to grind and a small amount of money can hire one of these services to have virtually any person or web site knocked off the Internet. As an indicator of how mainstream these services have become, most of them accept payment via Paypal. This talk will delve into the recent proliferation of these malicious commercial DDoS services, and reveal what's been learned about their surreptitious functioning, exposing the proprietors behind these illicit services, and what is known about their targets and their thousands of paying customers. Emphasis will be placed on detailing the vulnerabilities present in most booter sites, and the lessons we can draw about how targets of these attacks can defend themselves.

## [SSL, gone in 30 seconds - a BREACH beyond CRIME](#Prado)

In this hands-on talk, we will introduce new targeted techniques and research that allows an attacker to reliably retrieve encrypted secrets (session identifiers, CSRF tokens, OAuth tokens, email addresses, ViewState hidden fields, etc.) from an HTTPS channel. We will demonstrate this new browser vector is real and practical by executing a PoC against a major enterprise product in under 30 seconds. We will describe the algorithm behind the attack, how the usage of basic statistical analysis can be applied to extract data from dynamic pages, as well as practical mitigations you can implement today. We will also describe the posture of different SaaS vendors vis-Ã -vis this attack. Finally, to provide the community with ability to build on our research, determine levels of exposure, and deploy appropriate protection, we will release the BREACH tool.

## [Stepping P3wns: Adventures in full-spectrum embedded exploitation (and defense!)](#Cui)

Our presentation focuses on two live demonstrations of exploitation and defense of a wide array of ubiquitous networked embedded devices like printers, phones and routers.

The first demonstration will feature a proof-of-concept embedded worm capable of stealthy, autonomous polyspecies propagation. This PoC worm will feature at least one\* 0-day vulnerability on Cisco IP phones as well as several embedded device vulnerabilities previously disclosed by the authors. We will demonstrate how an attacker can gain stealthy and persistent access to the victim network via multiple remote initial attack vectors against routers and printers. Once inside, we will show how the attacker can use other embedded devices as stepping-stones to compromise significant portions of the victim network without ever needing to compromise the general-purpose computers residing on the network. Our PoC worm is capable of network reconnaissance, manual full-mesh propagation between IP phones, network printers and common networking equipment. Finally, we will demonstrate fully autonomous reconnaissance and exploitation of all embedded devices on the demo network.

The second demonstration showcases host-based embedded defense techniques, called Symbiotes, developed by the authors at Columbia University under support from DARPAâs Cyber Fast Track and CRASH programs, as well as IARPAâs STONESOUP and DHSâs S&T Research programs. The Symbiote, is an OS and vendor agnostic host-based defense designed specifically for proprietary embedded systems. We will demonstrate the automated injection of Software Symbiotes into each vulnerable embedded device presented during the first demonstration. We then repeat all attack scenarios presented in the first demo against Symbiote defended devices to demonstrate real-time detection, alerting and mitigation of all malicious embedded implants used by our PoC worm. Lastly, we demonstrate the scalability and integration of Symbiote detection and alerting mechanisms into existing enterprise endpoint protection systems like Symantec End Point.

Over the past two years we have discovered vulnerabilities in and and developed exploits for several embedded system. 2011 had not only the version agnostic Cisco IOS rootkit (âKilling the Myth of Cisco IOS Diversityâ, Black Hat USA), but also the HP RFU vulnerability (âPrint Me if You Dareâ, 28C3). In 2012 we presented the Cisco IP phone kernel vulnerability (âHacking Cisco Phonesâ, 29C3) . While each exploit focused on one device, we posited polyspecies malware propagation in which a device of one type could be used to exploit a device of a completely different type. In this presentation, we demonstrate an HP printer being used to exploit two different Cisco IP phones (which includes a yet-to-be-disclosed privilege escalation exploit in the 8900/9900 series). We may throw in a fourth yet-to-be-named device just for good measure. We then take the same devices on the same network and install host-based defense to detect or prevent the same exploits.

## [Teridian SoC Exploitation: Exploration of harvard architecture smart grid systems](#Thomas2)

The Teridian 8051 based chips are found in a variety of places in daily life, from the smart energy grid to smart cards and pin-pads. While the most prominent placement in the US is currently the metrology and power measurement side of a smart meters, the 8051 core is ubiquitous in embedded devices. They are additionally found in power distribution automation (the backend power shoveling inside your utility) and home automation (monitoring energy usage and changing configuration of appliances and similar in the home).

The Teridian System-on-a-Chip platform wraps a complete system around a modified 8051 core, with additional features for chip security to block debug functionality and external access to memory. Additionally, the Harvard architecture design sets relatively rigid barriers between code and data (as opposed to x86/64), which presents an unintentional security barrier, somewhat similar to robust hardware DEP on x86/64 platforms.

In this talk, we will quickly cover architecture and system overviews, then dive into exploitation scenarios with techniques to attack Harvard architecture systems and code security implementations. End state results include pathways to gain coveted binary images of firmware and resident code execution.

## [TLS 'secrets'](#NextGen)

SSL and TLS have become the de-facto standards for transport-layer encryption. In recent years, many vulnerabilities have been uncovered in both the standards, their implementation and the way people configure and use them. This talk is exploring in details a lesser-known and much less talked about part of the standard which breaks some of the security properties one would expect. A tool allowing for forensic recovery of plaintext (even when PFS ciphers are in use) will be released.

## [Town Hall Meeting: CFAA Reform Strategy](#Opsahl)

Aaron Swartz, a brilliant computer programmer and activist, committed suicide in January. At the time of his passing, Aaron was facing criminal charges carrying the possibility of decades in prison based on his use of the MIT campus network to download millions of journal articles from a database of academic scholarship.

Aaron's death has prompted a vigorous public debate about the factors that contributed to his tragedy, including the many problems with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, including its vague language and harsh penalty scheme. The information security community has an important role to play in educating and persuading lawmakers to reform this dangerous law. In this town hall meeting, join activists involved in CFAA reform efforts to discuss how you can get involved in the public debate around CFAA reform and strategize about how to have the most impact.

## [UART THOU MAD?](#Kohlenberg)

Despite the fact that UART has been around FOREVER and is actually frequently used by vulnerability researchers in the hardware space, it has not been discussed as a dedicated topic on its own. This talk is intended to fill that gap. We will provide an overview of what UART is, the tools that exist to work with it and provide examples of why a security researcher should care. We will also explore why UART is a powerful friend for anyone who likes to repurpose hardware. We will also provide BKMs for companies building products that include UART to decrease the likelihood it will be used against them.

## [Universal DDoS Mitigation Bypass](#Miu)

Today's commercial DDoS mitigation technologies employ many different techniques for identifying DDoS traffics and blocking these threats. Common techniques range from basic malformed traffic check, to traffic profiling and rate limiting, to traffic source verification and so on, with captive redirection utilizing Javascript- or CAPTCHA-based authentications being the most effective by far. However, in our research weaknesses were found in each and every such technique.

We rolled all our exploits into a PoC attack tool, giving it near-perfect DDoS mitigation bypass capability against all existing commercial DDoS mitigation solutions. The ramification is huge because for vast majority of web sites, these mitigation solutions stand as their last line of defense, having this last line breached can expose these web sites' backend to devastating damages.

We have surveyed extensively the entire range of DDoS mitigation technologies available on the market today, uncovering the countermeasure techniques they employ, how they work and how to defeat each of them. Essentially bypass is achieved through emulating legit traffic characteristics. Afterwards our attack tool is introduced to demonstrate how all these exploits can be brought together to execute a "combo attack" to bypass all layers of protection in order to gain access to the backend.

To coincide with the publication of this talk, our highly effective \_attack\_tool\_will\_be\_made\_freely\_available\_. The effectiveness of this tool is illustrated via testing results against specific DDoS mitigation products and popular web sites known to be protected by specific technologies. To conclude our research, a next-gen mitigation technique is also proposed as a countermeasure against our attack methodology.

## [USING ONLINE ACTIVITY AS DIGITAL FINGERPRINTS TO CREATE A BETTER SPEAR PHISHER](#Espinhara)

Every day we produce tons of digital breadcrumbs through our activities in online services â from social networks, photo sharing, mailing lists, online forums and blogs to more specialized tools, such as commits to open source projects, music listening services and travel schedules. These have long been known to provide useful information when profiling a target for social engineering purposes, especially due to the frantic pace and often uncensored way at which we generate such content.

Our talk takes a tool-oriented approach to these profiling activities. By using data mining techniques combined with natural language processing, we can determine patterns in the way a user interacts with other users, his usual choice of vocabulary and phrasing, the friends/colleagues he most frequently communicates with as well as the topics discussed with them. By consuming publicly available data, using both official APIs and scraping web pages, our profile can be used to validate how close forged content is to actual target-generated data.

We will discuss the indexing of unstructured content, including issues such as the legal and technical implications of using official APIs versus scraping, how to build user relationship graphs and how to add temporal references to the collected data.

We will also release a tool that automates the data mining and natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured information available on public data sources, as well as comparing user created content against a generated profile using various criteria, including:

* Network of friends/colleagues;
* Frequency of communication with friends/colleagues;
* Shared interests between target and friends/colleagues;
* Hobbies and personal activities;
* Upcoming and past trips;
* Frequency of use of verbs;
* Frequency of use of adjectives;
* Frequency of use of nouns;
* Average number of words per sentence or paragraph.

## [Virtual Deobfuscator - a DARPA Cyber Fast Track funded effort](#Raber)

While there has been a lot research done on automatically reverse engineering of virtualization obfuscators, there has been no approach that did not require a lot of man-hours identifying the bytecode (static approaches) or a complete recreation of the bytecode back to original source form (dynamic approaches). The tool I created, Virtual Deobfuscator, will require no static man-hours reversing for the bytecode location or how the VM interpreter works, and will recreate instructions nearly equivalent to the original instructions.

## [What's on the Wire? Physical Layer Tapping with Project Daisho](#Spill)

We believe that flaws in network protocols will not be discovered unless physical layer communication tapping solutions are made available to security researchers. In order to have confidence in our communication media we need the ability to monitor and modify the packets transferred on the wire. 802.11 network monitoring allowed the flaws in WEP and WPA to be exposed, Bluetooth Low Energy monitoring has shown problems in the key exchange protocol, but we are often more trusting of wired connections. Project Daisho is an attempt to fix that trust by allowing researchers to investigate wired protocols using existing software tools wherever possible. Daisho is an open source, extensible, modular network tap for wired communication media such as gigabit Ethernet, HDMI connections, and USB 3.0 connections. All aspects of the project are open source, including the hardware designs, software and FPGA cores. The project is producing the first open source USB 3.0 FPGA core.

## [What Security Researchers Need to Know About Anti-Hacking Law](#Hofmann2)

The federal anti-hacking law, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, is infamous for its broad language and tough penalties, and has been used in recent years to bring heavy-handed charges against targets like Andrew Auernheimer (aka Weev) and Aaron Swartz. This presentation will explain why the CFAA is such a dangerous tool in the hands of overzealous prosecutors. I'll survey some of the legal precedents most relevant to the infosec community, including cases on port scanning, violating website terms of use, and designing tools capable of bypassing technical access controls. I'll also explain the prosecution against Weev in depth and discuss its greater implications for security researchers. Finally, I'll discuss what security professionals can learn from these cases to reduce the potential for legal trouble.

## [With BIGDATA comes BIG responsibility: Practical exploiting of MDX injections](#Chastuhin)

Letâs take a look into the place where critical data is stored for further analytics afterwards. Itâs Business Warehouse (BW) and Big Data. Classic online transaction processing systems (OLTP) are not quite suitable to process big data, so they were replaced by OLAP with its multi-dimensional structures. This technology is present in almost all Business Intelligence applications including key vendors like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. All the critical corporate data in one place, wellâ¦ isnât it a sweet target for an attacker?

The OLAP technology has brought a lot of new terms and concepts into the world: OLAP cube, measures, dimensions, XMLA, and the MDX language, which is used for requests to multi-dimensional data structures. In todayâs Business Intelligence (BI) marketplace, most OLAP servers and almost all BI clients talk in MDX. This talk will describe in detail all the entities of this technology and especially the MDX request language. The talk will also feature an overview of possible MDX-related attacks as well as an overview of code injection, data retrieval and update vectors.

Moreover, I will show some examples of the systems that can be exploited by MDX-related vulnerabilities, their system-related differences, post-exploitation vectors, and a cheat-sheet with a tool for simplifying MDX Injections.

## [') UNION SELECT `This\_Talk` AS ('New Optimization and Obfuscation Techniquesâ)%00](#Salgado)

This talk will present some of the newest and most advanced optimization and obfuscation techniques available in the field of SQL Injections. These techniques can be used to bypass web application firewalls and intrusion detection systems at an alarming speed. This talk will also demonstrate these techniques on both open-source and commercial firewalls and present the ALPHA version of a framework called Leapfrog which Roberto is developing; Leapfrog is designed to assist security professionals, IT administrators, firewall vendors and companies in testing their firewall rules and implementation to determine if they are an adequate enough defense measure to stop a real cyber-attack.

Many of the techniques that will be presented were created by Roberto Salgado and are currently some of the fastest methods of extracting information from a database through SQL Injections. Roberto will demonstrate how to reduce the amount of time it takes to exploit a SQL Injection by over a third of the time it would normally take. He will also demonstrate why firewalls and intrusion detection systems are not the ultimate solution to security and why other measurements should also be implemented.

## [Do-It-Yourself Cellular IDS](#Davidoff)

For less than $500, you can build your own cellular intrusion detection system to detect malicious activity through your own local femtocell. Our team will show how we leveraged root access on a femtocell, reverse engineered the activation process, and turned it into a proof-of-concept cellular network intrusion monitoring system.

We leveraged commercial Home Node-Bs ("femtocells") to create a 3G cellular network sniffer without needing to reimplement the UMTS or CDMA2000 protocol stacks. Inside a Faraday cage, we connected smartphones to modified femtocells running Linux distributions and redirected traffic to a Snort instance. Then we captured traffic from infected phones and showed how Snort was able to detect and alert upon malicious traffic. We also wrote our own CDMA protocol dissector in order to better analyze CDMA traffic.

## [Embedded Devices Security and Firmware Reverse Engineering](#Costin)

Embedded devices have become the "usual presence" in the network of (m)any household(s), SOHO, enterprise or critical infrastructure.

The preached Internet of Things promises to "gazillion"uple their number and heterogeneity in the next few years.

However, embedded devices are becoming lately the "usual suspects" in security breaches and security advisories and thus become the "Achilles' heel" of one's overall infrastructure security.

An important aspect is that embedded devices run on what's commonly known as firmwares.

To understand how to secure embedded devices, one needs to understand their firmware and how it works.

This workshop aims at presenting a quick-start at how to inspect firmwares and a hands-on presentation with exercises on real firmwares from a security analysis standpoint.

## [JTAGulator: Assisted discovery of on-chip debug interfaces](#Grand)

On-chip debug (OCD) interfaces can provide chip-level control of a target device and are a primary vector used by hackers to extract program code or data, modify memory contents, or affect device operation on-the-fly. Depending on the complexity of the target device, manually locating available OCD connections can be a difficult and time consuming task, sometimes requiring physical destruction or modification of the device.

In this session, Joe will introduce the JTAGulator, an open source hardware tool that assists in identifying OCD connections from test points, vias, or component pads. He will discuss traditional hardware reverse engineering methods and prior art in this field, how OCD interfaces work, and how JTAGulator can simplify the task of discovering such interfaces.

## [Methodologies for Hacking Embedded Security Appliances](#Bathurst)

Security appliances, for everything from firewalls to encrypted SAN devices are a dime a dozen these days. Vendors are throwing jargon into everything they possibly can to make the consumer believe they have the top-of-line device, with every possible feature a person could want. Everyone has heard the sales pitches, but does anyone really take the time to verify the claims, or understand how those devices function?

Weâll go in-depth on the methods we use in breaking down hardened security appliances for analysis, using real world examples where possible. We hope to point out possible failure points within the construction of a security device, so as to better educate purchasers and producers on why products fail. Weâll analyze methods of key management, cryptographic implementation, system recovery, tamper detection, interfaces, and much more.

## [Mo Malware Mo Problems - Cuckoo Sandbox to the rescue](#Guarnieri)

Cuckoo Sandbox is a widely used open-source project for automated dynamic malware analysis. It takes malicious documents or URLs as input and provides both high-level overview reports as well as detailed API call traces of the activities observed inside a virtual machine. The project was founded by Claudio Guarnieri and is mainly developed by four developers in their free time and during weekends.
Cuckoo Sandbox distinguishes from other solutions thanks to its modular design and flexible customization features. Because of this unique emphasis several large IT corporations and security companies run Cuckoo Sandbox to analyze malware samples on a daily basis and itâs often placed alongside with traditional perimeter security products as an added weapon to incident response and security teamsâ arsenals. Being open-source, it also empowers independent and academic security researchers to use a full-fledged malware analysis sandbox freely.

For the latest available version we saw more than 8000 downloads and a few hundred constantly running deployments with enabled update-checks. This community also contributes to the project in various forms such as setup instructions, code contributions, behavioral signatures, feature requests and usability feedback and is actively engaged in conversations over mailing lists and IRC.

The development team already presented about the project and conducted trainings on several occasions. However due to a wealth of new features and increased development effort, the project is growing and becoming more stable and capable in the recent times. For this reason we want to host a workshop that we designed from scratch with a completely new approach. It will showcase the tool, contain several challenging hands-on exercises with interesting malware samples and explain customization possibilities again with examples that attendees can try.
Additionally in this presentation we cover our new VM-introspection based analysis module for the first time. We intend to release it as an alternative to our userland hooking based approach in order to evade malware trying to detect us. So in the future, users can use several analysis methods and compare results to pinpoint evasion techniques.

The audience can interact and participate to the workshop with just a web browser and an SSH client.

## [PDF Attack: A Journey from the Exploit Kit to the shellcode](#Esparza)

PDF Attack: A journey from the Exploit Kit to the shellcode is a workshop to show how to analyze obfuscated Javascript code from an Exploit Kit page, extract the exploits used, and analyze them. Nowadays it is possible to use automated tools to extract URLs and binaries but it is also important to know how to do it manually to not to miss a detail. We will focus on PDF documents mostly, starting from a simple Javascript Hello World document and ending with a real file used by a fresh Exploit Kit. This workshop will also include exercises to modify malicious PDF files and obfuscate them to try to bypass AV software; very useful in pentesting. The latest version of peepdf (included in REMnux, BackTrack and Kali Linux) will be used to accomplish these tasks, so this presentation covers the latest tricks used by cybercriminals like using new filters and encryption to make analysis more difficult.

## [Practical Pentesting of ERPs and Business Applications](#Polyakov)

Today, the whole business of a company depends on enterprise business applications. They are big systems that store and process all the critical data of companies. Any information an attacker might want, be it a cybercriminal, industrial spy or competitor, is stored here. This information can include financial, customer or public relations, intellectual property, personally identifiable information, and more. Industrial espionage, sabotage and fraud or insider embezzlement may be very effective if targeted at the victimâs business application and cause significant damage to the business. There are many types of those applications: ERPs, CRMs, SRMs, ESBs. Unfortunately, there is still very little information about the security of those systems, especially how to pentest them.

During our work on OWASP-EAS subproject, we gathered top 10 critical areas (similar to most of the business applications), so we will present a solid approach for pentesting those types of systems. We will look at 3 different systems from top business application vendors: SAP, Oracle and Microsoft, and show how to pentest them using our cheatsheets that will be released for BlackHat as well as a free tool: ERPScan Pentesting Tool.

## [Abusing Web APIs Through Scripted Android Applications](#Peck)

This will be a presentation focused on abusing web application APIs through the use of associated Android apps. We'll demonstrate using the JVM based scripting language JRuby to load, modify, and run code from targeted APKs in an easily scriptable way. We'll leverage this to demonstrate attacks against web APIs that have reduced their security requirements in order to allow for a more frictionless mobile experience, such as removing the need for captchas, email validation, and other usage restrictions. Building on that, we'll show code building on the existing testing framework of Burp suite and its Ruby interface Buby to make requests to APIs using the functionality we've exposed through the scripting to find differing responses to similar requests, and identifying potential weak points. We'll conclude with several case studies of popular apps demonstrating private key retrieval, arbitrary unlimited account creation on a social network, and locating and using custom cryptographic routines in our own scripts without the need to understand their implementation.

## [Big Data for Web Application Security](#Arpaia)

The security posture of an application is directly proportional to the amount of information that is known about the application. Although the advantages of analytics from a data science perspective are well known and well documented, the advantages of analytics from a web application security perspective are neither well known nor well documented. How can we, as web application security practitioners, take advantage of big data stacks to improve the security posture of our applications? This talk will dive into the ways that big data analytics can be taken advantage of to create effective defenses for web applications today. We'll outline the fundamental problems that can and should be solved with big data and outline the classes of security mechanisms that simply, based on their nature, cannot be solved with big data. Once an understanding of the domain is established, we'll explore several specific examples that outline how one security team uses big data every day to solve hard, interesting problems and create a safer experience for its users.

## [Clickjacking Revisited: A Perceptual View of UI Security](#Akhawe)

We revisit UI security attacks (such as clickjacking) from a perceptual perspective and argue that limitations of human perception make UI security difficult to achieve. We develop five novel attacks that go beyond current UI security defenses. Our attacks are powerful with a 100% success rate in one case. However, they only scratch the surface of possible perceptual attacks on UI security. We discuss possible defenses against our perceptual attacks and find that possible defenses either have an unacceptable usability cost or do not provide a comprehensive defense. Finally, we posit that a number of attacks are possible with a more comprehensive study of human perception.

## [CMX: IEEE Clean File Metadata Exchange](#Kennedy)

False positives are a huge problem in the security space. Organizations can spend more time and engineering on reducing FPs than on detecting new malware. Whitelists can help, but there are difficulties with these. Many organizations will not permit the exchange of files for copyright reasons. 3rd party developers must deal with multiple security vendors to get their software whitelisted.

CMX is a system being operated by IEEE. 3rd party software developers can submit metadata for their applications to a single portal. Security vendor subscribers can then pull -- in realtime -- all the metadata being pushed into the system. Since only metadata is being exchanged, there are no copyright problems.

This system will greatly simplify the maintenance of global whitelists.

## [CrowdSource: An Open Source, Crowd Trained Machine Learning Model for Malware Capability Detection](#Saxe)

Due to the exploding number of unique malware binaries on the Internet and the slow process required for manually analyzing these binaries, security practitioners today have only limited visibility into the functionality implemented by the global population of malware. To date little work has been focused explicitly on quickly and automatically detecting the broad range of high level malware functionality such as the ability of malware to take screenshots, communicate via IRC, or surreptitiously operate usersâ webcams.

To address this gap, we debut CrowdSource, an open source machine learning based reverse engineering tool. CrowdSource approaches the problem of malware capability identification in a novel way, by training a malware capability detection engine on millions of technical documents from the web. Our intuition for this approach is that malware reverse engineers already rely heavily on the web âcrowdâ (performing web searches to discover the purpose of obscure function calls and byte strings, for example), so automated approaches, using the tools of machine learning, should also take advantage of this rich and as of yet untapped data source.

As a novel malware capability detection approach, CrowdSource does the following:

1. Generates a list of detected software capabilities for novel malware samples (such as the ability of malware to communicate via a particular protocol, perform a given data exfiltration activity, or load a device driver);
2. Provides traceable output for capability detections by including âcitationsâ to the web technical documents that detections are based on;
3. Provides probabilistic malware capability detections when appropriate: e.g., system output may read, âgiven the following web documents as evidence, it is 80% likely the sample uses IRC as a C2 channel, and 70% likely that it also encrypts this traffic.â

CrowdSource is funded under the DARPA Cyber Fast Track initiative, is being developed by the machine learning and malware analysis group at Invincea Labs and is scheduled for beta, open source release to the security community this October. In this presentation we will give complete details on our algorithm for CrowdSource as it stands, including compelling results that demonstrate that CrowdSource can already rapidly reverse engineer a variety of currently active malware variants.

## [Denial of Service as a Service - asymmetrical warfare at its finest](#Masse)

Imagine being DDOS'd repeatedly with up to 10Gbps of traffic on a daily basis. Your logs are useless (when your systems are even able to collect data). How do you stop the attacks? Crippling Distributed Denial of Service âAs a Serviceâ or DDoSaaS (tm) attacks can be done with $200 lifetime memberships against the largest organizations around - and almost impossible to stop. Asymmetrical warfare at its finest.

The presentation will focus on an investigation that was done in 2013 regarding a large DDOS attack against a regional ISP in Quebec, Canada. The DDOS attack affected tens of thousand of citizens including municipal 911 services (don't ask) to chicken farmers.

We'll talk about the investigative techniques (including social engineering) that were used to track down the suspect and the eventual arrest.

## [Denying service to DDOS protection services](#Nixon)

In this age of cheap and easy DDOS attacks, DDOS protection services promise to go between your server and the Internet to protect you from attackers. Cloud based DDOS protection suffers from several fundamental flaws that will be demonstrated in this talk. This was originally discovered in the process of investigating malicious websites protected by Cloudflare- but the issue also affects a number of other cloud based services including other cloud based anti-DDOS and WAF providers. We have developed a tool â called No Cloud Allowed â that will exploit this new cloud security bypass method and unmask a properly configured DDOS protected website. This talk will also discuss other unmasking methods and provide you with an arsenal to audit your cloud based DDOS or WAF protection.

## [Detecting Vulnerabilities in Virtual Devices Using Conformance Testing -- "Turning Old Hardware into Gold"](#Li)

Virtual devices are key building blocks of virtual machines. Any flaws or vulnerabilities in a virtual device directly threaten the security of the whole virtual machine. In this talk, we will present our experience detecting bugs in virtual devices by comparing a virtual device to its physical counterpart.

Since the device drivers in a guest operating system assume the virtual devices behave the same as the physical devices, any diverging behavior could potentially cause problems for the device drivers and threaten the security of the guest operating system and the virtual machine platform. We compared the QEMU/KVM virtual implementations of the e1000 and eepro100 to their physical counterparts and found multiple bugs in each, one of which was confirmed to affect guest OS security, leading to CVE-2012-6075.

Our talk will cover the basic idea of using virtual and physical device comparison for fuzzing virtual devices, and additionally describe the observability of each device type, methods for capturing device events and states, and methods for comparing between them with only partial state information. We will explain each of these steps using the real examples that led to our discovery of bugs in the e1000 and eepro100 virtual devices. We expect this talk to attract a traditional OS security audience as well as people interested in new testing methods for cloud environments.

## [Malicious File for Exploiting Forensic Software](#Haruyama)

Commercial forensic software such as EnCase, FTK and X-Ways Forensics adopts the same library component for viewing file content. If the library component is exploitable, lots of forensic investigators are exposed to risks like malware infection and freeze of the software by checking crafted malicious files.

This presentation introduces anti-forensic techniques exploiting vulnerabilities of the component embedded in forensic software. Specifically, I show one malicious file can trigger arbitrary code execution on multiple forensic software products. The exploitation has great impact on forensic investigation because most forensic software includes it.

The presentation is made up as follows. First, I explain the file viewer component in forensic software and how to fuzz it with a custom script of forensic software, MiniFuzz and a kernel driver for anti-debugging. Next, I describe two vulnerabilities (heap overflow and infinite loop DoS) detected by the fuzzer then demonstrate arbitrary code execution and hang-up of forensic software process using malicious files. I also fill in the gaps on some tricks for exploiting heap overflow (e.g., overwriting function pointers, finding the condition of heap spraying with bitmap images). Finally, I refer to countermeasures.

## [Mobile Malware: Why the traditional AV paradigm is doomed and how to use physics to detect undesirable routines](#Jakobsson)

The traditional Anti-Virus paradigm focuses on signature-based and behavioral detection. These require substantial processing, which hurts the limited power resources of handsets. Also, carriers are reluctant and slow to deliver Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) patches, due to the rigorous testing they need to subject updates to, and the costs of over-the-air updates. A move to cloud-based screening fails to recognize that not all threats will be propagated over the backbone, may obfuscate themselves in transit; or fight back (as rootkits do) to evade reporting or use of techniques such as the "Google kill switch".

Hardware vendors are evaluating security solutions with hardware support, such as TrustZone, but while this reduces the vulnerabilities, it still exposes an attack surface. Software-based attestation has been proposed by several research groups, based on various techniques that rely on the physics of the device (such as the speed of the bus, etc) to detect undesirable routines. These techniques typically require some hardware support on the devices, though, such as a trustworthy authentication (of the device to an external verifier) and a timer that cannot be manipulated by malware.

## [New Trends in FastFlux Networks](#Xu)

Fast-flux networks has been adopted by attackers for many years. Existing works only focus on characteristics such as the fast changing rate of the IP addresses (e.g. A record) and the name server addresses (NS records); the single flux/double flux structure etc. In this work, we track and analyze over 200 fast-flux domains and we discovered that the features of the fast-flux networks have shifted. More specifically, we discovered that the change rate of the IP addresses and name server addresses are slower than before, in some cases even slower than some benign applications that leverage fast-flux alike techniques. We also discovered that IP addresses and name servers are shared among different families of fast-flux domains indicating that there is a well-established under-ground economic model for the use of fast-flux network. Moreover, we also noticed that instead of single or double flux, current fast-flux domains exhibits ân-levelsâ of flux behavior, i.e., there appears to be ânâ levels of name servers in the DNS system for fast-flux domains. Finally, we also studied the benign applications that look alike fast-flux domains but not. In light of these new characteristics, we proposed several new detection approaches that capture the discoveries about the new features of fast-flux domains.

## [OPSEC failures of spies](#Cole)

The CIA is no more technologically sophisticated than your average American, and as a result, has suffered serious and embarrassing operational failures.

This is a rare peek inside the CIA's intelligence gathering operations and the stunning lack of expertise they can bring to the job.

In 2005, news organizations around the world reported that an Italian court had signed arrest warrants for 26 Americans in connection with an extraordinary rendition of a Muslim cleric. At the heart of the case was the stunning lack of OPSEC the team of spies used while they surveilled and then snatched their target off the streets of Milan.

The incident, known as the Italian Job inside the CIA, became an international scandal and caused global outrage. What very few people ever understood was that the CIA's top spies were laughably uneducated about cell phone technology and ignorant of the electronic fingerprints left behind.

The story would be startling, though old, if not for the fact that eight years after the debacle in Milan, history repeated itself.

In 2011, an entire CIA network of Lebanese informants was busted by Hezbollah. The reason: cell phone OPSEC failures. After receiving a warning from Mossad, who had lost their network a year earlier the same way, the CIA dismissed Hezbollah's ability to run analytic software on raw cell phone traffic. But they did. And with a little effort, the CIA's network of spies, as well as their own officers, were identified one by one.

This is the true story of American Intelligence's Keystone Kops.

## [Password Hashing: the Future is Now](#Aumasson)

Passwords are hashed everywhere: operating systems, smartphones, web services, disk encryption tools, SSH private keys, etc. Hashing passwords mitigates the impact of a compromised database by forcing attackers to bruteforce passwords. Bruteforce is easier when the hash function is not "salted", fast to evaluate, and easy to implement as multiple parallel instances on GPUs or multi-core systems. However existing solutions are not satisfactory, and the huge majority of systems rely on weak hashes (eg. leaks from Sony, LinkedIn, or more recently Evernote).

After a brief introduction of the problem and previous solution attempts, this talk presents a roadmap towards new improved hashing methods, as desired by a number of parties (from industry and standardization organizations).

First, we'll enumerate the technical challenges for software and security engineers as well as cryptographers and attackers, discussion questions like: why, counter-intuitively, parallelism is desirable? How can complexity theory benefit password hashing? How to define a metric that encompasses performance on GPUs and ASICs? Should hashing be performed by the client, server, or both? What about DoS induced by slow hashing? etc.

Then we'll describe the initiative that motivated this talk: the Password Hashing Competition (PHC), a project similar to the pure-cryptography competitions AES, eSTREAM, or SHA-3, but focused on the password hashing problem: the PHC gathers the leading experts from the password cracking scene as well as cryptographers and software engineers from academia, industry, as well as NIST, to develop the hashing methods of the future.

## [Shattering Illusions in Lock-Free Worlds: Compiler/Hardware Behaviors in OSes and VMs](#Blanchou)

Memory access operations in OSes, VMs or traditional applications from different threads and processes can lead to various security issues depending on the compiler/hardware - especially in non-blocking code. Compilers/hardware pretend to provide sequential order execution, and this illusion does hold for single-threaded code. However, they are not aware of which memory locations are shared and developers oftentimes make the wrong assumptions about memory models. It can be subtle to protect these memory sections from aggressive read/write re-ordering and various optimizations depending on the compiler on x86, x86-64 or the loosely ordered IA64, ARM CPUs as well as GPUs - and it can easily lead to "losing the illusion" of sequential consistency.

I will discuss common issues depending on the hardware and compiler used, mostly related to loosely ordered hardware and the C/C++11 memory models, but will also compare how they hold in higher level languages. Developers will better understand how these issues can be mitigated and researchers will be able to find them more easily.

## [TOR... ALL-THE-THINGS!](#Geffner2)

The global Tor network and its routing protocols provide an excellent framework for online anonymity. However, the selection of Tor-friendly software for Windows currently sucks.

Want to anonymously browse the web? Youâre stuck with Firefox, and donât even think about trying to anonymously use Flash.

Want to dynamically analyze malware without letting the C2 server know your home IP address? Youâre outta luck.

Want to anonymously use any program that doesnât natively support SOCKS or HTTP proxying? Not gonna happen.

While some solutions currently exist for generically rerouting traffic through Tor, these solutions either donât support Windows or require an additional network gateway device.

This talk presents a new tool to securely, anonymously, and transparently route all TCP/IP and DNS traffic through Tor, regardless of the client software, and without relying on VPNs or additional hardware or virtual machines. Black Hat 2013 will mark the release of this new Tor tool -- Tortilla!

## [Truncating TLS Connections to Violate Beliefs in Web Applications](#Smyth)

We identify logical web application flaws which can be exploited by TLS truncation attacks to desynchronize the user- and server-perspective of an application's state. It follows immediately that servers may make false assumptions about users, hence, the flaw constitutes a security vulnerability. Moreover, in the context of authentication systems, we exploit the vulnerability to launch the following practical attacks: we exploit the Helios electronic voting system to cast votes on behalf of honest voters, take full control of Microsoft Live accounts, and gain temporary access to Google accounts.

## [Untwining Twine](#Chittenden)

Over 14 years ago, Kevin Ashton was the first to coin the term "internet of things," and pointed out that data on the Internet is mostly created by humans. Things have changed considerably since 1999 - Lou Bega's Mambo No. 5 is no longer on the radio, many appliances ship with embedded systems that can be remotely monitored, and the smart home is something we're all excited for and terrified of.

Twine is a consumer device that provides remote environmental monitoring through a variety of sensors, such as moisture, temperature, vibration, etc... We will discuss our analysis of Twine, and will lead you through the steps taken to understand what's going on under the hood of a "black box" device. The audience will be introduced to the challenges faced, and to the different approaches that can be leveraged to understand (and exploit!) embedded devices (the fridge that tweets and similar devices). Topics include: capturing traffic on a non-proxy aware device, obtaining and reverse engineering the firmware, analyzing opaque binary traffic, emulating a Twine device and gaining console access via the debug serial port.

## [The Web IS Vulnerable: XSS Defense on the BattleFront](#Wroblewski)

Cross-site scripting issues remain a big problem of the web: using a combination of big data mining and relatively simple detection methods, we have identified attackers successfully exploiting XSS flaws on over 1,000 vulnerable pages on hundreds of websites, spanning multiple countries, types of organizations, all major TLDs, and well known international companies. We also found numerous malicious attacks of different severity leveraging existing XSS vulnerabilities.

In this talk first we summarize our findings, presenting both unusual cases and various statistics, and then we follow up with present state-of-the art methods of protection from probing for XSS vulnerabilities and XSS attacks, showing that they are capable of intercepting over 95% of the real-world malicious samples. We will also introduce a new research tool called detectXSSlib, which is a lightweight module for nginx server dedicated to real-time detection of XSS attacks.

Compression and Information Leakage of
Plaintext

John Kelsey, Certicom
(kelsey.j@ix.netcom.com)

1

Introduction

Cryptosystems like AES and triple-DES are designed to encrypt a sequence of
input bytes (the plaintext) into a sequence of output bytes (the ciphertext) in
such a way that the output carries no information about that plaintext except its
length. In recent years, concerns have been raised about "side-channel" attacks
on various cryptosystems{attacks that make use of some kind of leaked informa-
tion about the cryptographic operations (e.g., power consumption or timing) to
defeat them. In this paper, we describe a somewhat diﬁerent kind of side-channel
provided by data compression algorithms, yielding information about their in-
puts by the size of their outputs. The existence of some information about a
compressor’s input in the size of its output is obvious; here, we discuss ways to
use this apparently very small leak of information in surprisingly powerful ways.
The compression side-channel diﬁers from side-channels described in [Koc96]

[KSHW00] [KJY00] in two important ways:

1. It reveals information about plaintext, rather than key material.
2. It is a property of the algorithm, not the implementation. That is, any im-

plementation of the compression algorithm will be equally vulnerable.

1.1 Summary of Results

Our results are as follows:

1. Commonly-used lossless compression algorithms leak information about the
data being compressed, in the size of the compressor output. While this
would seem like a very small information leak, it can be exploited in sur-
prisingly powerful ways, by exploiting the ability of many compression algo-
rithms to adapt to the statistics of their previously-processed input data.
2. We consider the "stateless compression side-channel," based on the compres-
sion ratio of an unknown string without reference to the rest of the message’s
contents. We also consider the much more powerful "stateful compression
side-channel," based on the compression ratio of an unknown string, given
information about the rest of the message.

3. We describe a number of simple attacks based mainly on the stateless side-

channel.

4. We describe attacks to determine whether some string S appears often in a

set of messages, using the stateful side-channel.

265

5. We describe attacks to extract a secret string S that is repeated in many
compressed messages, under partial chosen plaintext assumptions, using the
stateful side-channel.

6. We consider countermeasures that can make both the stateless and the state-
ful side-channels substantially harder to exploit, and which may thus block
some of these attacks.

7. We discuss the implications of these results, in light of the widespread use of
compression with encryption, and the "folk wisdom" suggesting that adding
compression to an encryption application will increase security.

1.2 Practical Impact of Results

Compression algorithms are widely used in real-world applications, and have a
large impact on those applications’ performance in terms of speed, bandwidth
requirements, and storage requirements. For example, PGP and GPG compress
using the Zip De(cid:176)ate algorithm before encrypting, IPSec can use IPComp to
compress packets before encrypting them, and both the SSH and TLS protocols
support an option for on-the-(cid:176)y compression.

Potential security implications of using compression algorithms are of prac-
tical importance to people designing systems that might use both compression
and encryption.

The side-channel attacks described in this paper can have a practical impact
on security in many situations. However, it is important to note that these
attacks have little security impact on, say, a bulk encryption application which
compresses data before encrypting. To a ﬂrst-order approximation, the attacks in
this paper are described in decreasing order of practicality. The string-extraction
attacks are not likely to be practical against many systems, since they require
such a specialized kind of partial chosen-plaintext access. The string-detection
attacks have less stringent requirements, and so are likely to be useful against
more systems. The passive information leakage attacks are likely practical to
use against any system that uses compression and encryption together, and for
which some information about input size is available.

In a broader sense, the results in this paper point to the need to consider the
impact of any pre- or post-processing done along with encryption and authenti-
caton. For example, we have not considered timing channels from compression
algorithms in this paper, but such channels will clearly exist for some compres-
sion algorithms, and must also exist for many other kinds of processing done
on plaintext before it is sent, or ciphertext after it is received and decrypted.
Similarly, anything done to the decrypted ciphertext of a message before au-
thenticating the result is subject to reaction attacks: attacks in which changes in
the ciphertext can cause diﬁerent error messages or other behavior on the part
of the receiver, depending on some secret information that the attacker seeks to
reveal. (For decompressors which must terminate decompression with an error
for some possible inputs, for example, there are serious dangers with respect to
reaction attacks, or even with buﬁer-overrun or other related attacks.)

266

1.3 Previous Work

Although existence of the stateless compression side channel is obvious, we have
seen very little reference to it in the literature. Nearly all published works dis-
cussing compression and encryption describe how compression improves the se-
curity of encryption.

One of the attendants of FSE2002 brought [BCL02] to our attention; in this
article, researchers had noticed that they could use the compression ratio of
a ﬂle to determine the language in which it was written in. This is the same
phenomenon on which is based one of our stateless side channels.

1.4 Guide to the Paper

The remainder of this paper is arranged as follows: First, we discuss commonly-
used compression methods, and how they interact with encryption. Next, we
describe the side-channel which we will use in our attacks. We then consider
several kinds of attack, making use of this side channel. We conclude with a
discussion of various complications to the attacks, and possible defenses against
them.

2 Lossless Compression Methods and the Compression

Side-Channels

The goal of any compression algorithm (note: in this paper, we consider only
lossless compression algorithms) is to reduce the redundancy of some block of
data, so that an input that required R bits to encode can be written as an out-
put with fewer than R bits. All lossless compression algorithms work by taking
advantage of the fact that not all messages of R bits are equally likely to be
sent. These compression algorithms make a trade-oﬁ: they eﬁectively encode the
higher probability messages with fewer bits, while encoding the lower proba-
bility messages with more bits. The compression algorithms in widespread use
today typically use two assumptions to remove redundancy: They assume that
characters and strings that have appeared recently in the input are likely to
recur, and that some values (strings, lengths, and characters) are more likely to
occur than others. Using these two assumptions, these algorithms are eﬁective
at compressing a wide variety of commonly-used data formats.

Many compression algorithms (and speciﬂcally, the main one we will con-
sider here) make use of a \sliding window" of recently-seen text. Strings that
appear in the window are encoded by reference to their position in the window.
Other compression algorithms keep recently-seen strings in an easily-searched
data structure; strings that appear in that structure are encoded in an e–cient
way.

Essentially all compression algorithms make use of ways to e–ciently encode
symbols (characters, strings, lengths, dictionary entries) of unequal frequency,
so that commonly-occurring symbols are encoded using fewer bits than rarely-
occurring symbols.

267

For the purposes of this paper, it is necessary to understand three things

about these compression functions:

1. At any given point in the process of compressing a message, there are gener-
ally many diﬁerent input strings of the same length which will compress to
diﬁerent lengths. This inherently leaks information about these input strings.
2. The most generally useful compression algorithms encode the next few bytes
of input in diﬁerent ways (and to diﬁerent lengths), depending on recently-
seen inputs.

3. While a single \pass" of a compression algorithm over a string can leak only
a small amount of data about that string, multiple \passes" with diﬁerent
data appearing before that string can leak a great deal of data about that
string.

This summary necessarily omits a lot of detail about how compression al-
gorithms work. For a more complete introduction to the techniques used in
compression algorithms, see [Sal97a] or [CCF01a].

2.1

Interactions with Encryption

Essentially all real-world ciphers output data with no detectable redundancy.
This means that ciphertext won’t compress, and so if a system is to beneﬂt from
compression, it must compress the information before it is encrypted.

The \folk wisdom" in the cryptographic community is that adding compres-
sion to a system that does encryption adds to the security of the system, e.g.,
makes it less likely that an attacker might learn anything about the data be-
ing encrypted. This belief is generally based on concerns about unicity distance,
keysearch di–culty, or ability of known- or chosen-plaintext attacks. We believe
that this folk wisdom, though often repeated in a variety of sources, is not gener-
ally true; adding compression to a competently designed encryption system has
little real impact on its security. We base this on three observations:

Unicity distance is irrelevant. The unicity distance of an encryption system
is the number of bits of ciphertext an attacker must see before he has enough
information that it is even theoretically possible to determine the key. Com-
pression algorithms, decreasing the redundancy of plaintexts, clearly increase
unicity distance. However, this is irrelevant for practical encryption systems,
where a single 128-bit key can be expected to encrypt millions of bytes of
plaintext.

Keysearch di–culty is only slightly increased. Since most export restric-
tions on key lengths have gone away, we can expect this to become less and
less relevant over time, as existing ﬂelded algorithms with 40- and 56-bit
key lengths are replaced with triple-DES or AES. At any rate, for systems
with keys short enough for brute force searching, adding general-purpose
compression algorithms to the system seems like a singularly unhelpful way
to ﬂx the problem. Standard compression algorithms usually include ﬂxed
headers, and tend to be pretty predictable in their ﬂrst few bytes of output.

268

It seems unlikely that adding such a compression algorithm, even with ﬂxed
headers removed, increases the di–culty of keysearch by more than a factor
of 10 to 100. Switching to a stronger cipher is a far cheaper solution that
actually solves the problem.

Standard algorithms not that helpful. Compression with some additional
features to support security (such as a randomized initial state) can make
known-plaintext attacks against block ciphers much harder. However, oﬁ-
the-shelf compression algorithms provide little help against known-plaintext
attacks (since an attacker who knows the compression algorithm and the
plaintext knows the compressor output). And while chosen-plaintext attacks
can be made much harder by specially designed compression algorithms,
they are also made much harder, at far lower cost, by the use of standard
chaining modes.

In summary, compression algorithms add very little security to well-designed
encryption systems. Such systems use keys long enough to resist keysearch at-
tack and chaining modes that resist chosen-plaintext attack. The real reason for
using compression algorithms isn’t to increase security, but rather to save on
bandwidth and storage. As we will disucuss below, this real advantage needs
to be balanced against a (mostly academic) risk of attacks on the system, such
as those described below, based on information leakage from the compression
algorithm.

3 The Compression Side-Channel and our Attack Model

In this section, we describe the compression side channel in some detail. We also
consider some situations in which this side channel might leak important data.
Any lossless compression algorithm must compress diﬁerent messages by dif-
ferent amounts, and indeed must expand some possible messages. The compres-
sion side channel we consider in this paper is simply the diﬁerent amount by
which diﬁerent messages are compressed. When an unknown string S is com-
pressed, and an attacker sees the input and output sizes, he has almost certainly
learned only a very small amount about S. For almost any S, there will be a
large set of alternative messages of the same length, which would also have had
the same size of compressor output. Even so, some small amount of information
is leaked by even this minimal side-channel. For example, an attacker informed
that a ﬂle of 1MB had compressed to 1KB has learned that the original ﬂle must
have been extremely redundant.

Fortunately (for cryptanalysts, at least), compression algorithms such as
LZW and Zip De(cid:176)ate adapt to the data they are fed. (The same is true of many
other compression algorithms, such as adaptive markov coding and Burrows-
Wheeler coding, and even adaptive Huﬁman coding of symbols.) As a message
is processed, the state of the compressor is altered in a predictable way, so that
strings of symbols that have appeared earlier in the message will be encoded more
e–ciently than strings of symbols that have not yet appeared in the message.
This allows an enormously more powerful side-channel when the unknown string

269

S is compressed with many known or chosen preﬂx strings, P0; P1; :::; Pn¡1. Each
preﬂx can put the compressor into a diﬁerent state, allowing new information
to be extracted from the compressor output size in each case. Similarly, if a
known or chosen set of su–xes, Q0; Q1; :::; Qn¡1 is appended to the unknown
string S before compression, the compressor output sizes that result will each
carry a slightly diﬁerent piece of information about S, because those su–xes
with many strings in common with S will compress better than other su–xes,
with fewer strings in common with S. This can allow an attacker to reconstruct
all of S with reasonably high probability, even when the compressor output sizes
for diﬁerent preﬂxes or su–xes diﬁer only by a few bytes. In this situation, it is
quite possible for an attacker to rule out all incorrect values of S given enough
input and output sizes for various preﬂxes, along with knowledge or control over
the preﬂx values. Further, an attacker can build information about S gradually,
reﬂning a partial guess when the results of each successive compressor output
are seen.

A related idea can be used against a system that compresses and encrypts,
but does not strongly authenticate its messages. The eﬁect of altering a few bytes
of plaintext (through a ciphertext alteration) will be very much dependent on
the state of the decompressor both before and after the altered plaintext bytes
are processed. The kind of control exerted over the compressor state is diﬁerent,
but the impact is similar. However, we do not consider this class of attack in
this paper.

3.1 Assumptions and Models

We will make the following assumptions in the remainder of this paper:

1. Each message is processed by ﬂrst compressing it, then encrypting it.
2. The attacker can learn the precise compressor output length from the ci-

phertext.

3. The attacker somehow knows the precise input length, or (in some cases) at

least the approximate input length.

In the sections that follow, we will consider three basic classes of attacks:
First, we will consider purely passive attacks, where the attacker simply observes
the ciphertext length and compression ratio, and learns information that should
have been concealed by the encryption mechanism. Second, we will consider
a kind of limited chosen-plaintext attack, in which the attacker attempts to
determine whether and approximately how often some string appears in a set
of messages. Third, we will consider a much more demanding kind of chosen-
plaintext attack, in which the attacker must make large numbers of chosen or
adaptive-chosen plaintext queries, in hopes of extracting a whole secret string.

4 Data Information Leakage

In this section, we consider purely passive attacks; ways that an attacker can
learn some information he should not be able to learn, by merely observing

270

the ciphertexts and corresponding compression ratio. One general property of
these attacks is that they are quite hard to avoid, without simply eliminating
compression from the system. However, it is also worth noting that most of these
attacks are not particularly devastating under most circumstances.

4.1 Highly Redundant Data

Consider a large ﬂle full of binary zeros or some other very repetitive contents.
Encrypting this under a block cipher in ECB-mode would reveal a lot of re-
dundancy; this is one reason why well-designed encryption systems use block
ciphers in one of the chaining modes. Using CBC- or CFB-mode, the encrypted
ﬂle would reveal nothing about the redundancy of the plaintext ﬂle.

Compressing before encryption changes this behavior. Now, a highly-redundant

ﬂle will compress extremely well. The very small ciphertext will be su–cient,
given knowledge of the original input size, to inform an attacker that the plain-
text was highly redundant.

We note that this information leak is not likely to be very important for most

systems. However:

1. Chaining modes prevent this kind of information leakage, and this is, in fact,

one very good reason to use chaining modes with block ciphers.

2. In some situations, leaking the fact that highly-redundant data is being
transmitted may leak some very important information. (An example might
be a compressed, encrypted video feed from a surveilance camera{an attacker
could watch the bandwidth consumed by the feed, and determine whether
the motion of his assistant trying to get past the camera had been detected.)

4.2 Leaking File or Data Types

Diﬁerent data formats compress at diﬁerent ratios. A large ﬂle containing ASCII-
encoded English text will compress at a very diﬁerent ratio from a large ﬂle
containing a Windows executable ﬂle. Given knowledge only of the compression
ratio, an attacker can thus infer something about the kind of data being trans-
mitted. This is not so trivial, and may be relevant in some special circumstances.
This may be resisted by encoding the data to be transmitted in some other

format, at the cost of losing some of the advantage of compression.

4.3 Compression Ratio as a Checksum

Consider a situation where an attacker knows that one of two diﬁerent known
messages of equal length is to be sent. (For example, the two message might
be something like "DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN!" or "TRUMAN DEFEATS
DEWEY!".) If these two messages have diﬁerent compression ratios, the attacker
can determine precisely which message was sent. (For this example, Python’s
ZLIB compresses "TRUMAN DEFEATS DEWEY!" slightly better than "DEWEY
DEFEATS TRUMAN!")

271

More generally, if the attacker can enumerate the set of possible input mes-
sages, and he knows the compression algorithm, he can use the length of the
input, plus the compression ratio, as a kind of checksum. This is a very straight-
forward instance of the side-channel; an attacker is able, by observing compres-
sion ratios, to rule out a subset of possible plaintexts.

4.4 Looped Input Streams

Sometimes, an input stream may be \looped," so that after R bytes, the message
begins repeating. This is the sort of pattern that encryption should mask, and
without compression, using a standard chaining mode will mask it. However, if
the compression ratio is visible to an attacker, he will often be able to determine
whether or not the message is looping, and may sometimes be able to determine
its approximate period.

There are two ways the information can leak. First, if the period of the looping
is shorter than the \sliding window" of an LZ77-type compression algorithm, the
compression ratio will suddenly become very good. Second, if the period is longer
than the sliding window, the compression ratios will start precisely repeating.
(Using an LZW-type scheme will leave the compression ratios improving each
time through the repeated data, until the dictionary ﬂlls up.)

5 String Presence Detection Attacks

The most widely used lossless compression algorithms adapt to the patterns in
their input, so that when those patterns are repeated, those repetitions can be
encoded very e–ciently. This allows a whole class of attacks to learn whether
some string S is present within a sequence of compressed and encrypted mes-
sages, based on using either known input data (some instances where S is known
to have appeared in messages) or chosen input (where S may be appended to
some messages before they’re compressed and encrypted).

All the attacks in this section require knowledge or control of some part of
a set of messages, and generally also some knowledge of the kind of data being
sent. They also all require knowledge of either inputs or compressor outputs, or
in some cases, compression ratios.

5.1 Detecting a Document or Long String with Partial Chosen

Plaintext

The attacker wants to determine whether some long string S appears often in a
set of messages M0; M1; :::; MN ¡1.

The simplest attack is as follows:

1. The attacker gets the compressed, encrypted versions of all of the Mi. From

this he learns their compressed output lengths.

272

2. The attacker requests the compressed, encrypted versions of M 0

i = Mi; S,
for all Mi. That is, he requests the compressed and encrypted results of
appending S to each message.

3. The attacker determines the length of S after compression with the scheme

in use.

4. The attacker observes M 0

i ¡ Mi. If these values average substantially less
than the expected length of S after compression, it is very likely that S is
present in many of these messages.

5.2 Partial Known Input Attack

A much more demanding and complicated attack may be possible, given only
the leakage of some information from each of a set of messages. The attacker can
look for correlations between the appearance of substrings of S in the known part
of each message, and the compressed length of the message; based on this, he can
attempt to determine whether S appears often in those messages. This attack
is complicated by the fact that the appearance of substrings of S in the known
part of the message may be correlated with the presence of S in the message.
(Whether it is correlated or not requires more knowledge about how the messages
are being generated, and the speciﬂc substrings involved. For example, if S is
\global thermonuclear war", the appearance of the substring \thermonuclear"
is almost certainly correlated with the appearance of S later in the message.)

A more useful version of an attack like this might be a case where several ﬂles
are being combined into an archive and compressed, and the attacker knows one
of the ﬂles. Assuming the other ﬂles aren’t chosen in some way that correlates
their contents with the contents of the known ﬂle, the attacker can safely run
the attack.

6 String Extraction Attacks

In this section, we consider ways an attacker might use the compression side
channel to extract some secret string from the compressor inputs. This kind
of attack requires rather special conditions, and so is much less practical than
the other attacks considered above. However, in some special situations, these
attacks could be made to work. More importantly, these attacks demonstrate a
separate path for attacking systems, despite the use of very strong encryption.
The general setting of these attacks is as follows: The system being attacked
has some secret string, S, which is of interest to the attacker. The attacker is
permitted to build a number of requested plaintexts, each using S, without ever
knowing S. For example, the attacker may choose a set of N preﬂxes, P0;1;:::;N ¡1,
and request N messages, where the ith message is PijjS.

6.1 An Adaptive Chosen Input Attack

Our ﬂrst attack is an adaptive chosen input attack. We make a guess about the
contents of the ﬂrst few characters of the secret string, and make a set of queries

273

based on this guess. The output lengths of the results of these queries should be
smaller for correct guesses than for incorrect guesses.

We construct our queries in the form

Query = preﬂx + guess + ﬂller + preﬂx + S

where

Query is the string which the target of the attack is convinced to compress and

encrypt.

preﬂx is a string that is known not to occur in S.
ﬂller is another string known not to occur in S, and with little in common with

pref ix.

S is the string to be recovered by the attacker.

The idea behind this attack is simple: Suppose the preﬂx is 8 characters
long, and the guess is another 4 characters long. A correct guess guarantees that
the query string contains a repeated 12-character substring; a good compression
algorithm (and particularly, a compression scheme based on a sliding window,
like Zip De(cid:176)ate) will encode this more e–ciently than queries with incorrect
guesses, which will contain a string with slightly less redundancy. When we have
a good guess, this attack can be iterated to guess another four digits, and so on,
until all of S has been guessed.

Experimental Results We implemented this attack using the Python Zlib
package, which provides access to the widely-used Zip De(cid:176)ate compression al-
gorithm. The search string was a 16-digit PIN, and the guesses were four (and
later ﬂve) digits each. Our results were mixed: it was possible to ﬂnd the correct
PIN using this attack, but we often would have to manually make the decision to
backtrack after a guess. There were several interesting complications that arose
in implementing the attack:

1. The compression algorithm is a variant of a sliding-window scheme, in which
it is not always guaranteed that the longest match in the window will be
used to encode a string. More importantly, this is a two-pass algorithm; the
encoding of strings within the sliding window is aﬁected by later strings as
well as earlier ones, and this can change the output length enough to change
which next four digits appear to be the best match to S[Whi02].

2. Some guesses themselves compress very well. For example, the guess \0000"

compresses quite well the ﬂrst time it occurs.

3. The actual \signal" between two close guesses (e.g., \1234" and \1235") is

very close, and is often swamped by the \noise" described above.

4. To make the attack work reasonably well, it is necessary to make each piece
of the string guessed pretty long. For our implementation, ﬂve digits worked
reasonably well.

5. Some backtracking is usually necessary, and the attack doesn’t always yield

a correct solution.

274

6. It turns out to also be helpful to add some padding at the end of the string,

to keep the processing of the digits uniform.

All of these problems appear to be pretty easy to solve given more queries
and more work. However, we dealt with them more directly by developing a
diﬁerent attack|one that requires only chosen-plaintext access, not adaptive
chosen plaintext access.

6.2 A Chosen Input Attack

The adaptive chosen input attack seems so restrictive that it is hard to see how
it might be extended to a simple chosen or known plaintext attack. However,
we can use a related, but diﬁerent approach, which gives us a straightforward
chosen input attack.

The attack works in two phases:

1. Generate a list of all possible subsequences of the string S, and use the
compression side-channel to put them in approximate order of likelihood of
appearing in S.

2. Piece together the subsequences that ﬂt end-to-end, and use this to recon-

struct a set of likely candidate values for S.

The subsequences can be tested in the simplest sense by making queries of

the form

Query = Guess + S

However, to avoid interaction between the guess and the ﬂrst characters of

S, it is useful to include some ﬂller between them.

Experimental Results We were able to implement this attack, with about a
70% success rate for pseudorandomly-generated strings S of 16 digits each, using
the Python Zlib. The attack generates a list of the 20 top candidates for S, and
we counted it as a success if any of those 20 candidates was S.

There were several tricks we discovered in implementing this attack:

1. In building the queries, it was helpful to generate padding strings before
the guessed subsequence, between the guess and the string S, and after the
string.

2. It was very helpful to generate several diﬁerent padding strings, of diﬁerent
lengths, and to sum the lengths of the compressed strings resulting from
several queries of the same guess. This tended to average out some of the
\noise" of the compression algorithm.

3. There are pathological strings that cause the attack to fail. For example,
the string \0000000123000000" will tend to end up with guesses that piece
together instances of \00000".

275

7 Caveats and Countermeasures

The attacks described above make a number of simplifying assumptions. In this
section, we will discuss some of those assumptions, and the implications for our
attacks when the assumptions turn out to be false. We will also consider some
possible countermeasures.

7.1 Obscuring the Compressor Input Size

The precise size of the input may be obscured in some cases. Naturally, some
kind of information about relative compression ratios is necessary for the attack
to work. However, approximate input information will often be good enough, as
when the compression ratio is being used as the side channel. An approximate
input size will lead to an approximate compression ratio, but for any reasonably
large input, the diﬁerence between the approximate and exact compression ratios
will be too small to make any diﬁerence for the attack.

One natural way for an attacker to learn approximate input size is for the
process generating the input to the compressor to have either some known con-
stant rate of generating input, or to have its operations be visible (e.g., because
it must wait for the next input, which may be observed, before generating the
next output).

7.2 Obscuring the Compressor Output Size

Some encryption modes may automatically pad the compresor output to the
next full block for the block cipher being used. Others may append random
padding to resist this or other attacks. For example, some standard ways of
doing CBC-mode encryption include padding to the next full cipher block, and
making the last byte of the padding represent the total number of bytes of
padding used. This gives the attacker a function of the compressor output size,
d(len+1)=blocksizee£blocksize. These may slightly increase the amount of work
done during our attacks, but don’t really block any of the attacks.

A more elaborate countermeasure is possible. A system designer may decide
to reduce the possible leakage through the compressor to one bit per message,
as follows:

1. Decide on a compression ratio that is acceptable for nearly all messages, and

is also attainable for nearly all messages.

2. Send the uncompressed version of any messages that don’t attain the desired

compression ratio.

3. Pad out the compressor output of messages that get at least the desired com-
pression ratio, so that the message eﬁectively gets the desired compression
ratio.

This is an eﬁective countermeasure against some of our attacks (for example,
it makes it quite hard to determine which ﬂle type that compresses reasonably

276

well has been sent), but it does so at the cost of losing some compression per-
formance. Against our chosen-input attacks, this adds a moderate amount of
di–culty, but doesn’t provide a complete defense.

7.3 Obscuring the Compressor Internal State

It is possible to obscure the internal state of the compressor, in a number of
simple ways, including initializing the compressor in a random state, or inserting
occasional random blocks of text during the compression operation. In either
case, this can cause problems with some of our attacks, because of the lack of
precise information about the state of the compressor when an unknown string is
being processed. General compression ratios are unlikely to be aﬁected strongly
by such countermeasures, however, so the general side channel remains open.

7.4 Preprocessing the Text

The text may be preprocessed in such a way that compression is aﬁected in a
somewhat unpredictable way. For example, it is easy to design a very weak stream
cipher, which generates a keystream with extremely low Hamming weight. Ap-
plying this kind of stream cipher to the input before compression would degrade
the compression slightly, in a way not known ahead of time by any attacker.
By allowing the Hamming weight of the keystream to be tunable, we could get
tunable degradation to the compression.

8 Conclusions

In this paper, we have described a side-channel in widely-used lossless compres-
sion algorithms, which permit an attacker to learn some information about the
compressor input, based only on the size of the compressor output and whatever
additional information about other parts of the input may be available.

We have discussed only a small subset of the available compression algo-
rithms, and only one possible side channel (compression ratio). Some interesting
directions for future research include:

1. Timing side-channels for compression algorithms.
2. Attacking other lossless compression algorithms, such as adaptive Huﬁman
encoding, adaptive Markov coders, and Burrows-Wheeler block sorting (with
move-to-front and Huﬁman or Shannon-Fano coding) with this side channel.
Adaptive Huﬁman and Markov coders can be attacked using techniques very
similar to the ones described above. Burrows-Wheeler block sorting appears
to require rather diﬁerent techniques, though the same side channels clearly
exist and can be exploited.

3. Attacking lossy compression algorithms for image, sound, and other data

with this side channel.

277

4. Attacking lossy image compression by trying to use disclosed parts of a
compressed image to learn undisclosed parts of the same image, as might be
useful for redacted scanned documents.

5. Reaction attacks against decompressors, such as might be useful when a sys-
tem cryptographically authenticates plaintext, then compresses and encrypts
it. This might lead either to software faults (a change in ciphertext leading
to a buﬁer overrun, for example) or to more general leakage of information
about the encryption algorithm or plaintext.

# breach-mitigation-rails

Makes Rails 3 and 4 applications less susceptible to the BREACH /
CRIME attacks. See [breachattack.com](http://breachattack.com/) for
details.

## How it works

This gem implements two of the suggestion mitigation strategies from
the paper:

*Masking Secrets*: The Rails CSRF token is 'masked' by encrypting it
with a 32-byte one-time pad, and the pad and encrypted token are
returned to the browser, instead of the "real" CSRF token. This only
protects the CSRF token from an attacker; it does not protect other
data on your pages (see the paper for details on this).

*Length Hiding*: The BreachMitigation::LengthHiding middleware
appends an HTML comment up to 2k in length to the end of all HTML
documents served by your app. As noted in the paper, this does not
prevent plaintext recovery, but it can slow the attack and it's
relatively inexpensive to implement. Unlike the CSRF token masking,
length hiding protects the entire page body from recovery.

## Warning!

BREACH and CRIME are **complicated and wide-ranging attacks**, and this
gem offers only partial protection for Rails applications. If you're
concerned about the security of your web app, you should review the
BREACH paper and look for other, application-specific things you can
do to prevent or mitigate this class of attacks.

## Installation

Add this line to your Rails Gemfile:

```
gem 'breach-mitigation-rails'

```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle

```

The length-hiding can be disabled by doing:

```
Rails.application.config.exclude_breach_length_hiding = true

```

For most Rails apps, that should be enough, but read on for the gory
details...

## Gotchas

* The length-hiding middleware adds random text (in the form of an HTML
  comment) to every page you serve. This can break HTTP caching / ETags for
  public pages since they are no longer identical on each request.
* The length-hiding middleware adds up to 2k of text to each page you
  serve, which means more bandwidth consumed and potentially slower
  performance.
* If you have overridden the verified\_request? method in your
  application (likely in ApplicationController) you may need to update
  it to be compatible with the secret masking code. See
  `lib/breach_mitigation/railtie.rb` for an example.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, either to enhance the existing mitigation
strategies or to add new ways to mitigate against the attack.

The CRIME attack taught us that using compression can endanger confidentiality. In particular, it is dangerous to concatenate attacker-supplied data with sensitive secret data and then compress and encrypt the concatenation; any time we see that occurring, at any layer of the system stack, we should be suspicious of the potential for CRIME-like attacks.

Now the CRIME attack, at least as it has been publicly described so far, is an attack on TLS compression. Background: TLS includes a built-in compression mechanism, which happens at the TLS level (the entire connection is compressed). Thus, we have a situation where attacker-supplied data (e.g., the body of a POST request) gets mixed with secrets (e.g., cookies in the HTTP headers), which is what enabled the CRIME attack.

However there are also other layers of the system stack that may use compression. I am thinking especially of [HTTP compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression). The HTTP protocol has built-in support for compressing any resources that you download over HTTP. When HTTP compression is enabled, compression is applied to the body of the response (but not the headers). HTTP compression will be enabled only if both the browser and the server support it, but most browsers and [many servers](http://www.port80software.com/surveys/top1000compression/) do, because [it improves performance](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#gzip). Note that HTTP compression is a *different mechanism* from TLS compression; HTTP compression is negotiated at a higher level of the stack, and only applies to the body of the response. However, HTTP compression can be applied to data that is downloaded over a SSL/TLS connection, i.e., to resources downloaded via HTTPS.

My question: Is HTTP compression safe to use, on HTTPS resources? Do I need to do something special to disable HTTP compression of resources that are accessed over HTTPS? Or, if HTTP compression is somehow safe, why is it safe?

It seems risky to me. HTTP compression is fine for static resources, but for some dynamic resources served over SSL, it seems like HTTP compression might be dangerous. It looks to me like HTTP compression can, in some circumstances, allow for CRIME-like attacks.

Consider a web application that has a dynamic page with the following characteristics:

1. It is served over HTTPS.
2. HTTP compression is supported by the server (this page will be sent to the browser in compressed form, if the browser supports HTTP compression).
3. The page has a CSRF token on it somewhere. The CSRF token is fixed for the lifetime of the session (say). This is the secret that the attack will try to learn.
4. The page contains some dynamic content that can be specified by the user. For simplicity, let us suppose that there is some URL parameter that is echoed directly into the page (perhaps with some HTML escaping applied to prevent XSS, but that is fine and will not deter the attack described).

Then I think CRIME-style attacks might allow an attacker to learn the CSRF token and mount CSRF attacks on the web site.

Let me give an example. Suppose the target web application is a banking website on `www.bank.com`, and the vulnerable page is `https://www.bank.com/buggypage.html`. Suppose the bank ensures that the banking stuff is only accessible by SSL (https). And, suppose that if the browser visits `https://www.bank.com/buggypage.html?name=D.W.`, then the server will respond with a HTML document looking something vaguely like this:

```
<html>...<body>
Hi, D.W.!  Pleasure to see you again.  Some actions you can take:
<a href="/closeacct&csrftoken=29238091">close my account</a>,
<a href="/viewbalance&csrftoken=...">view my balance</a>, ...
</body></html>

```

Suppose you are browsing the web over an open Wifi connection, so that an attacker can eavesdrop on all of your network traffic. Suppose that you are currently logged into your bank, so your browser has an open session with your bank's website, but you're not actually doing any banking over the open Wifi connection. Suppose moreover that the attacker can lure you to visit the attacker's website `http://www.evil.com/` (e.g., maybe by doing a man-in-the-middle attack on you and redirecting you when you try to visit some other http site).

Then, when your browser visits `http://www.evil.com/`, that page can trigger cross-domain requests to your bank's website, in an attempt to learn the secret CSRF token. Notice that Javascript is allowed to make cross-domain requests. The same-origin policy does prevent it from seeing the response to a cross-domain request. Nonetheless, since the attacker can eavesdrop on the network traffic, the attacker can observe the length of all encrypted packets and thus infer something about the length of the resources that are being downloaded over the SSL connection to your bank.

In particular, the malicious `http://www.evil.com/` page can trigger a request to `https://www.bank.com/buggypage.html?name=closeacct&csrftoken=1` and look at how well the resulting HTML page compresses (by eavesdropping on the packets and looking at the length of the SSL packet from the bank). Next, it can trigger a request to `https://www.bank.com/buggypage.html?name=closeacct&csrftoken=2` and see how well the response compresses. And so on, for each possibility for the first digit of the CSRF token. One of those should compress a little bit better than the others: the one where the digit in the URL parameter matches the CSRF token in the page. This allows the attacker to learn the first digit of the CSRF token.

In this way, it appears that the attacker can learn each digit of the CSRF token, recovering them digit-by-digit, until the attacker learns the entire CSRF token. Then, once the attacker knows the CSRF token, he can have his malicious page on `www.evil.com` trigger a cross-domain request that contains the appropriate CSRF token -- successfully defeating the bank's CSRF protections.

It seems like this may allow an attacker to mount a successful CSRF attack on web applications, when the conditions above apply, if HTTP compression is enabled. The attack is possible because we are mixing secrets with attacker-controlled data into the same payload, and then compressing and encrypting that payload.

If there are other secrets that are stored in dynamic HTML, I could imagine that similar attacks might become possible to learn those secrets. This is just one example of the sort of attack I am thinking of. So, it seems to me that using HTTP compression on dynamic pages that are accessed over HTTPS is a bit risky. There might be good reasons to disable HTTP compression on all resources served over HTTPS, except for static pages/resources (e.g., CSS, Javascript).

* Your last line about leaving HTTP compression on for static resources (CSS/JS), even over HTTPS, makes this more palatable. As long as you aren't doing any tricky file handling and seeing that the static output is not affected by the input it should be safe.

* If the content that can be injected by the attacker is included in the page unescaped, this is comprehensible. But most secure web apps already escape user input (else there's another possible attack, like XSS). So when the secret has some special characters around it (`"` or `&`), then this should be near-impossible because the included escaped input won't be the same as the plain secret. And trying to find the secret without any surrounding pattern is a lot harder because you'd have to start with a batch of characters instead of trying them one by one. Is my understanding correct?

* @ygoe, no, I doubt it. XSS prevention often doesn't escape `&`. If it does, I suspect the same attack should work with if `evil.com` triggers a request to `https://www.bank.com/buggypage.html?name=csrftoken=1`.

* At least in ASP.NET Core MVC the CSRF token is surrounded by quotes, and some more quotes away from a recognisable code pattern (the field name); and all quotes are always escaped when printed in the page, no matter where (content or input/textarea value). I verified this in my app.

Compression, in general, alters the length of that which is compressed (that's exactly why we compress). [Lossless compression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression) alters the length *depending on the data itself* (whereas lossy compression can reach a fixed compression ratio, e.g. an MP3 file at a strict 128 kbit/s). Data length is what leaks through encryption, which is why we are interested in it.

In a very generic way, a length leak *can* be fatal, even in the presence of a passive-only attacker; it is a kind of [traffic analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis). An example is from World War I, where French cryptographers could predict the importance of a message based on the length of the (encrypted) header: an important message was sent to the colonel (*Oberst*) whereas less important messages where tagged for a lieutenant (*Oberleutnant*, a much longer term).

Compression makes length leaks only worse, because it prevents you from fixing the length leaks by normalizing the lengths of the messages.

When the attacker can add some data of his own in the chunks which are compressed, he *amplifies* the length leak, which can be become a practical attack vector for arbitrary target data, as the CRIME attack demonstrates. However, I argue that the problem was already there. In that view, HTTP-level compression is not a new risk; it is rather an aggravating factor to a pre-existing risk. Letting the attacker add some of his own data in the encrypted stream is yet another aggravating factor, and these factors add up.

---

I wager that you are not the first one to have this idea. Not only did quite a lot of people (me included) gave some thought to it in the last 10 days, but if you try to access this URL:

```
http://www.google.com/sdfdfskfdjsdfhfkjsbkfbsjksalakjsflfa

```

then you get a 404 error from Google, which contains the "sdfdfskfdjsdfhfkjsbkfbsjksalakjsflfa" word. Hey, that's attacker chosen reflected data, that could be fun ! So let's try again with a HTTPS URL:

```
https://www.google.com/sdfdfskfdjsdfhfkjsbkfbsjksalakjsflfa

```

and then, no 404, no fun, you are unceremoniously redirected to Google's home page. This makes me thinks that some people at Google already thought of it, too, and proactively deactivated the reflection bit when using SSL (because when using SSL, you get the Google+ bells and whistles, hence potentially dangerous data).

  Would adding a random number of padding bytes in the payload help? Assuming the padding bytes themselves were generated by a cryptographically secure RNG, such that they're unlikely to be compressed, I'd imagine it'd make the attack *much* harder to pull off reliably.

  @Polynomial: it can help a bit, but you have to add a substantial number of such bytes. If you add an average of *n* bytes (with a gaussian distribution), then the attacker must do about *n^2* as many requests to cancel the effect of your padding. So we are talking about adding at least 1 kB of random padding -- it seems more efficient (for both CPU and network) to disable compression for non-static content.

  @Polynomial: I don't trust numbers less than 1 million to be "high enough". We use computers with CPU in the *gigahertz* range, and networks which transmits several *megabytes* per second. Remember that the attacker can often afford to be patient.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=995168#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-08 17:22:35 UTC  ``` Angelo Prado, Neal Harris and Yoel Gluck reported [1],[2] that SSL/TLS attacks are still viable via a "BREACH" (Browser Reconnaissance & Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext) attack, which they describe as:  While CRIME was mitigated by disabling TLS/SPDY compression (and by modifying gzip to allow for explicit separation of compression contexts in SPDY), BREACH attacks HTTP responses. These are compressed using the common HTTP compression, which is much more common than TLS-level compression. This allows essentially the same attack demonstrated by Duong and Rizzo, but without relying on TLS-level compression (as they anticipated).  BREACH is a category of vulnerabilities and not a specific instance affecting a specific piece of software. To be vulnerable, a web application must:  * Be served from a server that uses HTTP-level compression * Reflect user-input in HTTP response bodies * Reflect a secret (such as a CSRF token) in HTTP response bodies  It is important to note that the attack is agnostic to the version of TLS/SSL, and does not require TLS-layer compression. Additionally, the attack works against any cipher suite. Against a stream cipher, the attack is simpler; the difference in sizes across response bodies is much more granular in this case. If a block cipher is used, additional work must be done to align the output to the cipher text blocks.   CERT has an entry describing the flaw as well [3].  Currently no CVE is assigned as MITRE is attempting to determine whether one CVE will suffice, or whether it will require multiple CVEs (one per affected product). [4]  Mitigations are noted by the researchers as follows  1. Disable HTTP compression. 2. Separate the secrets from the user input. 3. Randomize the secrets in each client request. 4. Mask secrets (effectively randomizing by XORing with a random secret per request). 5. Protect web pages from CSRF attacks. 6. Obfuscate the length of web responses by adding random amounts of arbitrary bytes.

As noted in Novell's bug report [1] we need to look at mod_deflate, probably mod_gzip, and Accept-* headers in case PHP is doing output compression (the same would likely go for other languages).

## BREACH vulnerability in compressed HTTPS

#### Vulnerability Note VU#987798

Original Release Date: 2013-08-02 | Last Revised: 2013-08-08

---

### Overview

By observing the length of compressed HTTPS responses, an attacker may be able to derive plaintext secrets from the ciphertext of an HTTPS stream.

### Description

| Angelo Prado of Salesforce.com reports:  *Extending the* [*CRIME vulnerability*](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-4929) *presented at Ekoparty 2012, an attacker can target HTTPS responses to recover data from the response body.**While the CRIME attack is currently believed to be mitigated by disabling TLS/SSL/level compression, compressed HTTP responses represent a significant unmitigated vector which is currently exploitable. By injecting plaintext into an HTTPS request, an attacker can learn information about the corresponding HTTPS response by measuring its size.**This relies on the attacker being able to observe the size of the cipher text received by the browser while triggering a number of strategically crafted requests to a target site. To recover a particular secret in an HTTPS response body, the attacker guesses character by character, sending a pair of requests for each guess. The correct guess will result in a smaller HTTPS response. For each guess the attacker coerces the victim's browser to issue two requests. The first request includes a payload of the form:**"target\_secret\_name=<already known part of secret>+<guess>+<padding>"* *...while the second request includes a payload of the form:* *"target\_secret\_name=<already known part of secret>+<padding>+<guess>".* *If the size of the first response is smaller than the second response, this indicates that the guess has a good chance of being correct. This method of sending two similar requests and comparing them is due to* [*Duong and Rizzo*](http://www.infoworld.com/sites/infoworld.com/files/pdfe/BEAST_Duong_Rizzo.pdf)*. If multiple candidates are found, the following is a useful recovery mechanism: move forward in parallel with both candidates until it becomes clear which guess is correct.* *With a token of length 32 and a character space of size 16 (e.g. hex), the attacker needs an average of approximately 1,000 request if no recovery mechanisms are needed. In practice, we have been able to recover CSRF tokens with fewer than 4,000 requests. A browser like Google Chrome or Internet Explorer is able to issue this number of requests in under 30 seconds, including callbacks to the attacker command & control center.*[In order to conduct the attack, the following conditions must be true]:   1. *HTTPS-enabled endpoint (ideally with stream ciphers like RC4, although the attack can be made to work with adaptive padding for block ciphers).* 2. *The attacker must be able to measure the size of HTTPS responses.* 3. *Use of HTTP-level compression (e.g. gzip).* 4. *A request parameter that is reflected in the response body.* 5. *A static secret in the body (e.g. CSRF token, sessionId, VIEWSTATE, PII, etc.) that can be bootstrapped (either first/last two characters are predictable and/or the secret is padded with something like KnownSecretVariableName=.* 6. *An otherwise static or relatively static response. Dynamic pages do not defeat the attack, but make it much more expensive.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| A sophisticated attacker may be able to derive plaintext secrets from the ciphertext in an HTTPS stream. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| Some of these mitigations may protect entire applications, while others may only protect individual web pages.     + Disable HTTP compression. + Separate the secrets from the user input. + Randomize the secrets in each client request. + Mask secrets (effectively randomizing by XORing with a random secret per request). + Protect web pages from CSRF attacks. + Obfuscate the length of web responses by adding random amounts of arbitrary bytes. |

## Security advisory: BREACH and Django

Posted by **Jacob Kaplan-Moss** on Aug. 6, 2013

At last week's Black Hat conference, researchers announced the [BREACH attack](http://breachattack.com/), a new attack on web apps that can recover data even when secured with SSL connections. The [BREACH paper](http://breachattack.com/resources/BREACH%20-%20SSL%2C%20gone%20in%2030%20seconds.pdf) (PDF) contains full details (and is a good and fairly easy read).

Given what we know so far, we believe that **BREACH may be used to compromise Django's CSRF protection**. Thus, we're issuing this advisory so that our users can defend themselves.

BREACH takes advantage of vulnerabilities when serving compressed data over SSL/TLS. Thus, to protect yourself from BREACH, you should disable compression of web responses. Depending on how your application is deployed, this could take a couple forms:

1. Disabling [Django's GZip middleware](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/middleware/#module-django.middleware.gzip).
2. Disabling GZip compression in your web server's config. For example, if you're using Apache you'd want to disable [mod\_deflate](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_deflate.html); in nginx you'd disable the [gzip module](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpGzipModule).

Additionally, you should make sure you disable TLS compression by [adjusting your server's SSL ciphers](http://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/).

We plan to take steps to address BREACH in Django itself, but in the meantime we recommend that all users of Django understand this vulnerability and take action if appropriate.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=995168#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-08 17:22:35 UTC  ``` Angelo Prado, Neal Harris and Yoel Gluck reported [1],[2] that SSL/TLS attacks are still viable via a "BREACH" (Browser Reconnaissance & Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext) attack, which they describe as:  While CRIME was mitigated by disabling TLS/SPDY compression (and by modifying gzip to allow for explicit separation of compression contexts in SPDY), BREACH attacks HTTP responses. These are compressed using the common HTTP compression, which is much more common than TLS-level compression. This allows essentially the same attack demonstrated by Duong and Rizzo, but without relying on TLS-level compression (as they anticipated).  BREACH is a category of vulnerabilities and not a specific instance affecting a specific piece of software. To be vulnerable, a web application must:  * Be served from a server that uses HTTP-level compression * Reflect user-input in HTTP response bodies * Reflect a secret (such as a CSRF token) in HTTP response bodies  It is important to note that the attack is agnostic to the version of TLS/SSL, and does not require TLS-layer compression. Additionally, the attack works against any cipher suite. Against a stream cipher, the attack is simpler; the difference in sizes across response bodies is much more granular in this case. If a block cipher is used, additional work must be done to align the output to the cipher text blocks.   CERT has an entry describing the flaw as well [3].  Currently no CVE is assigned as MITRE is attempting to determine whether one CVE will suffice, or whether it will require multiple CVEs (one per affected product). [4]  Mitigations are noted by the researchers as follows  1. Disable HTTP compression. 2. Separate the secrets from the user input. 3. Randomize the secrets in each client request. 4. Mask secrets (effectively randomizing by XORing with a random secret per request). 5. Protect web pages from CSRF attacks. 6. Obfuscate the length of web responses by adding random amounts of arbitrary bytes.

As noted in Novell's bug report [1] we need to look at mod_deflate, probably mod_gzip, and Accept-* headers in case PHP is doing output compression (the same would likely go for other languages).

Sidhpurwala    2014-01-08 04:08:53 UTC  ``` While there has been some discussion about addressing this flaw in upstream Apache project, no decision was reached. It is currently unlikely that this issue will be fixed at server level. Discussion here:  [http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@httpd.apache.org/msg57592.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40httpd.apache.org/msg57592.html)  The version of httpd package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 is not vulnerable by default, because 'DEFLATE' is not enabled in its default configuration.  The simplest mitigation is to disable DEFLATE for responses which are vulnerable to this attack. Other mitigation options are listed in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=995168#c0)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=995168#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-01-08 04:16:01 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue is not planned to be addressed in the version of httpd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6. More details and possible mitigations are mentioned in [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=995168#c5](show_bug.cgi?id=995168#c5 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-3587 BREACH attack against HTTP compression")   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=995168#c7)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-01-08 06:14:35 UTC  ``` This issue affects the version of httpd package as shipped with Fedora 19 and Fedora 20.

msm1267 writes *"A serious attack against ciphertext secrets buried inside HTTPS responses has prompted an advisory from Homeland Security. The BREACH attack is an offshoot of CRIME, which was thought dead and buried after it was disclosed in September. Released at last week's Black Hat USA 2013, BREACH enables an attacker to [read encrypted messages over the Web by injecting plaintext into an HTTPS request](http://threatpost.com/breach-compression-attack-steals-https-secrets-in-under-30-seconds/101579) and measuring compression changes. Researchers Angelo Prado, Neal Harris and Yoel Gluck demonstrated the attack against Outlook Web Access (OWA) at Black Hat. Once the Web application was opened and the Breach attack was launched, within 30 seconds the attackers had extracted the secret. 'We are currently [unaware of a practical solution to this problem](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/987798),' said the CERT advisory, released one day after the Black Hat presentation."*

    Here's the list of requirements from CERT. All of these must be true for the attack to work. From this list, a creative person could think of many ways a website could avoid this exploit, but it's harder for the client.

    1. HTTPS-enabled endpoint (ideally with stream ciphers like RC4, although the attack can be made to work with adaptive padding for block ciphers).

    2. The attacker must be able to measure the size of HTTPS responses.

    3. Use of HTTP-level compression (e.g. gzip).

    4. A request parameter that is reflected in the response body.

    5. A static secret in the body (e.g. CSRF token, sessionId, VIEWSTATE, PII, etc.) that can be bootstrapped (either first/last two characters are predictable and/or the secret is padded with something like KnownSecretVariableName="".

    6. An otherwise static or relatively static response. Dynamic pages do not defeat the attack, but make it much more expensive.

      Client protection is simple. Disable HTTP content compression using the Accept-Encoding HTTP request header.

  This is quite an ingenious attack, but I am very surprised it has taken people so long to find it, as it is very straightforward and easy to understand conceptually. Makes you wonder "how did I not think of that".

  Although it may seem like the requirements of a successful attack are difficult to achieve, this may not be the case.
  It is usually very easy to inject some plain-text in the source code of webpages.

  On facebook:
  [https://www.facebook.com/photo.php/INJECT\_WHATEVER\_YOU\_WANT\_HERE/](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php/INJECT_WHATEVER_YOU_WANT_HERE/ "facebook.com") [facebook.com]
  If you view the source of that URL you can see the text "INJECT\_WHATEVER\_YOU\_WANT\_HERE" appears 3 times in the source code.
  By appending the query string, on youtube:
  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLkugwOYbFw&INJECT\_WHATEVER\_YOU\_WANT\_HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLkugwOYbFw&INJECT_WHATEVER_YOU_WANT_HERE "youtube.com") [youtube.com]
  And on google:
  [https://www.google.com/?INJECT\_WHATEVER\_YOU\_WANT\_HERE](https://www.google.com/?INJECT_WHATEVER_YOU_WANT_HERE "google.com") [google.com]

  That means that an attacker can extract secret information from a lot of the HTTPS pages that you're visiting.

  When I first read about this attack, the first fix that came into my mind was to just append /\* [random text of random size] \*/ to all text/html responses.

    But this may cause troubles: if the random padding is too large, the purpose of compression
  is defeated. If it is too small, workarounds may be found.

  Maybe it is time to start thinking of algorithms that perform compression and encryption together, not separately?

      This attack has little to do with SSL itself or the cryptosystems used. It's more about the preservation of size when encrypting. Combined with compression, information about the amount of entropy in the plaintext is leaked. If you are allowed to manipulate parts of the plaintext a lot of times, then amount of entropy leakage provides with an answer to the question "does the injected substring appear anywhere else in the plaintext?".

    Open the Net panel of Firebug on this page and then refresh it a couple of times. Order the HTTP requests by Size. You will see that the HTML of this page is takes the vast majority of bandwidth. Images are simply a "304 Not modified", whereas the HTML is a "200 OK" of ~41KB at this time.

  The DEFLATE and gzip formats allows multiple blocks of compressed data as well as blocks containing literals with no compression. Plus, just because the default implementation always looks for duplicate strings, doesn't mean you always have to do so. While it would add a heck of a lot of complexity, it should be possible for a web server to ignore duplicates that occur in sensitive strings, and output them in literal blocks so that they don't effect the frequency data of the rest of the stream. All without requiring any changes to browser implementations. This is far from simple, but could probably be done in a generic way for well known http headers.

# SSL, GONE IN 30 SECONDS

## A BREACH beyond CRIME - Introducing our newest toy from Black Hat USA 2013:

### Browser Reconnaissance & Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext

![](images/img_point.png)

## History

SEP

2012

![](images/img_point.png)

At ekoparty 2012, Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo announced CRIME, a compression side-channel attack against HTTPS. An attacker with the ability to:

* Inject partial chosen plaintext into a victim's requests
* Measure the size of encrypted traffic

can leverage information leaked by compression to recover targeted parts of the plaintext.

Compression side-channel attacks are not new. Indeed, ten years before Duong and Rizzo's presentation, a [paper](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iacr.org%2Fcryptodb%2Fdata%2Fpaper.php%3Fpubkey%3D3091&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE3bLw6qw3leHgt5FquRGbloOecEA) appeared describing such attacks in general. However, CRIME gave a concrete, real-world example.

The particular demonstration given at ekoparty showed how an attacker might execute this attack to recover the headers of an HTTP request. Since HTTP headers contain cookies, and cookies are the primary vehicle for web application authentication (after login), this presents a significant attack.

By disabling TLS/SSL-level compression â which was already little-used, and in fact disabled in most browsers â the attack as demonstrated at ekoparty is completely [mitigated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_%28security_exploit%29).

## Breach

While CRIME was mitigated by disabling TLS/SPDY compression (and by modifying gzip to allow for explicit separation of compression contexts in SPDY), BREACH attacks HTTP responses. These are compressed using the common HTTP compression, which is much more common than TLS-level compression. This allows essentially the same attack demonstrated by Duong and Rizzo, but without relying on TLS-level compression (as they anticipated).

BREACH is a category of vulnerabilities and not a specific instance affecting a specific piece of software. To be vulnerable, a web application must:

* Be served from a server that uses HTTP-level compression
* Reflect user-input in HTTP response bodies
* Reflect a secret (such as a CSRF token) in HTTP response bodies

Additionally, while not strictly a requirement, the attack is helped greatly by responses that remain mostly the same (modulo the attacker's guess). This is because the difference in size of the responses measured by the attacker can be quite small. Any noise in the side-channel makes the attack more difficult (though not impossible).

It is important to note that the attack is agnostic to the version of TLS/SSL, and does not require TLS-layer compression. Additionally, the attack works against any cipher suite. Against a stream cipher, the attack is simpler; the difference in sizes across response bodies is much more granular in this case. If a block cipher is used, additional work must be done to align the output to the cipher text blocks.

### How practical is it?

The BREACH attack can be exploited with just a few thousand requests, and can be executed in under a minute. The number of requests required will depend on the secret size. The power of the attack comes from the fact that it allows guessing a secret one character at a time.

### Am I affected?

If you have an  HTTP response body that meets all the following conditions, you might be vulnerable:

* ![](images/compression.png)

  Compression

  Your page is served with HTTP compression enabled (GZIP / DEFLATE)
* ![](images/userdata.png)

  User Data

  Your page reflects user data via query string parameters, POST...
* ![](images/secret.png)

  A Secret

  Your application page serves PII, a CSRF token, sensitive data...

## Mitigations
![](images/lamp.png)

We offer several tactics for mitigating the attack. Unfortunately, we are unaware of a clean, effective, practical solution to the problem. Some of these mitigations are more practical and a single change can cover entire apps, while others are page specific.

A very effective mitigation is **[HTB (Heal-the-BREACH)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9754554/)** that modifies the server-side gzip compression library to add randomness to the size of the response content. This randomness precludes BREACH from guessing the correct characters in the secret token. HTB protects all websites and pages in the server with minimal CPU usage and minimal bandwidth increase.

Other mitigations are ordered by effectiveness (not by their practicality - as this may differ from one application to another).

1. Disabling HTTP compression
2. Separating secrets from user input
3. Randomizing secrets per request
4. Masking secrets (effectively randomizing by XORing with a random secret per request)
5. Protecting vulnerable pages with CSRF
6. Length hiding (by adding random number of bytes to the responses)
7. Rate-limiting the requests

Whichever mitigation you choose, it is strongly recommended you also monitor your traffic to detect attempted attacks.
