### [Just bad](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/just-bad/)

Test on dev site before thinking to use.
It simply does not work with on HSTS websites. It adds an old style icon beside all posts on backend, clicking which starts a wizard to submit on their Pinterest like site. If they wanted to create Pinterest like site, they could extract the metadata or extract data feed.

This plugin looks like 1997. Thats not that much of a problem. Its free, I just wanted to take a look. What really has upset me was, that they sent me an email on my admin e-mail-adress. There is no unsubscribe or whatsoever inside of the mail, so I am guessing they have my adress now, even after I deinstalled the plugin. I have not opted into anything, I can not unsubscribe. I think this is very bad taste and against numerous laws, to immediately grab my adress and send me something. Skip that one is my advice…! If I am receiving spam on my adress from this date on, I will be very pissed…

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
