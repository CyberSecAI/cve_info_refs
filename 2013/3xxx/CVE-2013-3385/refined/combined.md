| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 0.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 0.0 |

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.   This advisory is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130626-wsa>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsAll models of   Cisco Web Security Appliance running a vulnerable version of Cisco IronPort   AsyncOS Software are affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities   described in this advisory.      Some of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory affect   Cisco IronPort Async OS for Cisco Content Security Management and Cisco Email Security   Appliance.   Consult the Cisco security advisory *Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Content Security Management Appliance* at <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130626-sma> for additional information about the   vulnerabilities affecting Cisco Content Security Management Appliance  and Cisco   security advisory *Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Email Security   Appliance* at <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130626-esa> for   additional information about the vulnerabilities affecting Cisco Email   Security Appliance.         Determining the Running Software Version To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IronPort AsyncOS   Software for Cisco Web Security is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software version 7.5.1-079:  ```   ciscowsa> versionCurrent Version===============Product: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security ApplianceModel: S670Version: 7.5.1-079   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableWith the exception of Cisco Content Security Management and Cisco Email Security   Appliance, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected   by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco Web Security Appliance is a secure web gateway that combines advanced malware protection, application visibility and control (AVC), acceptable use policy controls, reporting, and secure mobility on a single platform.      **Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerabilities**      Two vulnerabilities in the web framework code could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to to execute arbitrary   commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.       The vulnerabilities are due to the failure to properly sanitize user   supplied input that is utilized to perform actions that   leverage the underlying command-line interface of the device. An   authenticated, unprivileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability   by sending a crafted URL to the affected system or convince a   valid user to click on a malicious URL. An successful exploit could allow the   attacker to take complete   control of the affected device. These vulnerabilities can only be triggered by IPv4 traffic directed to the management IP addresses of the affected system.   These vulnerabilities can be exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 8080 or TCP port 8443.  **Note:** The default management ports can be reconfigured on the system. These vulnerabilities are documented by Cisco bug IDs [CSCzv69294](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv69294) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCzv85726](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv85726) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2013-3383 and CVE-2013-3384.      **Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) function in the web framework code could allow an unauthenticated,   remote attacker to cause multiple processes to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition.      The vulnerability is due to   improper handling, processing and termination of HTTP and HTTPS connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending multiple HTTP or HTTPS requests to any management enabled interfaces of   the affected system. A full TCP three-way handshake is required to   exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker prevent management access via the GUI and cause other critical process to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition. A hard reboot of the affected system is needed to restore full functionality.      This vulnerability can only be triggered by IPv4 traffic directed to the   management IP addresses of the affected system. This vulnerability can   be exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 8080 or TCP port 8443.  **Note:** The default management ports can be reconfigured on the system. This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCzv58669](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv58669) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3385.  Workarounds  * All the vulnerabilities described in this security advisory can be mitigated by   disabling management access to the affected system GUI.    Administrators can use the **interfaceconifg** command to disable appliance management via the GUI. Alternatively, this can be done via the   GUI by editing the management interface properties under Network->IP   interfaces-> Edit and then selecting Disable Appliance Management.   **Note:** Administrators can manage the affected system via SSH and command-line interface while GUI access is   disabled. However, not all commands and features may be available via command-line interface.      Administrators can also limit the attack surface by restricting IP   addresses that can access the management interface. This can be   done using the **adminaccessconfig** command and selecting *IPACCESS* from the menu.      Administrator should also implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection if available on their platform and software release. This will help limit the attack surface of the command injection vulnerabilities, although will not completely eliminate them.      Additional workaround details are available in the companion Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) at the following location:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=29452>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. The following table lists the first fixed releases that contain fixes for the two authenticated command injection vulnerabilities:      | **Major Release** | **First Fixed In** |   | --- | --- |   | 7.1 and prior | 7.1.3-033 and 7.1.4-101 |   | 7.5 | 7.5.0-838 |   | 7.7 | 7.7.0-550 |         The following table list the first fixed releases that contain fixes   for the Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability:      | **Major Release** | **First Fixed In** |   | --- | --- |   | 7.1 and prior | 7.1.3-033 and 7.1.4-101 |   | 7.5 | 7.5.0-838 and 7.5.1-201 |   | 7.7 | 7.7.0-602 |         The following table lists the recommended releases that include fixes for all the vulnerabilities in described in this security advisory:      | **Major Release** | **Recommended** |   | --- | --- |   | 7.1 and prior | 7.5.1-201 or later |   | 7.5 | 7.5.1-201 or later |   | 7.7 | 7.7.0-602 or later |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.4 |

Some of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory affect   Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security and Cisco Content Management Security Appliance.   Consult the Cisco security advisory *Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Web Security Appliance* at <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130626-wsa>   for additional information about the vulnerabilities affecting Cisco   Web Security Appliance and Cisco security advisory *Multiple   Vulnerabilities in Cisco Content Management Security Appliance* at <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130626-sma>  for   additional information about the vulnerabilities affecting Cisco Content Management Security Appliance.   Determining the Running Software Version To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software version 7.6.2-201:  ```   ciscoesa> versionCurrent Version===============Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) ApplianceModel: X1070Version: 7.6.2-201[...]   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableWith the exception of Cisco Content Security Management and Cisco Web Security   Appliances, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected   by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco Email Security Appliance provides email management and protection combining antispam, antivirus, and encryption technologies.      **Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the web framework code could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.        The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user supplied input that is subsequently utilized to perform an action that leverages the underlying command-line interface of the device. An authenticated but unprivileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to the affected system, or by convincing a valid user to click on a malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with sufficient knowledge to take complete control of the affected device. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic directed to the management IP addresses of the affected system.   This vulnerability can be exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 80 or TCP port 443.  **Note:** The default management ports can be reconfigured on the system. This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCzv44633](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv44633) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3384.      **IronPort Spam Quarantine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the IronPort Spam Quarantine (ISQ) function in the web framework code could allow an unauthenticated,   remote attacker to cause multiple critical processes to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition.      The vulnerability is due to   improper handling and processing of TCP connection requests   sent at high rate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   a sending sequence of TCP requests to the ISQ service port that is open on the ISQ-enabled interfaces of   the affected system. A full TCP three-way handshake is required to   exploit this vulnerability. An successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash   or make unresponsive the ISQ service and cause other critical processes to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition. A hard reboot of the affected system is needed to restore full functionality. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic directed to ISQ enabled interfaces of the affected system.   This vulnerability can be exploited over the default ISQ ports, TCP port 82 or TCP port 83.  **Note:** The default ISQ ports can be reconfigured on the system. This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCzv25573](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv25573) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3386.      **Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) function in the web framework code could allow an unauthenticated,   remote attacker to cause multiple processes to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition.      The vulnerability is due to   improper handling, processing and termination of HTTP and HTTPS connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending multiple HTTP or HTTPS requests to any management enabled interfaces of   the affected system. A full TCP three-way handshake is required to   exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker prevent management access via the GUI and cause other critical process to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition. A hard reboot of the affected system is needed to restore full functionality.      This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic directed to the management IP addresses of the affected system. This vulnerability can be exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 80 or TCP port 443.  **Note:** The default management ports can be reconfigured on the system. This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCzv63329](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv63329) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been   assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3385.  Workarounds  * The Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability and Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability could be mitigated by disabling management access to the affected system GUI.    Administrators can use the **interfaceconifg** command to disable appliance management via the GUI. Alternatively, this can be done via the   GUI by editing the management interface properties under Network->IP   interfaces-> Edit and then selecting Disable Appliance Management.   **Note:** Administrators can manage the affected system via SSH and command-line interface while GUI access is   disabled. However, not all commands and features may be available via command-line interface.      Administrators can also limit the attack surface by restricting IP addresses that can access the management interface. This can be   done using the **adminaccessconfig** command and selecting *IPACCESS* from the menu.      Administrator should also implement Cross-Site Request Forgery   protection if available on their platform and software release. This   will help limit the attack surface of the Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability, although it will not completely eliminate it.      The IronPort Spam Quarantine Denial of Service Vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the end-user access to the ISQ service. Administrators can disable this access using the **interfaceconfig** command. Alternatively, this can be done via the   GUI by editing the settings for Spam Quarantine under Monitor->Quarantines-> Edit and then unchecking the option "Enable End-User Quarantine Access".   **Note:** Users will be unable to manage their safe list and block list while end-user access is disabled.      Additional workaround details are available in the companion Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) at the following location:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=29452>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

CVE-2013-3383,CVE-2013-3384,CVE-2013-3385,CVE-2013-3386  CWE-399 CWE-78       Email      Summary  * Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software for Cisco Content Security Management Appliance is affected by the following vulnerabilities:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsAll models of Cisco Content Security Management Appliance running a vulnerable version of Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software are affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory.      Some of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory affect Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security and Cisco Email Security Appliance.   Consult the Cisco security advisory *Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Web Security Appliance* at <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130626-wsa> for additional information about the vulnerabilities affecting Cisco Web Security Appliances and Cisco security advisory *Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Email Security Appliance* at <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130626-esa> for   additional information about the vulnerabilities affecting Cisco Email Security Appliance.   Determining the Running Software Version To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IronPort AsyncOS   Software for Cisco Content Security Management is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software version 7.9.1-039:  ```   ciscosma> versionCurrent Version===============Product: Cisco IronPort M670 Security Management(tm) ApplianceModel: M670Version: 7.9.1-039   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableWith the exception of Cisco Web Security and Cisco Email Security Appliance, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco Content Security Management Appliance consolidates policy and run-time data in a single management interface, providing a centralized platform for all reporting and auditing for Cisco Email and Web Security Appliances.   **Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the web framework code could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.        The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user supplied input that is subsequently utilized to perform an action that leverages the underlying command-line interface of the device. An authenticated but unprivileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to the affected system, or by convincing a valid user to click on a malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with sufficient knowledge to take complete control of the affected device.      This vulnerability can only be triggered by IPv4 traffic directed to the management IP addresses of the affected system.   This vulnerability can be exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 80 or TCP port 443.       **Note:** The default management ports can be reconfigured on the system.       This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCzv24579](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv24579) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3384.      **IronPort Spam Quarantine Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the IronPort Spam Quarantine (ISQ) function in the web framework code could allow an unauthenticated,   remote attacker to cause multiple critical processes to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition.      The vulnerability is due to   improper handling and processing of TCP connection requests   sent at high rate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   a sending sequence of TCP requests to the ISQ service port that is open on the ISQ-enabled interfaces of   the affected system. A full TCP three-way handshake is required to   exploit this vulnerability. An successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash   or make unresponsive the ISQ service and cause other critical processes to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition. A hard reboot of the affected system is needed to restore full functionality.      This vulnerability can only be triggered by IPv4 traffic directed to ISQ-enabled interfaces of the affected system.   This vulnerability can be exploited over the default ISQ ports, TCP port 82 or TCP port 83.      **Note:** The default ISQ ports can be reconfigured on the system.       This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCzv81712](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv81712) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3386      **Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) function in the web framework code could allow an unauthenticated,   remote attacker to cause multiple processes to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition.      The vulnerability is due to   improper handling, processing and termination of HTTP and HTTPS connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   sending multiple HTTP or HTTPS requests to any management enabled interfaces of   the affected system. A full TCP three-way handshake is required to   exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker prevent management access via the GUI and cause other critical process to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition. A hard reboot of the affected system is needed to restore full functionality.      This vulnerability can only be triggered by IPv4 traffic directed to   the management IP addresses of the affected system. This vulnerability   can be exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 80 or TCP port 443.       **Note:** The default management ports can be reconfigured on the system.       This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCzv78669](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv78669) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3385  Workarounds  * The   Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability and Management GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability could be mitigated by disabling   management access to the affected system GUI.    Administrators can use the **interfaceconifg** command to disable appliance management via the GUI. Alternatively, this can be done via the   GUI by editing the management interface properties under Network->IP   interfaces-> Edit and then selecting Disable Appliance Management.   **Note:** Administrators can manage the affected system via SSH and command-line interface while GUI access is   disabled. However, not all commands and features may be available via command-line interface.      Administrators can also limit the attack surface by restricting IP   addresses that can access the management interface. This can be   done using the **adminaccessconfig** command and selecting *IPACCESS* from the menu.      Administrator should also implement Cross-Site Request Forgery   protection if available on their platform and software release. This   will help limit the attack surface of the Web Framework Authenticated Command Injection Vulnerability, although it will not completely   eliminate it.      The IronPort Spam Quarantine Denial of Service Vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the end-user access to the ISQ service. Administrators can disable this access using the **interfaceconfig** command. Alternatively, this can be done via the   GUI by editing the settings for Spam Quarantine under   Management Appliance->Centralized Services and then unchecking the option "Enable   End-User Quarantine Access".   **Note:** Users will be unable to manage their safe list and block list while End User Access is disabled.      Additional workaround details are available in the companion Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) at the following location:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=29452>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release.
