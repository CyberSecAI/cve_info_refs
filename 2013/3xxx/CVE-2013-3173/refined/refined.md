Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3173:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel-mode driver (`win32k.sys`) improperly handling objects in memory. Specifically, it's a buffer overwrite issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overwrite:** The `win32k.sys` driver has a flaw that allows a buffer overwrite. This occurs when the driver processes certain memory objects incorrectly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This means they can gain administrative control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and the ability to log on to the system locally. Then, they can run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** Attackers must have a valid user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** Attackers must be able to execute a specially crafted program on the target system.
