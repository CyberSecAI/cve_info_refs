Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3619:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of static encryption keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of static encryption keys. This implies that the same encryption key is used across multiple devices or instances of the firmware.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who obtains the static encryption key could potentially decrypt sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions that rely on encryption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Obtaining the static encryption key through reverse engineering, firmware extraction, or other means.
- If the encrypted data is transmitted or stored, having the static key could lead to the decryption of the data

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to gain access to the static encryption key to exploit this vulnerability. This could require physical access to the device, the ability to extract firmware, or access to a location where keys are stored.

**Affected Firmware:**
- SMT X9 317, SMT X8 312
