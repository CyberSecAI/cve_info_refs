  "vulnerability": "CVE-2013-3131",
  "affected_components": [
    ".NET Framework"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework improperly handles multidimensional arrays of small structures.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper handling of multidimensional arrays",
     "Array Access Violation"
  ],
  "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users with administrative rights could have their system completely taken over.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "A .NET application could be modified to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "A website could host a specially crafted Silverlight application to exploit the vulnerability, which could be viewed by a user."
   ],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "For .NET application attack, ability to modify array data.",
      "For web-based attack, ability to host a malicious website or compromise existing websites.",
    "For web-based attacks, ability to convince a user to visit the website."
  ],
   "additional_information": [
    "The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker who can get a user to visit a malicious website or by modifying .NET application data. The vulnerability is present in how .NET handles arrays of small structures.",
    "The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted TrueType font file or if an application uses a particular pattern of code.",
      "The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Framework handles multidimensional arrays of small structures."
