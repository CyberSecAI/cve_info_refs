Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2013-3384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the web framework code of Cisco IronPort AsyncOS. This unsanitized input is then used to perform actions that leverage the underlying command-line interface of the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:**  The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system's command-line interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Control:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker with sufficient knowledge to gain complete control of the affected device.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL:** An authenticated, unprivileged attacker can send a specially crafted URL to the affected system.
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker could convince a valid user to click on a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the management interface of the affected system.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system, even with unprivileged access.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 traffic.
- It is exploited over the default management ports (TCP 80, 443 for Email and Content Security Management Appliances, TCP 8080, 8443 for Web Security Appliance)
- The vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCzv44633.
- The issue affects Cisco Email Security Appliance, Cisco Content Security Management Appliance and Cisco Web Security Appliance.

**CVSS Score:**
- Base Score: 9.0
- Temporal Score: 7.4
- Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C
