Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing an object in memory. This memory corruption can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer. This occurs because of improper handling of objects in memory, leading to a state where the attacker can manipulate the memory.
- **Remote Code Execution:** If exploited, the memory corruption leads to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run malicious code within the context of the user using the web browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system. This means the attacker can potentially gain control over the system with the same privileges as the current user.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can potentially take complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** The vulnerability is typically exploited through a specially crafted webpage.
  - Attackers could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer.
  - Compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content can also be used to deliver the exploit.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious webpage.
  - This can be done by tricking a user into clicking a link in an email or instant message.
  - Or by convincing a user to open a malicious attachment in an email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need local access to the target system.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** Attackers need to persuade the victim to visit a malicious website or open a malicious file.
- **Technical Knowledge:** Requires expertise in crafting malicious webpages that exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is present across various versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) on multiple Windows operating systems, including client and server versions.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as 'Critical' for client systems and 'Moderate' for server systems. This is due to the difference in typical user privileges on each.
- Microsoft provides details on how to mitigate the vulnerability (e.g., through setting security zones in Internet Explorer to "High" to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting or prompting before execution of Active Scripting)
- The update (KB2862772) addresses this vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- Microsoft states that the vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or being exploited at the time this advisory was issued.
-  The Microsoft Exploitability Index rating at the time was not "0 - Exploitation Detected".

In summary, CVE-2013-3184 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability caused by memory corruption in Internet Explorer. Attackers can exploit it remotely by convincing users to browse malicious websites, which could lead to complete system control.
