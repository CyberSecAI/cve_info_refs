CWE-20,CWE-264,CWE-310,CWE-89    Email      Summary  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) contains multiple vulnerabilities that could be used together to allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gather user credentials, escalate privileges, and execute commands to gain full control of the vulnerable system. A successful attack could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access, create or modify information in Cisco Unified CM.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following products are affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory:   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1(x)   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.5(x)   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 8.6(x)   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0(x)   + Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.1(x)**Note:** Cisco Unified CM version 8.0 reached the End of Software Maintenance on October 23, 2012. Customers using Cisco Unified CM 8.0(x) versions should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco Unified CM.      Cisco Unified CM is the only product confirmed to be vulnerable to the documented attack. Additional voice products may be affected by one or more of the individual vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. The following products are being investigated but have not yet been confirmed as vulnerable:   + Cisco Emergency Responder   + Cisco Unified Contact Center Express   + Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal   + Cisco Unified Presence Server/Cisco IM and Presence Service   + Cisco Unity ConnectionProducts Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Unified CM is the call processing component of the Cisco IP Telephony solution that extends enterprise telephony features and functions to packet telephony network devices, such as IP phones, media processing devices, VoIP gateways, and multimedia applications.       **Blind Structured Query Language Injection Vulnerabilities**      Cisco Unified CM and associated products may contain one or more of the following blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities may be exploited from an authenticated or unauthenticated context depending on the particular vulnerability.      SQL injection vulnerabilities are due to a failure to perform proper validation of user-supplied requests prior to being used to form an SQL query. An attacker could exploit this behavior by injecting SQL commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to disclose or modify arbitrary information in the database.      The first of the identified vulnerabilities could be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker. An exploit could allow the attacker to use metadata to recreate encrypted information in the database. This metadata could be used to reconstruct encrypted credentials.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh01051](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh01051) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3404. This vulnerability applies to Cisco Unified CM versions 9.1(1a) and prior.      The second vulnerability could be exploited by an authenticated, remote attacker. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify or insert additional data into certain tables in the database.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh81766](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh81766) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3412. This vulnerability applies to Cisco Unified CM versions 9.1(2) and prior.      These vulnerabilities can be exploited over the default management ports, TCP ports 8080 or 8443.       **Hard-Coded Encryption Key**      Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) contains a hard-coded encryption key used for the encryption of sensitive data stored within the database, and securing computer telephony integration (CTI) communications.      The issue is due to the use of a static symmetric encryption key in all Cisco Unified CM versions. An attacker could exploit this issue by using the secret key to decrypt sensitive data including user credentials. An exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt sensitive system information such as user credentials gained when using other attacks. This issue is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCsc69187](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsc69187) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only). This issue applies to Cisco Unified CM versions 9.1(2) and prior.      Cisco Unified Presence Server/IM & Presence Service versions 9.1(2) and prior are also affected by this issue. This issue is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCui01756](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui01756) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).      **Command Injection Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the database user.      The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious input to the affected function.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh73440](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh73440) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3402. This vulnerability applies to Cisco Unified CM versions 9.1(2) and prior.      **Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**      Vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges on the system.      The vulnerabilities are due to improper file permissions, environment variables and relative paths in a privileged system script or binary. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by modifying certain system scripts. This could allow the attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.      This first two privilege escalation vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh73454](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh73454) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and [CSCuh87042](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh87042) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and have been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3403.       A third privilege escalation vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCui02242](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui02242) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3434.      A fourth privilege escalation vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCui02276](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui02276) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3433.      These vulnerabilities apply to Cisco Unified CM versions 9.1(1a) and prior.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities described in this document.      Additional workaround details are available in the companion Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) at the following location: <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=29846>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.       In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       There are no Cisco Unified CM versions currently available that contain software fixes for the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. This advisory will be updated as fixed software is made available. In the interim, Cisco has released a Cisco Options Package (COP) file that addresses the following vulnerabilities: **CSCuh01051**, **CSCuh87042** and **CSCuh73454**.      Customers can download and install the COP file as a solution for the previous vulnerabilities while awaiting fixed software versions.       This package will install on the following system versions:   + 7.1.3   + 7.1.5   + 8.5.1   + 8.6.2   + 9.1.1The COP file, *cmterm-CSCuh01051-2.cop.sgn,* is located in the Utilities section of the [software downloads page](http://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html?a=a&i=rpm) for each of the versions in the preceding list. For instance, the file for 9.1(x) versions would be located by navigating the following path on the software downloads page:      **Products -> Voice and Unified Communications -> IP Telephony -> Unified Communications Platform -> Cisco Unified Communications Manager -> Cisco Unified Communications Manager Version 9.1 -> Unified Communications Manager / CallManager / Cisco Unity Connection Utilities-COP-Files**      The COP file mitigates the initial attack vector (CSCuh01051) and reduces the documented attack surface. Application of the COP file is highly recommended for all affected Cisco Unified CM product versions.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The blind SQL injection vulnerability (CSCuh01051) was initially reported to Cisco by Emerging Defense, LLC.      These vulnerabilities were demonstrated during the SSTIC 2013 IT security conference in Rennes, France on June 6, 2013, by a French security firm, Lexfo. The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
