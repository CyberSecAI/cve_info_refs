It explicitly mentions CVE-2013-3115 as an Internet Explorer memory corruption vulnerability, and states it could lead to remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage. \n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper memory access within Internet Explorer.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability leading to remote code execution.\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control of the system.\n- **Attack vectors**: Specially crafted webpage viewed by a user through Internet Explorer. This could be via a direct link, compromised websites, user-provided content, or advertisements.\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to host or inject a malicious webpage and convince a user to view the webpage via Internet Explorer. They do not need prior access to the user's system. The document notes that the vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the bulletin's release."
