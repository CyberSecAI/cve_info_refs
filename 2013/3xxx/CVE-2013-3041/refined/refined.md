Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3041:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a JSON Hijacking Attack vulnerability present in the IBM Rational ClearQuest Web Client. The document doesn't go into the specifics of the vulnerability, but the name implies that it's likely due to how the web client handles JSON data, potentially leading to unintended access or manipulation by a malicious attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- JSON Hijacking vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The specific impact is not detailed, but the nature of a JSON Hijacking Attack suggests it could allow an attacker to:
- Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data that the web client interacts with.
- Potentially manipulate data within the web client.
- Possibly execute unwanted actions within the context of an authorized user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector would be through the web client, likely by exploiting how it processes and interacts with JSON data. The attacker would need to craft malicious JSON requests or responses to exploit the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send or intercept JSON data being transmitted to the vulnerable web client. This may require them to be:
  - On the same network as the client, or
  - In a position to intercept and modify the client's network traffic.
  - Able to induce a user to make a malicious request via social engineering.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- Rational ClearQuest Web 7.1 through 7.1.2.10
- Rational ClearQuest Web 8.0 through 8.0.0.7
- Rational ClearQuest Web 8.0.1

**Remediation/Fixes:**
Upgrade to the following versions of IBM Rational ClearQuest:
* Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 1 (8.0.1.1) for 8.0.1
* Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 8 (8.0.0.8) for 8.0
