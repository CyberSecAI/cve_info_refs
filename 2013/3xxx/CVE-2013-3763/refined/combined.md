| CVSS SCORE | 6.4, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Endeca Server](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/endecaserver/documentation/endeca-documentation-1721979.html) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['13128']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Endeca Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists in the handling of requests to the controlSoapBinding web service. This service exposes the createDataStore method which contains a flaw that allows attackers to inject arbitrary operating system commands. This can be leveraged by an attacker gain to remote code execution under the context of the current process. |

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 89 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapril2013verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2013 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1548709.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1548709.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Notes:

1. Oracle released a [Java SE Critical Patch Update on June 18, 2013](/security-alerts/javacpujun2013.html) to address multiple vulnerabilities affecting the Java Runtime Environment. Oracle CVE-2013-2461 refers to the advisories that are applicable to JRockit from the Java SE Critical Patch Update. The CVSS score of this vulnerability CVE# reflects the highest among those fixed in JRockit. The complete list of all vulnerabilities addressed in JRockit under CVE-2013-2461 is as follows: CVE-2013-2461, CVE-2013-2407, CVE-2013-2457, CVE-2013-1571, CVE-2013-2451.
2. Fixed in all supported releases and patchsets.
3. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). It does not have any particular associated protocol. If the hosting software passes data received over the network to Outside In Technology code, the CVSS Base Score would increase to 6.8.
