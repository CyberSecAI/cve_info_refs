Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing an object in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption caused by how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. This corruption can allow for the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means the attacker gains the same privileges as the user currently logged into the system.
- **System Control:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attack:** The primary attack vector involves the user visiting a specially crafted website through Internet Explorer. The attacker could host the malicious website or compromise legitimate websites to host the malicious content.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious website. This could be done through email or instant messenger links. Attackers could also use email attachments containing malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Hosting Malicious Content:** The attacker needs the ability to host or inject malicious content into a website.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., by clicking on a link or opening an attachment).
- **No Direct System Access:** The attacker does not require direct access to the victim's system; the vulnerability is triggered via a web browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is part of a set of multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-080.
- This specific CVE was not publicly disclosed at the time of the bulletin's release, and there were no known reports of it being actively exploited.
