- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Buffer overflows in the internal filters of MPC-HC versions 1.6.8 and below.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the internal filters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The advisory states that the vulnerabilities are known buffer overflows and recommends updating. However, the specific impact of these overflows is not detailed in this advisory. It can be inferred that exploitation could lead to crashes, arbitrary code execution or other undefined behavior, as is typical of buffer overflows.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via media files processed by the vulnerable internal filters within MPC-HC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a crafted media file which, when processed by MPC-HC, triggers the buffer overflow. The attacker would need to be able to entice a victim to open the malicious media file.
