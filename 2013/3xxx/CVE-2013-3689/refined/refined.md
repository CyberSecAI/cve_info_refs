Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2013-3689:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the device configuration file being downloadable without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass (CWE-592):** The configuration file containing sensitive information can be accessed without any authentication, bypassing access controls.
*  **Clear Text Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312):** Sensitive information such as usernames and passwords are stored in plain text within the configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can download the configuration file, which contains sensitive information, including usernames and passwords in plain text. This allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device and potentially its network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a direct HTTP GET request to the device's web interface.
*   By sending a crafted URL to the device, an attacker can download the device's configuration file.
*  The URL is in the format: `http://xx.xx.xx.xx/configfile.dump?action=get`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the affected device on the network (it could be LAN, WLAN or exposed to the internet).
*   No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that some newer firmwares require login as administrator before downloading, but the sensitive information is still stored in plain text in the configuration file.
*   The vendor acknowledged the issue and stated that they would fix it.
*   The vulnerability affects Brickcom FB-100Ap, WCB-100Ap, MD-100Ap, WFB-100Ap, OB-100Ae, and OSD-040E devices and potentially others.
*   Affected firmwares include v3.0.6.7, v3.0.6.12, v3.0.6.16C1 (vulnerable without login), v3.1.0.8, and v3.1.0.4 (vulnerable with admin login, plain text info).
