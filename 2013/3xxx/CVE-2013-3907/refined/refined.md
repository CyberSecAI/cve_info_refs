- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused when the Windows audio port-class driver improperly handles objects in memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows audio port-class driver (portcls.sys), leading to a double fetch vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker gaining elevated privileges, reading arbitrary amounts of kernel memory, and executing arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to log on to the system locally and then run a specially crafted application designed to elevate privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the affected system.
