Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel not properly validating memory address values. This improper validation leads to a memory corruption condition within the NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability in the Windows kernel, specifically within the NTVDM. This arises from inadequate address validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- **System Control:** An attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights. This effectively grants them complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by running a specially crafted application that triggers the memory corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must have a legitimate user account on the target system.
- **Local Access:** Physical or remote access that allows local login to the target machine is required.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute their specially crafted malicious application on the target system.

**Additional Notes**
- This vulnerability is specific to 32-bit versions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 8, as well as all supported versions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
- 64-bit versions of Windows are not affected by this specific vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is located in the NTVDM, which emulates MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows environments on Windows NT-based systems.
-  The update addresses the vulnerability by changing how the Windows kernel validates memory address values, preventing the memory corruption.
- Disabling the NTVDM subsystem is mentioned as a workaround, but this will prevent users from running 16-bit applications.
