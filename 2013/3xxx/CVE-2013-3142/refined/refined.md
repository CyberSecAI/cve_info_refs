  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-3142",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory. This vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.",
      "vulnerability": "Memory corruption due to improper memory access.",
      "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to visit it. Alternatively, compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content could be used to deliver the exploit.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious website. This could be achieved through phishing emails or instant messages containing a link to the malicious site or by exploiting compromised websites."
    }
  ],
    "summary": "CVE-2013-3142 is a remote code execution vulnerability due to memory corruption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by hosting a malicious website or compromising a legitimate site, tricking users into visiting the site, and then executing code with the same privileges as the user. The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of objects in memory, leading to memory corruption. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to take full control of an affected system if the user has admin rights.",
  "mitigations": [
    "Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration (on Windows Servers) mitigates this vulnerability for sites not added to the Trusted sites zone.",
     "By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. This zone disables script and ActiveX controls, reducing the risk.",
     "Using EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) can help to mitigate this vulnerability."
  ],
  "workarounds": [
    "Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to 'High' to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting.",
     "Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.",
        "Do not debug script on untrusted webpages or webpages that you do not control."
