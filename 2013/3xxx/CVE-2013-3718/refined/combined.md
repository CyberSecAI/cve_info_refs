... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Unfortunately, that stack trace is missing some elements that will help a lot to solve the problem, so it will be hard for the developers to fix that crash. Can you get us a stack trace with debugging symbols? Please see <http://live.gnome.org/GettingTraces> for more information on how to do so and reopen this bug or report a new one. Thanks in advance! ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=701302#c2)  jutaky    2013-05-30 19:45:39 UTC  ``` I would need more details how to get a better trace with evince. Evince has been compiled with debug symbols enabled and that is the backtrace.  gdb says "Reading symbols from /home/jutaky/<removed>/evince...done." and the trace is still missing those elements.  And "objdump --syms evince" seems to verify that the symbols are there.  -- Juha KylmÃ¤nen Research Assistant, OUSPG ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=701302#c3)  GermÃ¡n Poo-CaamaÃ±o    2013-05-30 23:47:39 UTC  ``` The PDF is corrupted.

Normally, the ev_window checks whether the document has pages or not, If it has pages, then it sets the document to the view... This is not working for some reason. On the other hand, the EvView should be made more stable by checking that we have n_pages > 0 in some places (we are a library used in other apps :) ) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=701302#c6)  GermÃ¡n Poo-CaamaÃ±o    2013-05-31 01:09:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 245694](attachment.cgi?id=245694 "Check the numbers of pages when there is a new document") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=245694&action=edit "Check the numbers of pages when there is a new document") [[review]](review?bug=701302&attachment=245694) Check the numbers of pages when there is a new document ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=701302#c7)  jutaky    2013-05-31 05:11:59 UTC  ``` > The PDF is corrupted.

I am unsure about this.  This bug does not exists neither in 3.4 nor 3.6.  According to JosÃ©, it seems the order that events were triggered changed.  Is this check an expensive operation? ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=701302#c10)  GermÃ¡n Poo-CaamaÃ±o    2013-05-31 09:02:26 UTC  ``` Review of [attachment 245694](attachment.cgi?id=245694 "Check the numbers of pages when there is a new document") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=245694&action=edit "Check the numbers of pages when there is a new document") [[review]](review?bug=701302&attachment=245694):  Committed in master.

Unfortunately, that stack trace is missing some elements that will help a lot to solve the problem, so it will be hard for the developers to fix that crash. Can you get us a stack trace with debugging symbols? Please see <http://live.gnome.org/GettingTraces> for more information on how to do so and reopen this bug or report a new one. Thanks in advance! ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=701302#c2)  jutaky    2013-05-30 19:45:39 UTC  ``` I would need more details how to get a better trace with evince. Evince has been compiled with debug symbols enabled and that is the backtrace.  gdb says "Reading symbols from /home/jutaky/<removed>/evince...done." and the trace is still missing those elements.  And "objdump --syms evince" seems to verify that the symbols are there.  -- Juha KylmÃ¤nen Research Assistant, OUSPG ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=701302#c3)  GermÃ¡n Poo-CaamaÃ±o    2013-05-30 23:47:39 UTC  ``` The PDF is corrupted.

Normally, the ev_window checks whether the document has pages or not, If it has pages, then it sets the document to the view... This is not working for some reason. On the other hand, the EvView should be made more stable by checking that we have n_pages > 0 in some places (we are a library used in other apps :) ) ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=701302#c6)  GermÃ¡n Poo-CaamaÃ±o    2013-05-31 01:09:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 245694](attachment.cgi?id=245694 "Check the numbers of pages when there is a new document") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=245694&action=edit "Check the numbers of pages when there is a new document") [[review]](review?bug=701302&attachment=245694) Check the numbers of pages when there is a new document ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=701302#c7)  jutaky    2013-05-31 05:11:59 UTC  ``` > The PDF is corrupted.
