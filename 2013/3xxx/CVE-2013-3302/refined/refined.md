  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-3302",
    "description": "Linux kernel built with CIFS(CONFIG_CIFS) network file system support is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. It could occur during a re-connection attempt. An unprivileged user/program could use this flaw to crash the system, resulting in DoS.",
    "affected_components": [
      "CIFS (Common Internet File System) in Linux kernel"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing NULL socket check before passing it to kernel_setsockopt, which leads to a NULL pointer dereference during reconnection attempts.",
     "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference"
     ],
    "impact": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a system crash, resulting in a Denial-of-Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "An unprivileged user or program can trigger the vulnerability by causing a CIFS reconnection attempt while the underlying socket is NULL.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to trigger a CIFS reconnection. This can be achieved by interacting with the CIFS network file system in a way that would cause a disconnect followed by a reconnection attempt.",
    "references": [
      "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=952260",
      "https://git.kernel.org/linus/ea702b80e0bbb2448e201472127288beb82ca2fe",
        "https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-3302"
    ],
     "solution": "The fix involves moving the check for a NULL socket into the `smb_send_rqst` function to ensure that it's checked before being passed to kernel_setsockopt. This prevents the NULL pointer dereference.",
    "additional_notes": "The provided fix is considered a 'half-assed' fix due to unclear locking rules around the `ssocket` pointer. The underlying socket handling mechanism is suggested to require a fundamental re-think to improve its robustness."
