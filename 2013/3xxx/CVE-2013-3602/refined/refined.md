Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3602:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the improper neutralization of special elements used in a SQL command, also known as SQL injection. Specifically, the `docID` parameter in the `/coursemill/cm0660/admindocumentworker.jsp` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application directly passes user-supplied input from the `docID` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious SQL code, potentially gaining access to sensitive database information, modifying data, or potentially executing arbitrary code on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `docID` parameter within the `/coursemill/cm0660/admindocumentworker.jsp` request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the affected JSP page, which is part of the Coursemill application. This likely means being able to access the application over the network. The attacker does not need prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Coursemill 6.6 and was remediated in Coursemill 6.8.
