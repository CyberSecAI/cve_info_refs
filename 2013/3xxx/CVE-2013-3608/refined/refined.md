{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Supermicro IPMI web interface does not properly sanitize input, leading to shell injection vulnerabilities.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)",
       "Lack of server-side input validation",
      "Use of  insecure functions like `strcpy` and `strcat` without length validation",
      "Client-side privilege validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker may obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code as a privileged user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By sending arbitrary requests to the IPMI web interface",
      "Exploiting shell injection vulnerabilities via the web interface.",
      "Exploiting buffer overflows in the login page."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the IPMI interface, typically on port 80 or 443. For some exploits, an IPMI user account is required but default credentials may be available. For the buffer overflow on login, no authentication is necessary."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "vulnerable_components": [
      "CGI scripts `login.cgi` and `close_window.cgi`",
      "Web interface of the IPMI controller"
    ],
     "affected_products": [
        "Supermicro X9 generation motherboards with firmware revision v2.24 and older",
        "Multiple Supermicro product models using ATEN-based IPMI firmware"
    ],
      "mitigations": [
      "Update BMC Firmware to a version that addresses the vulnerability",
      "Restrict IPMI traffic to trusted internal networks.",
       "Do not expose IPMI management interfaces to public networks",
       "Disable IPMI if not required"
    ],
    "notes": "The vulnerabilities are due to the use of strcpy and strcat without proper input length validation. Client-side validation is easily bypassed. The BMC has weak ASLR implementation and lacks DEP and stack canaries."
