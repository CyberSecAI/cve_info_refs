Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2013-3155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Access handles memory when parsing specially crafted Access files. Specifically, there is a memory corruption vulnerability present when processing the file content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption due to improper parsing and validation of data within specially crafted Access files. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   The document refers to multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities, and CVE-2013-3155 is one of three such vulnerabilities being addressed. The other two are CVE-2013-3156 and CVE-2013-3157.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system.
*   **Malicious Activities:** An attacker could install programs; view, change, or delete data; and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Impact based on user rights:** Users with fewer user rights may be less affected than those with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Access File:** The primary attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted Access file.
*   **Email Attack:** An attacker could send the malicious file via email and convince the user to open it.
*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host the malicious file on a website, or compromise an existing website, and trick users into downloading and opening it. The attacker would have to convince users to visit this website, typically by getting them to click on a link.
*   **User Interaction Required:** In all scenarios, user interaction is necessary to initiate the exploitation by opening the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Access File:** The attacker needs the capability to create a specially crafted Access file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to use social engineering to convince the user to open the file, whether via email, a malicious website, or other means.

**Additional Information:**

*   The document mentions that the vulnerabilities were privately reported.
*   The updates correct the way Microsoft Access validates data when opening Access files.
*   The Exploitability Index for this vulnerability was rated as "1" (Exploitation more likely). This indicates that Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created such that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability.

This content provides more details than the standard CVE description, as it clarifies the attack vectors, the impact of successful exploitation, the technical root cause of the vulnerability (memory corruption due to improper parsing), and it links this CVE with two others, as they were fixed by the same patch.
