Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an HTTP header injection flaw specifically within the `Content-Disposition` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Header Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided data that is incorporated into the `Content-Disposition` HTTP response header. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values into this header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Although the vulnerability is limited to the `Content-Disposition` header, older browsers may allow multiple `Content-Disposition` values. An attacker could potentially inject a malicious `Content-Disposition` value that could lead to XSS.
    *   It's noted that newer browsers have security measures to prevent this, limiting the potential for XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through injecting malicious input into the data that gets used to generate the `Content-Disposition` header within the HTTP response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the data that is used to create the `Content-Disposition` header. This typically means they need to be able to provide or manipulate input that the application uses in this part of the response.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects RT (Request Tracker) versions 3.8.0 and above.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Dominic Hargreaves.
*   Patches for all releases of 3.8.x and 4.0.x of RT are available.
*   The provided content mentions that the vulnerability is limited to the Content-Disposition header and injection of arbitrary response headers is not possible.

In summary, CVE-2013-3372 describes an HTTP header injection vulnerability in the `Content-Disposition` header of the RT application. While the risk of XSS is limited to older browsers, the vulnerability still requires patching to prevent potential exploitation.
