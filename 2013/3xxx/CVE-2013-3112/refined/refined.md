Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-3112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer when it improperly accesses an object in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption that could allow arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: The core issue is that improper handling of objects in memory leads to corruption, which can be leveraged by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
    - If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker gains full control over the affected system.
- **Full System Control:** Attackers can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host specially crafted websites designed to exploit the vulnerability. They then need to convince users to visit these sites.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can also inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content (e.g., forums, ad networks).
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers rely on convincing users to click on malicious links or open malicious attachments via email or instant messages, which then directs them to the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** Attackers need a platform (website, compromised server, etc.) to host the exploit.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** Attackers need to convince users to visit their malicious websites or open malicious attachments.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers need to have the technical knowledge to craft the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects various versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) on different Windows platforms.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client versions of Windows and "Moderate" for server versions.
- Mitigation measures include using Enhanced Security Configuration (on Windows Servers), keeping security settings at "High," disabling Active Scripting, and using EMET.
- Microsoft confirmed that there were no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild at the time of the security bulletin publication.
- The vulnerability was reported through coordinated vulnerability disclosure, specifically by an anonymous researcher working with HP's Zero Day Initiative.
