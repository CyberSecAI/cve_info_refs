Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-3652

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper handling of user input within the `LC_Page_Products_List.php` file, specifically in the `lfSetSelectedData` function. The `classcategory_id2` parameter from the user supplied `arrForm` data is directly embedded into JavaScript code without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. The unsanitized input is directly placed within the JavaScript code. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed within the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL or form that includes the malicious javascript within the `classcategory_id2` parameter.
- The attack is performed remotely (over the network) and no authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to visit a crafted URL or interact with a form that contains the malicious payload. This could be done through social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing).
- No specific privileges or elevated access is needed by the attacker.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerable code snippet is in `LC_Page_Products_List.php`, originally:

```php
$arrProducts[$key]['quantity']          = $arrForm['quantity'];
$arrProducts[$key]['arrErr']            = $arrErr;
$js_fnOnLoad .= "fnSetClassCategories(document.product_form{$arrProducts[$key]['product_id']}, '{$arrForm['classcategory_id2']}');";
```

The fix is to use `SC_Utils_Ex::jsonEncode` to properly escape the `classcategory_id2` parameter before embedding it into the JavaScript:

```php
$arrProducts[$key]['quantity']          = $arrForm['quantity'];
$arrProducts[$key]['arrErr']            = $arrErr;
$classcategory_id2 = SC_Utils_Ex::jsonEncode($arrForm['classcategory_id2']);
$js_fnOnLoad .= "fnSetClassCategories(document.product_form{$arrProducts[$key]['product_id']}, {$classcategory_id2});";
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in EC-CUBE versions 2.11.0 through 2.12.4 and their respective english versions.
- The vulnerability was fixed in changeset 22862.
- The vendor has provided patches for different affected versions of EC-CUBE.
