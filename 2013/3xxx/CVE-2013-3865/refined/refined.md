  "CVE-2013-3865": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory, potentially leading to an elevation of privilege. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit these vulnerabilities.",
    "details": [
      "**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys).",
      "**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple fetch vulnerabilities in win32k.sys.",
       "**Impact of exploitation:** Elevation of privilege, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, potentially leading to full system compromise, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full administrative rights. Also the ability to read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.",
      "**Attack vectors:** Local attack, requiring the attacker to log on to the system and execute a specially crafted application.",
      "**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally."
