Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a privilege bypass in the AdvancePro Technologies Advanceware software suite. Specifically, the "id" parameter within the webserver URL is not properly validated and can be manipulated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control/Privilege Bypass:** The software fails to properly restrict access to order data based on user roles or permissions.
*  **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** Manipulating the "id" parameter in the URL allows an attacker to view orders belonging to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, including customer contact details, shipping information, and order specifics.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via web requests.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker directly modifies the "id" parameter within a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Advanceware software suite to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the webserver running the vulnerable application.
