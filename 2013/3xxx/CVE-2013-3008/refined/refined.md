    "impact": "Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to various impacts, including denial of service, information disclosure, and potentially arbitrary code execution. The severity is rated as critical.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerabilities are present in the IBM Java Runtime Environment and IBM Java Software Development Kit, implying that attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities through any means that involve processing Java code by vulnerable versions of the software. Some vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely through the network (e.g., those related to networking or JMX) or by processing crafted data (e.g., crafted images). Other vulnerabilities might require specific conditions, such as executing a malicious Java applet or application."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to supply malicious or crafted Java code to the target system or interact with a vulnerable application through the network. Depending on the vulnerability, the attacker may need to be able to execute code or interact with Java applets in a web browser or specific Java components within the system. Some of the flaws can be triggered remotely over the network."
