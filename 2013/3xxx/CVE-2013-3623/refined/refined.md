Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-3623:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `close_window.cgi` CGI application of Supermicro IPMI firmware.
*   The application uses the `strcpy()` function to copy user-supplied data from the `sess_sid` and `ACT` parameters into fixed-size stack buffers without any bounds checking.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** Two separate instances of buffer overflow exist, one each for the `sess_sid` and `ACT` parameters.  The `sess_sid` parameter is copied into a 20-byte buffer, and the `ACT` parameter into another 20-byte buffer using `strcpy()`.  Also,  `strcat()` is used on the `ACT` parameter which also leads to buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of these buffer overflows allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi/close_window.cgi` endpoint.
*   **Exploitable Parameters:** The `sess_sid` and `ACT` parameters within the POST request are the vectors for the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the IPMI web interface, which is typically accessible through port 80.
*   **No Authentication Required:** This vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication, as the vulnerable code is reachable by unauthenticated requests.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided Metasploit module leverages the `User-Agent` header to inject the shellcode, which will then be executed via the overflow on `close_window.cgi`.
*   The vulnerable firmware version identified in the exploit is SMT_X9_214. However, other versions might be vulnerable as well (e.g., SMT_X9_226).
*   Firmware version `SMT_X9_315` from Supermicro addresses this vulnerability by completely removing the `close_window.cgi` CGI application from the web interface.
*   The exploit uses a "ret2system" technique to gain RCE.
*   Thomas-Krenn confirmed the vulnerability on IPMI web interfaces of revision 2.24.
