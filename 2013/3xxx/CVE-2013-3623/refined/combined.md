# Supermicro IPMI Firmware Vulnerabilities

* Nov 06, 2013
* 4 min read
* [HD Moore](/blog/author/hd-moore/)

*Last updated at Thu, 28 Dec 2023 18:42:19 GMT*

## Introduction

This post summarizes the results of a limited security analysis of the Supermicro IPMI firmware. This firmware is used in the baseboard management controller (BMC) of many Supermicro motherboards.

The majority of our findings relate to firmware version SMT\_X9\_226. The information in this post was provided to Supermicro on August 22nd, 2013 in accordance with the Rapid7 vulnerability disclosure policy.

Although we have a number of Metasploit modules in development to test these issues, they are not quite ready for production use yet, so stay tuned for next week's Metasploit update. At our last count, over 35,000 Supermicro IPMI interfaces were exposed to the public internet.

Supermicro has published a new firmware version (SMT\_X9\_315) that appears to address many of the issues listed identified below, as well those reported by other researchers. We have updated each entry to indicate how the new firmware version impacts these issues.

A cursory review of the new firmware shows significant improvements, but we still recommend disconnecting the IPMI interface from untrusted networks and limiting access through another form of authentication (VPN, etc).

## Static Encryption Keys (CVE-2013-3619)

The firmware ships with harcoded private encryption keys for both the Lighttpd web server SSL interface and the Dropbear SSH daemon. An attacker with access to the publicly available Supermicro firmware can perform man-in-the-middle and offline decryption of communication to the firmware. The SSL keys can be updated by the user, but there is no option available to replace or regenerate SSH keys.

We have not been able to determine if firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 resolves this issue.

## Hardcoded WSMan Credentials (CVE-2013-3620)

The firmware contains two sets of credentials for the OpenWSMan interface. The first is the digest authentication file, which contains a single account with a static password. This password cannot be changed by the user and is effectively a backdoor. The second involves the basic authentication password file stored in the nv partition – it appears that due to a bug in the firmware, changing the password of the ADMIN account leaves the OpenWSMan password unchanged (still set to admin).

We have not been able to determine if firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 resolves this issue.

## CGI: login.cgi (CVE-2013-3621)

The login.cgi CGI application is vulnerable to two buffer overflows. The first occurs when processing the name parameter, the value is copied with strcpy() into a 128 byte buffer without any length checks. The second issue relates to the pwd parameter, the value is copied with strcpy() into a 24 byte buffer without any length checks. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities would result in remote code execution as the root user account. The vulnerable code is shown below (auto-generated from IDA Pro HexRays).

```
if ( cgiGetVariable("name") )
{
  v2 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("name");
  strcpy(&dest, v2);
}
if ( cgiGetVariable("pwd") )
{
  v3 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("pwd");
  strcpy(&v13, v3);
}

```

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 removes the use of strcpy() and limits the length of the name and pwd values to 64 and 20 respectively.

## CGI: close\_window.cgi (CVE-2013-3623)

The close\_window.cgi CGI application is vulnerable to two buffer overflows. The first issue occurs when processing the sess\_sid parameter, this value is copied with strcpy() to a 20-byte stack buffer without any length checks. The second issue occurs when processing the ACT parameter, this value is copied with strcpy() to a 20-byte stack buffer without any length checks. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities would result in remote code execution as the root user account. The vulnerable code is shown below (auto-generated from IDA Pro HexRays).

```
if ( cgiGetVariable("sess_sid") )
{
  v1 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("sess_sid");
  strcpy(&v19, v1);
}

...
if ( cgiGetVariable("ACT") )
{
  v3 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("ACT");
  strcat(&nptr, v3);
  ...

```

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 completely removes this CGI from the web interface.

## CGI: logout.cgi (CVE-2013-3622) [ authenticated ]

The logout.cgi CGI application is vulnerable to two buffer overflows. The first occurs when processing the SID parameter, the value is copied with strcpy() into a 20 byte buffer without any length checks. The second issue relates to further use of the SID parameter, the value is appended with strcat() into a 32 byte buffer without any length checks. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities would result in remote code execution as the root user account.The vulnerable code is shown below (auto-generated from IDA Pro HexRays).

```
if ( cgiGetVariable("SID") )
{
  v4 = (const char *)cgiGetVariable("SID");
  strcpy(&s, v4);
}

```

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 switches to a GetSessionCookie() function that limits the length of the SID variable returned to this code and no longer calls strcpy().

## CGI: url\_redirect.cgi (NO CVE) [ authenticated ]

The url\_redirect.cgi CGI application appears to be vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to lack of sanitization of the url\_name parameter. This may allow an attacker with a valid non-privileged account to access the contents of any file on the system. This includes the /nv/PSBlock file, which contains the clear-text credentials for all configured accounts, including the administrative user. The vulnerable code is shown below (auto-generated from IDA Pro HexRays).

```
sprintf(&v23, "%s/%s", *(_DWORD *)&ext_name_table[12 * i + 8], s);
v18 = fopen(&v23, "r");

```

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 appears to fix this issue.

## CGI: miscellaneous (NO CVE) [ authenticated ]

Numerous unbounded strcpy(), memcpy(), and sprint() calls are performed by the other 65 CGI applications available through the web interface. Most of these applications verify that the user has a valid session first, limiting exposure to authenticated users, but the review was not comprehensive. All instances of unsafe string and system command handling should be reviewed and corrected as necessary. Exploitation of these issues allows a low-privileged user to gain root access to the device.

Firmware version SMT\_X9\_315 has reorganized the web root, adding quite a few new CGI applications, removing many more, and generally purging the use of insecure functions like strcpy(). In addition, the config\_tftpd.cgi and snmp\_config.cgi CGI applications now validate that the user has a valid session first. They did not before, but it wasn't clear what risk this posed. In fact, the only two CGI applications that are now exposed to unauthenticated users are vmstatus.cgi and login.cgi.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

IPMI controller web interfaces of Supermicro X9 generation motherboards with firmware revision v2.24 and older are affected by several **vulnerabilities**, including critical **buffer overflows**. These vulnerabilities are a result of a safety analysis of the organization *Rapid7*. The following analyzes describe the discovery of these vulnerabilities:

* [Supermicro IPMI Firmware Vulnerabilities](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/11/06/supermicro-ipmi-firmware-vulnerabilities) (community.rapid7.com)
* [Exploiting the Supermicro Onboard IPMI Controller](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/11/15/exploiting-the-supermicro-onboard-ipmi-controller) (community.rapid7.com)

**This wiki article will provide more information about these security vulnerabilities and how to perform an update of the IPMI firmware.**

## General Safety Information

**We recommend to not operate administrative access such as IPMI and SSH services on the Internet, but rather enable access to authorized persons using a firewall/VPN.** This recommendation applies regardless of the vulnerabilities described here and is reinforced by Supermicro also: [Best Practices for managing servers with IPMI features enabled in Datacenters](http://www.supermicro.com/products/nfo/files/IPMI/Best_Practices_BMC_Security.pdf).

## Affected Firmware Versions

According to Rapid7 the vulnerabilities have been discovered in connection with the IPMI version SMT\_X9\_226.[[1]](#cite_note-ipmi-vuln-1) A corresponding exploit for the buffer overflow has been created using an IPMI version SMT\_X9\_214 by Rapid7. [[2]](#cite_note-ipmi-expl-2)
The utilization of the vulnerability was verified by Thomas-Krenn in the *close\_window.cg* with an IPMI web interface of revision 2.24.

The following selected Thomas Krenn motherboards are affected:

* X9 Mainboards for Intel CPUs (IPMI revision before v2.24): [X9SCA-F](/en/wiki/X9SCA-F "X9SCA-F"), [X9SCM-F](/en/wiki/X9SCM-F "X9SCM-F"), [X9DBL-iF](/en/wiki/X9DBL-iF "X9DBL-iF"), [X9DR7-LN4F](/en/wiki/X9DR7-LN4F "X9DR7-LN4F"), [X9DRi-F](/en/wiki/X9DRi-F "X9DRi-F"), [X9DRW-3LN4F+](/en/wiki/X9DRW-3LN4F%2B "X9DRW-3LN4F+"), X9DRT-HF, 5037MC-H8TRF (X9SCD-F), SYS-2027TR-H71RF

## Details

The CGI scripts *login.cgi* and *close\_window.cgi* of the IPMI web interface are exploitable by buffer overflows.[[1]](#cite_note-ipmi-vuln-1) The vulnerabilities are a result of the usage of *strcpy* and *strcat* without string length validation.

For the vulnerability of the CGI script *close\_window.cgi* a functional exploit has been published. An attacker can run root commands without previous authentication.[[2]](#cite_note-ipmi-expl-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3)

## Impacts

An attacker with network access to port 80 of the IPMI ip address can enforce a buffer overflow by sending arbitrary requests. If the vulnerability is exploited successfully the attacker can run commands with root privileges on the IPMI-BMC ([Arbitrary Code Execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution)).

## Counter Measures

According to Supermicro the following security vulnerabilities are fixed by revision SMT\_X9\_315:[[4]](#cite_note-4)

* Hardcoded WSMan Credentials (CVE-2013-3620)
* CGI: login.cgi (CVE-2013-3621)
* CGI: close\_window.cgi (CVE-2013-3623)
* Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CVE-2013-3607)
* Improper Input Validation (CVE-2013-3608)
* Improper Privilege Management (CVE-2013-3609)

**Attention:** Supermicro states that changes in the password management algorithms will not allow a downgrade from versions 3.x to versions 2.x.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

The following IPMI firmware revision fixes the vulnerabilities:

* X9 Mainboards for Intel CPUs: [X9SCA-F](/en/wiki/X9SCA-F "X9SCA-F"), [X9SCM-F](/en/wiki/X9SCM-F "X9SCM-F"), [X9DBL-iF](/en/wiki/X9DBL-iF "X9DBL-iF"), [X9DR7-LN4F](/en/wiki/X9DR7-LN4F "X9DR7-LN4F"), [X9DRi-F](/en/wiki/X9DRi-F "X9DRi-F"), [X9DRW-3LN4F+](/en/wiki/X9DRW-3LN4F%2B "X9DRW-3LN4F+"), X9DRT-HF, 5037MC-H8TRF (X9SCD-F), SYS-2027TR-H71RF

**Thomas Krenn strongly recommends that all affected customers apply IPMI firmware updates and not to operate administrative access such as IPMI or SSH services on the Internet. Rather allow access to authorized persons only via a firewall/VPN.**
