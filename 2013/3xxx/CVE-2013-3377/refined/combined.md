Details  * **Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software SIP Denial of Service Vulnerabilities**      Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software contains two different vulnerabilities in the implementation of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition.   Both vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of crafted SIP packets sent to the affected system. An attacker could exploit both vulnerabilities by sending crafted SIP packets to the affected system.      The first vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue01743](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue01743) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3377.   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause a reload of the affected system.      The second vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuf89557](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf89557) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3378.   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause the affected system to become unresponsive for a certain amount of time. Repeated exploitation may lead to a denial of service condition.      **Cisco TelePresence TC Software Adjacent root Access Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the implementation of firewall rules could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain *root* shell access to an affected system.      The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of allowed hosts in the firewall rules. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the management IP address of the affected system. The attacker would need to be logically or physically adjacent to exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain *root* access to the shell.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCts37781](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts37781) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3379.  Workarounds  * **Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software SIP Denial of Service Vulnerabilities**      If SIP it is not in use, a possible workaround for these vulnerabilities can be achieved by disabling the SIP service: set the **NetworkServices** SIP Mode to Off by issuing the following xCommand: ```   xConfiguration NetworkServices SIP Mode: Off   ``` Alternatively, administrators can use the web interface to disable the SIP service: navigate to **Configuration > Advanced Configuration > Network Services** and set the SIP mode to Off.      **Cisco TelePresence TC Software Adjacent root Access Vulnerability**      There is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * **Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software SIP Denial of Service Vulnerabilities**      The following table indicates the fixed releases for Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software for the vulnerability identified by Cisco bug ID CSCue01743 and CVE ID CVE-2013-3377 for each of the affected products:         | **Products** | **Affected Releases** | **Resolved In** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco TelePresence MX Series | TC5.x and earlier | TC5.1.7 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence System EX Series | TC5.x and earlier | TC5.1.7 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence System EX Series | TE6.0 | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Integrator C Series | TC5.x and earlier | TC5.1.7 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Profiles Series | TC5.x and earlier | TC5.1.7 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Quick Set Series | TC5.x and earlier | TC5.1.7 or later |   | Cisco IP Video Phone E20 | TE4.x and earlier | TE4.1.3 |         The following table provides information about the fixed releases for Cisco TelePresence TC   and TE Software referring to the vulnerability identified by Cisco bug   ID CSCuf89557 and CVE ID CVE-2013-3378 for each of the affected products:      | **Products** | **Affected Releases** | **Resolved In** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco TelePresence MX Series | TC6.x and earlier | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence System EX Series | TC6.x and earlier | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence System EX Series | TE6.0 | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Integrator C Series | TC6.x and earlier | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Profiles Series | TC6.x and earlier | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Quick Set Series | TC6.x and earlier | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco IP Video Phone E20 | TE4.x and earlier | TE4.1.3 |         **Cisco TelePresence TC Software Adjacent root Access Vulnerability**      The table below gives information about the fixed releases for the Cisco TelePresence TC Software Adjacent root Access Vulnerability for each of the affected products:      | **Products** | **Affected Releases** | **Resolved In** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco TelePresence MX Series | TC4.1 and earlier | TC4.2 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence System EX Series | TC4.1 and earlier | TC4.2 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Integrator C Series | TC4.1 and earlier | TC4.2 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Profiles Series | TC4.1 and earlier | TC4.2 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Quick Set Series | TC4.1 and earlier | TC4.2 or later |         **Recommended Releases**      The following table provides information about recommended releases for Cisco TelePresence TC   and TE Software that resolve all the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:      | **Products** | **Recommended Release** |   | --- | --- |   | Cisco TelePresence MX Series | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence System EX Series | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence System EX Series | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco Telepresence Integrator C Series | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Profiles Series | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco TelePresence Quick Set Series | TC6.1 or later |   | Cisco IP Video Phone E20 | TE4.1.3 |         **Note:** Cisco TelePresence TE Software version 4.1.3 for Cisco IP Video Phone E20 will be available on June 30, 2013.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.
