Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The crypto API in the Linux kernel did not initialize certain length variables. Specifically, the `msg_namelen` member in the `msghdr` structure was not set to zero in `hash_recvmsg` function in `crypto/algif_hash.c` and the `skcipher_recvmsg` function in `crypto/algif_skcipher.c`
- This missing initialization caused `net/socket.c` to leak local `sockaddr_storage` variable from kernel stack memory to userland.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak. Because `msg_namelen` wasn't being properly initialized, the kernel was unintentionally sending kernel stack memory to user-space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Exposure:** Local unprivileged users can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory. This could potentially expose various secrets such as cryptographic keys, passwords, or other sensitive data present in kernel memory at the time.
- It was possible to leak up to 128 bytes of kernel stack memory

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users who can execute code on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the affected system and be able to call the vulnerable `recvmsg(2)` or `recvfrom(2)` system calls.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `hash_recvmsg` function within `crypto/algif_hash.c` and `skcipher_recvmsg` function within `crypto/algif_skcipher.c`.
*   The fix involves setting `msg->msg_namelen = 0` to prevent the leak of kernel stack data.
*   The vulnerable functions are part of the Linux kernel's crypto API, and are used when handling socket messages related to hash and skcipher algorithms.
*   The issue occurs because the kernel is not explicitly setting the length of the name field ( `msg_namelen` ) in the message header before returning the message to the user, resulting in the unintended transmission of potentially sensitive kernel stack data.
*   The issue existed since the introduction of AF_ALG in linux kernel v2.6.38.
*   The fix for the issue is available in the following commit: `72a763d805a48ac8c0bf48fdb510e84c12de51fe`

**Summary:**
CVE-2013-3076 is a kernel information leak vulnerability that allows local users to potentially obtain sensitive data from kernel stack memory by using `recvmsg()` or `recvfrom()` system calls on specially crafted sockets using the crypto API's hash or skcipher interfaces. The root cause is the missing initialization of `msg_namelen` within the handling of those messages, leading to the leak of up to 128 bytes of kernel stack memory.
