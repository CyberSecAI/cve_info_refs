Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL Injection (iSQL) flaw present in Simple PHP Agenda version 2.2.8 and earlier.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `edit_event.php` file, relying solely on `mysql_real_escape_string()` which is insufficient.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary weakness is the lack of adequate input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially dump sensitive information from the database, including user login credentials (usernames and passwords).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation can lead to an attacker gaining administrator-level access to the application and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL targeting the `edit_event.php` file.
*   **`eventid` Parameter:** Specifically, the `eventid` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the vulnerable Simple PHP Agenda application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the target application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit leverages a `UNION SELECT` statement within the `eventid` parameter to extract data from the `users` table, targeting admin accounts (`userlevel=9`).
*   The exploit example given in the content is: `http://server/edit_event.php?eventid=1%20union%20select%201,2,3,username,password,6,7,8,9%20from%20users%20where%20userlevel=9%20limit%200,1`

**Mitigation:**

*   The recommended solution is to properly sanitize all GET and POST parameters and not rely solely on `mysql_real_escape_string()`.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was discovered by Anthony Dubuissez of Webera.
*  A fix was released by the vendor in version 2.2.9.
