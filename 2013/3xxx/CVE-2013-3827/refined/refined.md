Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3827:

**Vulnerability Description:**

The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the Mojarra JSF2 implementation of Oracle JavaServer Faces. It allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to access sensitive information by traversing directories within the web application. This occurs when the application uses the JSF suffix ".jsf" and does not exclude certain file extensions (like ".xml")

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is improper handling of resource identifiers and library names in the JavaServer Faces implementation. Specifically, the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input used to construct paths, resulting in the ability to perform directory traversal within the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Partial Directory Traversal via Resource Identifier:**  An attacker can use a crafted URL containing `javax.faces.resource.../` followed by directory traversal sequences to access files within the application's `WEB-INF` directory.
*   **Partial Directory Traversal via Library Name:** Similarly, an attacker can exploit the `ln` parameter in a URL containing `javax.faces.resource.` to achieve directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access sensitive files within the web application's deployment directory, like `WEB-INF/web.xml`, potentially exposing configuration details, credentials, or other confidential data. The directory traversal is limited, and arbitrary files outside of the application cannot be accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP GET requests containing directory traversal sequences within the resource identifier or library name parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network without needing prior authentication to the target system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Alex Kouzemtchenko and Jon Passki of Coverity Security Research Labs.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2013.
*   Red Hat also addressed the issue in Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.2.0.

**Summary of Vulnerable Code:**

The vulnerability lies within the Mojarra JSF2 implementation where the resource identifier or library name parameter is used to construct a file path. The code fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the attacker to control parts of the file path.

The provided documents detail how a request such as:

```
http://www.example.com/someApp/javax.faces.resource.../WEB-INF/web.xml.jsf
```

or

```
http://www.example.com/someApp/javax.faces.resource./WEB-INF/web.xml.jsf?ln=
```

could be used to access the web.xml file.

The Red Hat advisory specifically mentions that "Multiple path traversal flaws where found in the Mojarra JSF2 implementation for identifying resources by name or by library." This description is consistent with the other documents.

This vulnerability was rated as having a CVSS base score of 5.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N) in the Oracle document.
