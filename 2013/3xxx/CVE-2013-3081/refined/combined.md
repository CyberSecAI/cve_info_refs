Would you mind if I replaced your regexp with [PHP Filter Validation](http://php.net/manual/en/filter.examples.validation.php) (to use a "built-in" function)? Or is the regexp doing something extra?

We could even wrap it in Jojo::validateIP() or Jojo::sanitiseIP() to make it easier to use in other places too.

Sorry, something went wrong.

The regex simply validates the IP format and returns true/false, nothing
more. If there's a built-in method that runs faster and does the same
thing without compromising compatibility, go for it.
