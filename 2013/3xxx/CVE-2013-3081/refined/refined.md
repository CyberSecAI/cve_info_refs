Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `checkEmailFormat` function within the `Jojo.php` file of the Jojo CMS. Specifically, the application uses the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header without proper sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of the `X-Forwarded-For` header before its use in an SQL query. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize user-supplied input from the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** A successful attack allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the server. This could lead to:
    - Data breaches: Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.
    - System compromise: Potentially gaining control of the database server.
    - Denial of service: Disrupting the normal operations of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header in a request to the `/articles/test/` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/articles/test/`) and that the application processes the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `plugins/jojo_core/classes/Jojo.php` in Jojo CMS before version 1.2.2.
- The provided commit `972757c` shows a fix for the SQL injection issue, however it appears to only focus on IP address format validation, not SQL injection, so it is unclear if this actually fixes the vulnerability.
- The fix does not involve PHP Filter Validation as suggested in comments but uses a regex to validate IP address formats, this would not be an effective defense against SQL injection.
