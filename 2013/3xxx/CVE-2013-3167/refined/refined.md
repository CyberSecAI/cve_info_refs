Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3167:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) improperly handling objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory management leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to an information disclosure, which can then be leveraged to achieve elevation of privileges, allowing an attacker to run processes in an elevated context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need valid logon credentials and be able to log on to the system.
- A specially crafted application would then be executed to exploit the improper handling of objects in memory by the win32k.sys driver, ultimately leaking information that can be used for further exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to log on to the system.
- Ability to execute a specially crafted application.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is located in `win32k.sys`, which is a core component of the Windows subsystem responsible for window management, screen output, user input, and graphics.
- Microsoft stated that they received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
- The provided content indicates that while this CVE is categorized as an information disclosure vulnerability, it could lead to elevation of privilege.

This CVE is part of a group of vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-053.
