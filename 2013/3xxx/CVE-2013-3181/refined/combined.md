# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-060 - Critical

## Vulnerability in Unicode Scripts Processor Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2850869)

Published: August 13, 2013

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the Unicode Scripts Processor included in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted document or webpage with an application that supports embedded OpenType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Windows parses specific characteristics of OpenType fonts. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Uniscribe Font Parsing Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3181

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Unicode Scripts Processor included in affected versions of Microsoft Windows. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the current user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3181](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3181).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.

* **Modify the Access Control List (ACL) on usp10.dll**

  Modify the ACL on usp10.dll to be more restrictive.

  For 32-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:

  `cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\usp10.DLL /E /P everyone:N`

  For 64-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:

  `cacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\usp10.DLL /E /P everyone:N`

  **Impact of workaround.** FireFox may not load. Some fonts may not render properly.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  For 32-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:

  `cacls %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\usp10.dll /E /R everyone`

  For 64-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, run the following commands from a command prompt with administrative privileges:

  `cacls %WINDIR%\SYSWOW64\usp10.dll /E /R everyone`
* **Disable support for parsing embedded fonts in Internet Explorer**

  Disabling the support for the parsing of embedded fonts in Internet Explorer prevents this application from being used as an attack vector. However, additional attack vectors, such as embedded fonts within a Microsoft Office document, could still succeed.

  **Using the Interactive Method**

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the Tools menu
  2. Click the **Security** tab
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**
  4. Scroll down to the **Downloads** section and select **Prompt** or **Disable** for the **Font Downloading** security setting
  5. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer

  **Using Group Policy**

  **Note** The Group Policy MMC snap-in can be used to set policy for a machine, for an organizational unit or an entire domain. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Group Policy collection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).

  Perform the following steps:

  1. Open the Group Policy Management Console and configure the console to work with the appropriate Group Policy object, such as local machine, OU, or domain GPO.
  2. Navigate to the following node:
     User Configuration - Windows Settings - Internet Explorer - Maintenance - Security
  3. Double-click **Security Zones and Content Rating.**
  4. In the Security Zones and Content Rating dialog box, select **Import the current security zones and privacy settings** and then click the **Modify Settings** button.

     **Note** This will create a Group Policy for Internet Explorer based on the settings of the currently logged-on user.
  5. In the **Internet Properties** dialog box, ensure the **Internet** zone is selected and then click **Custom Level.**
  6. Scroll down to **Downloads** and set **Font Download** to **Prompt** or **Disable.**
  7. Click **OK** to return to the Internet Properties dialog box.
  8. Repeat these steps for the **Local Intranet** zone.
  9. Click **OK** three times to return to the Group Policy Management Console.
  10. Refresh the Group Policy on all machines or wait for the next scheduled Group Policy refresh interval for the settings to take effect.

  **Using a Managed Deployment Script**

  This security setting can be manually entered into the registry by creating a registry script and importing it either by double-clicking it or running regedit.exe as part of a logon or machine startup script. For managed deployments Regedit.exe can be used to import a registry script silently with the **/s** switch. For more information on regedit command line switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 82821](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/q82821/), "Registration Info Editor (REGEDIT) Command-Line Switches."

  To set to **Prompt** for the Internet and Local Intranet Zones, paste the following text into a .REG file and then import the .REG file on managed machines as part of your organization's managed deployment process:

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  ; Zone 1 is the local intranet zone
  ; 1604 is the Font download policy
  ; dword:00000001 sets the policy to prompt
  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1]
  "1604"=dword:00000001
  ; Zone 3 is the internet zone
  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3]
  "1604"=dword:00000001

  To set to **Disable** for the Internet and Local Intranet Zones, paste the following text into a .REG file and then import the .REG file on managed machines as part of your organization's managed deployment process:

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  ; Zone 1 is the local intranet zone
  ; 1604 is the Font download policy
  ; dword:00000003 sets the policy to disable
  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1]
  "1604"=dword:00000003
  ; Zone 3 is the internet zone
  [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3]
  "1604"=dword:00000003

  **Impact of workaround.** Web pages that make use of embedded font technology will fail to display properly.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Unicode Scripts Processor, included in affected versions of Microsoft Windows, incorrectly parses specific font types in a way that corrupts memory and allows for arbitrary code to be executed.

**What is the Unicode Script Processor?**

The Unicode Script Processor (USP10.DLL), also known as Uniscribe, is a collection of APIs that enables a text layout client to format complex scripts. Uniscribe supports the complex rules found in scripts such as Arabic, Indian, and Thai. Uniscribe also handles scripts written from right-to-left such as Arabic or Hebrew, and supports the mixing of scripts. For plain-text clients, Uniscribe provides a range of ScriptString functions that are similar to TextOut, with additional support for caret placement. The remainder of the Uniscribe interfaces provides finer control to clients.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

The Unicode Scripts Processor is a Windows component which may be used by both Microsoft software and third-party applications.

An attacker could leverage a web browser to exploit this vulnerability. For example, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker could leverage an application that supports embedded OpenType fonts to exploit this vulnerability. For example, an attacker could send a specially crafted document associated with an application that supports embedded OpenType fonts to a user and convince the user to open the file.

Note that an application could only be leveraged to exploit this vulnerability if the application used a vulnerable version of USP10.DLL in an affected version of Microsoft Windows.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Desktop machines or terminal servers where users may view content that could contain malformed OpenType fonts are particularly at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Windows parses specific characteristics of OpenType fonts.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
