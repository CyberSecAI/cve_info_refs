Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-3181:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Unicode Scripts Processor (usp10.dll), also known as Uniscribe, which is a component of Microsoft Windows responsible for handling complex text layouts.
*   The vulnerability is caused by the incorrect parsing of specific characteristics of OpenType fonts. This faulty parsing leads to memory corruption, which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is a memory corruption vulnerability arising from improper handling of OpenType fonts. The vulnerability exists in the way the Unicode Scripts Processor parses and processes specific characteristics of the embedded fonts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gains the same user rights as the currently logged-in user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new user accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attacks:**
    *   An attacker could host a malicious webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability using Internet Explorer.
    *   Compromised websites, or websites that accept user-provided content, could host malicious content, exploiting the vulnerability when visited by users.
    *   Attackers trick users into clicking on links in emails or instant messages leading to the malicious websites.
*   **Application-Based Attacks:**
    *   Attackers can send users specially crafted documents associated with applications that support embedded OpenType fonts.
    *   If such applications use a vulnerable version of USP10.DLL, opening these documents can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host or inject malicious content:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject specially crafted content (webpages or documents with manipulated OpenType fonts).
*   **Social engineering:** The attacker typically needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious content (clicking links, opening attachments).
*   **Target User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to take an action, like visiting a compromised webpage or opening a malicious document.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Other versions of Windows are not affected.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Applying the security updates provided by Microsoft is the primary solution.
    *   Workarounds include modifying the ACL on usp10.dll and disabling embedded font support in Internet Explorer, but these could impair functionality.
