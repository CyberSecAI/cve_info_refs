Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3874:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing an object in memory. This improper access can corrupt memory, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer. This is a type of use-after-free or similar memory management error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user.
- **Full System Control:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new user accounts with full rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince the user to visit it.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can take advantage of compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content/ads to include malicious content to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Phishing:** Attackers might use phishing emails or instant messages containing links that lead users to the malicious website, or attachments that when opened exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host or control a website with malicious content.
- The attacker needs to persuade the user to interact with that website (e.g., by clicking a link or opening a file).
- No specific position within the network is required, as this is primarily a client-side vulnerability. The attack can be launched remotely.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-080.
- The update modifies how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- This bulletin also addresses other vulnerabilities, as changes needed for each vulnerability are in related files.
- The vulnerability is rated as 'Critical' for client versions of Windows and 'Moderate' for server versions.
- Mitigation includes using Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers, which restricts Internet Explorer. EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) also helps to mitigate this vulnerability when configured correctly.
- Workarounds include setting security zones to "High" to block ActiveX controls and active scripting or configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running active scripting.
- The vulnerability was privately reported to Microsoft by Amol Naik, working with HP's Zero Day Initiative and by an anonymous researcher working with VeriSign iDefense Labs.
