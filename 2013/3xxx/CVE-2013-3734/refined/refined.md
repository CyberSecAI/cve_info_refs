         "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the password, despite being masked in the UI, is included in plain text within the HTML source code. This allows an attacker with administrative access to view the source and extract the database password. The vulnerability is exacerbated when SSL is not enabled because it exposes the password on the wire. The vendor does not consider this a security flaw because administrative users have access to reset the password."
