Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper processing of script by Internet Explorer during webpage debugging. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: Specifically, the vulnerability allows for memory corruption through improper script handling during debugging.
- Improper access of objects in memory.
- Remote Code Execution: If the memory is corrupted in a specific way, it allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user of Internet Explorer.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain full control over the system, allowing them to install software, change data, or create new accounts with admin rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the website.
- **Exploiting Script Debugging:**
    - The attacker would need to convince the user to initiate script debugging while visiting a malicious website. This can be done by pressing F12 to open developer tools and then starting debugging from the Script tab.
    - In non-default configurations, with script debugging enabled, if the webpage contains script errors, users could be prompted to debug. The attacker would need to convince them to accept such prompt.
- **Compromised/Malicious Websites:** An attacker could also inject malicious content onto compromised websites or those that host user-generated content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious website or compromise an existing one.
- Ability to use social engineering tactics to lure users to the malicious content and make them debug the malicious script.
- No required position on the targeted network.

**Additional Notes:**
- By default, script debugging is not enabled in Internet Explorer.
- Internet Explorer running in Enhanced Security Configuration (default on Windows Servers) mitigates this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the browser improperly handles objects in memory during a debugging session of a webpage.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security update.
- Microsoft had not received any reports of active exploitation at the time of the bulletin's release.
