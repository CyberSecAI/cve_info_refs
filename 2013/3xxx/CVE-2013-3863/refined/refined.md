Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-3863:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Windows handles OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects in memory. Specifically, the way OLE objects are handled in memory is incorrect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of OLE objects in memory.
- This allows for remote code execution by opening a file with a specially crafted OLE object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user.
- Complete system control: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take full control of the system, install programs, modify data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- Data manipulation: Attackers can view, change, or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email attachments: The primary attack vector involves a user opening a file, such as an Office document or other file types that supports OLE objects, that contains a malicious OLE object sent as an attachment to an email.
- User interaction is required: A user must open the malicious file for the exploit to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious file containing a specifically designed OLE object.
- The attacker has to convince the victim to open the malicious file, typically delivered via email.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as Critical for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
- The provided information indicates this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed nor exploited in the wild prior to the release of the security bulletin.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way OLE objects are handled in memory
