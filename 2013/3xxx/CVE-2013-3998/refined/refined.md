Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3998:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from HTTP response splitting and open redirect issues in IBM InfoSphere BigInsights.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HTTP Response Splitting: This occurs when an attacker can inject characters such as CR (carriage return) and LF (line feed) into HTTP headers. This can allow the attacker to control subsequent headers and even the response body, leading to various attacks.
- Open Redirect: This vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary malicious website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially redirect users to malicious sites, leading to phishing or malware distribution.
- HTTP response splitting can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or cache poisoning.
- The attacker could manipulate the response to perform unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities can be exploited by manipulating HTTP requests. Specifically, injection of CR and LF characters into HTTP headers or manipulating redirect parameters could be used to trigger these vulnerabilities.
- The exact method of injecting malicious data or redirect URLs was not specified in the provided bulletin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable InfoSphere BigInsights server.
- The attacker does not require any specific privileges within the target system, aside from the ability to send requests to the server.
- The attacker could be external to the network hosting the server.

**Additional Notes:**
- This bulletin indicates that versions 1.1 through 2.1 of IBM InfoSphere BigInsights are affected.
- The fix for version 2.1 is to install Fix Pack 2, while users of versions 1.1 to 2.0 should contact customer support for remediation.
- This vulnerability is grouped with CVE-2013-3997.
- The bulletin is dated 19 March 2014, with a modified date of 08 April 2021.
