- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User passwords are hashed using a weak 48-bit algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The use of a weak hashing algorithm (48-bit) makes user passwords susceptible to brute-force attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the system by cracking user passwords, potentially compromising the confidentiality and integrity of data and potentially causing a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable through brute-force password cracking.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to access the password hashes, typically through access to the DVR system.
