Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3247:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the XCF file format processor of XnView. Specifically, the content mentions heap overflow and stack overflow vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Heap overflow
*   Stack overflow

**Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerabilities allow for arbitrary code execution within the context of the XnView application. This means a successful exploit could give the attacker control over the system where XnView is running.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the processing of specially crafted XCF files. An attacker would need to get a user to open a malicious XCF file in a vulnerable version of XnView.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify an XCF file. The user must then open this file with XnView.

**Additional details:** The content indicates that multiple vulnerabilities were found during fuzzing, including at least one that leads to code execution. The content also mentions that two of the vulnerabilities were reported to Secunia. A demonstration of exploitation is available via a YouTube link.
