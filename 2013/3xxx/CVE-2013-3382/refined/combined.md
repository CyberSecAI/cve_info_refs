Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following versions of Cisco ASA NGFW are affected by the vulnerability in this advisory:    9.1.1 versions of Cisco ASA NGFW prior to 9.1.1.9    9.1.2 versions of Cisco NGFW prior to 9.1.2.12    All 9.0 versions of Cisco NGFW          **Note:** Both Cisco ASA NGFW hardware and software modules for Cisco ASA are affected by this vulnerability.         **Determining Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall Services Software Versions**      Cisco ASA NGFW is known as Cisco ASA CX Context-Aware Security in versions prior to 9.1.2.       To determine the running version of Cisco ASA NGFW software, issue the **show version** command from the Cisco ASA NGFW command line interface, to which an administrator can get access via serial console, an SSH session to the ASA NGFW management interface, or a session opened from the parent ASA using the **session** command.       The following example shows Cisco ASA NGFW software Version 9.0.1(40):   ```   	asangfw> show version   	Cisco ASA CX Platform  9.0.1 (40)            ```   Customers using Cisco Prime Security Manager (PRSM )to manage Cisco ASA NGFW devices can locate the software version of Cisco **ASA NGFW in the Device > Devices** part of the Cisco Prime Security Manager window.   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco Catalyst 6500 or 7600 Series ASA Services Module (ASA-SM), and Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Firewall Services Module (FWSM) are not affected by this vulnerability.   Cisco PRSM is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The Cisco ASA NGFW is an add-on services module that extends the Cisco ASA platform by delivering application and user ID awareness capabilities for enhanced visibility and control of network traffic.      A vulnerability in fragmented traffic processing on Cisco ASA NGFW could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.      The vulnerability is due to invalid parsing of reassembled packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented traffic to be processed by one of the ASA NGFW deny policies.      Under specific conditions, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets through the Cisco ASA NGFW. To exploit this vulnerability, an affected Cisco ASA NGFW must have a configured policy that denies user traffic. Processing fragmented packets against a deny policy, could cause the Cisco ASA NGFW to reload.   Additionally, if the Cisco ASA, with a Cisco ASA NGFW module running an affected version of software is configured in High-Availability mode (HA), a failover event may be triggered when the Cisco ASA NGFW reloads or stops forwarding traffic.      Only user traffic specifically directed towards the Cisco ASA NGFW by the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the parent Cisco ASA is affected by the vulnerability in this advisory.    Management traffic to or from Cisco ASA NGFW is not affected by this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue88387](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue88387) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall Services and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3382.  Workarounds  * If the vulnerability has been exploited on the Cisco ASA NGFW and the traffic is interrupted, as a mitigation, the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the Cisco ASA that is used to direct the user traffic toward the Cisco ASA NGFW can be removed. This will cause all user traffic to bypass Cisco ASA NGFW module inspection and allow it to pass through the Cisco ASA without inspection provided by the ASA NGFW.      The following example shows how to disable the redirecting of web traffic to the Cisco ASA NGFW module from the Cisco ASA firewall:       ```   ASA(config)# policy-map cx_traffic_policy   ASA(config-pmap)# class cx_traffic   ASA(config-pmap-c)# no cxcs      ```       **Note:** Cisco ASA can be configured with **fail-open** under MPF configuration. The **fail-open** keyword sets the Cisco ASA to allow all traffic through, uninspected, if the Cisco ASA NGFW module is unavailable.      Alternatively, fragmented traffic can be disallowed on the Cisco ASA firewall. This will cause the Cisco ASA firewall not to accept any fragments on its interfaces. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not send any fragments to the Cisco ASA NGFW software module for inspection.      The following example shows how to disable processing of fragmented traffic on the Cisco ASA firewall:       ```   ASA(config)# fragment chain 1    ``` **Note:** The above example will disable fragments on all the Cisco ASA interfaces. Fragmented traffic directed to and through the Cisco ASA will be dropped. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not forward any fragmented traffic to the Cisco ASA NGFW or any of the configured modules.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       This vulnerability has been fixed in Cisco ASA NGFW versions 9.1.1.9 or 9.1.2.12 and later.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.8 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.8 |
