Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-3382:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) module's improper parsing of reassembled fragmented packet data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Invalid Parsing:** The core issue is the flawed handling of reassembled packet fragments, specifically when processed against a deny policy in the Cisco ASA NGFW.
*   **Deny Policy Trigger:** The vulnerability is triggered when fragmented traffic is processed by the ASA NGFW module after being matched against a configured policy that denies user traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability to cause a reload of the affected Cisco ASA NGFW device.
*   **Traffic Interruption:** This reload results in the interruption of traffic being processed by the ASA NGFW module.
*   **Failover:** If the Cisco ASA with the vulnerable NGFW module is configured in High Availability (HA) mode, the reload or traffic halt can trigger a failover event.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attacker does not need any authentication or prior access.
*   **Fragmented Packets:** The attacker sends specially crafted fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets.
*   **Traffic Redirection:** The attack targets user traffic that the parent Cisco ASA is configured to redirect to the Cisco ASA NGFW module for inspection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to send fragmented traffic to a vulnerable Cisco ASA NGFW device.
*   **Target Configuration:** The target ASA NGFW must be configured with a deny policy for user traffic.
*   **No Special Privileges:** No special privileges or credentials are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in specific versions of Cisco ASA NGFW software, including 9.0, 9.1.1 (prior to 9.1.1.9), and 9.1.2 (prior to 9.1.2.12).
*   The vulnerability affects both hardware and software modules of Cisco ASA NGFW.
*   Management traffic to or from the Cisco ASA NGFW is not affected.
*   Workarounds include disabling traffic redirection to the ASA NGFW module or disabling fragmented traffic processing on the ASA firewall.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during a support case resolution and not by public announcement.
*   CVSS v2 score: Base 7.8, Temporal 6.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C)
