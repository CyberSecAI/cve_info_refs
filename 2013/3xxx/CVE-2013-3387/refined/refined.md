Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2013-3387 is a **disk exhaustion vulnerability** within Cisco Prime Central for HCS Assurance.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The specific weakness is the system's susceptibility to **excessive logging**. A TCP connection flood to the Omnibus Port (TCP 5400) triggers the generation of numerous error logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation leads to a **denial-of-service (DoS)** condition. The continuous generation of logs fills up the server's disk space until it is exhausted. This makes the server unresponsive.
*   The system is unable to function properly due to the lack of disk space.
*   The system remains in a DoS state until the log files are manually removed and the server recovers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **network-based**.
*   An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send a sustained **TCP connection flood** to the vulnerable TCP port (5400).
*   No authentication is required. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Details:**
* The affected product is Cisco Prime Central for HCS Assurance (versions 8.6, 9.0, and 9.1).
* The vulnerability is associated with Cisco bug ID CSCua42724.
* The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C).
