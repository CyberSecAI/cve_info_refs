Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper memory access can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability. This occurs when Internet Explorer improperly handles objects in memory, leading to exploitable memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means the attacker's code runs with the same privileges as the user browsing the malicious webpage.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system.
- Potential for installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack scenario:
    - Attackers host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    - Attackers can also compromise legitimate websites or use sites that host user-provided content/ads to deliver the exploit.
- Social engineering: Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious website, typically via:
    - Clicking a link in an email or instant message.
    - Opening an email attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host or inject malicious content into a website.
- Ability to trick a user into visiting the malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**
- This CVE is one of several memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed in the same Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS13-059).
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6 through 10) on various Windows operating systems.
- The provided text does not indicate that this vulnerability was publicly disclosed or exploited before the patch was released.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) helps to mitigate the risk of exploitation if configured correctly.
