Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of a default secret key in SLMS (SUSE Lifecycle Management Server) that was present in the git repository.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded/Default Key:** The primary weakness is the existence of a default secret key within the source code (git). Using default or hardcoded keys is a major security risk because it makes it easier for attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions if they can obtain the key.
- **Inadequate File Permissions:** The update also addresses the fact that files containing the keys were not restricted to read-only access by SLMS, which could potentially lead to exposure of the keys by unauthorized users/processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If an attacker were to obtain the default secret key, they could potentially gain unauthorized access to the SLMS system, leading to various malicious activities, such as data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Code Repository Access:** An attacker could potentially obtain the default key by accessing the git repository where the SLMS source code was stored.
- **File System Access:** if an attacker had access to the file system with insufficient permissions set on key files, they could have potentially accessed keys.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Access:** The attacker needs access to the SLMS source code repository or the vulnerable key file within an installation.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and where the default key is located.

**Additional Details:**
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that the secret key is always generated and that files containing keys are readable only by SLMS.
