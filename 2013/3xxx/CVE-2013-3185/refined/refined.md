Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-3185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) instance exposing service account information through an open endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The core issue is the unintentional disclosure of sensitive account information related to the service account used by AD FS. This information should not be publicly accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Exposure: An attacker can gain knowledge of the service account used by AD FS.
- Potential Denial of Service: After obtaining the service account information, an attacker could attempt logons from outside the corporate network. If an account lockout policy is in place, these failed login attempts would lock the service account, resulting in a denial of service for all applications relying on the AD FS instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by interacting with the exposed endpoint of the AD FS service, potentially from outside the corporate network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable AD FS endpoint. This could involve network connectivity to the service, although the document doesn't specify whether it needs to be an internal network or can be accessed from the internet.
- The attacker needs the capability to trigger the vulnerability that exposes the account information.
- The attacker needs the capability to use the exposed information to attempt unauthorized logons.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of AD FS (1.x, 2.0 and 2.1) on different Windows Server versions.
- The severity rating is "Important" for AD FS 2.0 and 2.1, while for AD FS 1.x, no severity rating is given, because default configurations prevent direct attacks. However, Microsoft recommends applying the update for all affected versions as a defense-in-depth measure.
- The provided documents clarify that the vulnerability is not exploitable on Server Core installations and also specifies the update numbers for each affected version.
- Microsoft was not aware of any exploitation in the wild when the security bulletin was originally issued.
- This vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly disclosed before the release of the security update.
- The vulnerability can potentially cause a complete denial of service for all applications relying on the affected AD FS instance if account lockout policies are set up.
