The provided content describes a study of vulnerabilities in SOHO routers, and specifically mentions CVE-2013-3092 related to failure to validate HTTP Authorization headers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the failure to validate HTTP Authorization headers in some SOHO routers. This means the routers are not properly checking the authentication information provided in the header, leading to potential unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to validate HTTP Authorization headers
- This lack of validation could allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the router's configuration settings.
- The attacker can intercept and modify network traffic as it enters and leaves the network.
- Complete control of the router at the operating-system level
- Modification of router's settings, rerouting of traffic, or deployment of malicious firmware.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks against all users within the router's domain, allowing sniffing, rerouting of non-SSL protected traffic, DNS poisoning, and denial-of-service attacks.
- Access to local area hosts that would normally be protected by the router's firewall.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector for CVE-2013-3092 is through the HTTP interface of the router, leveraging the fact that it does not properly validate authentication headers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker may need to be on the local network (LAN/WLAN) or have remote access depending on the specific router's configuration and vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's administration interface.
