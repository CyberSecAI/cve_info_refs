Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of objects in memory by Windows USB drivers. This improper handling leads to an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Memory Management:** The core issue is that Windows USB drivers do not handle memory objects correctly, leading to exploitable conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- **System Control:** Attackers can gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full administrative rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the vulnerable system. An attacker can insert a malicious USB device into the system to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access:** An attacker requires physical access to the system to plug in the malicious USB device.
- **No Authentication Required (Default Config):** In a default configuration, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability if they have physical access.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is addressed by correcting the way that a Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.
- Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
- There were no reports of the vulnerability being exploited in the wild when the security bulletin was initially issued.
- The affected systems include various versions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows Server 2012 and Windows RT.
