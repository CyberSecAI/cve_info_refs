  "CVE-2013-3881": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Microsoft",
      "Official Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights."
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) improperly handles objects in memory.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Elevation of privilege"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system."
       ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability."
