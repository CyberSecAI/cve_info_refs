## KnowledgeView Editorial and Management application cross-site scripting vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#521348

Original Release Date: 2013-09-23 | Last Revised: 2013-09-23

---

### Overview

KnowledgeView Editorial and Management application contains a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability ([CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)).

### Description

| [**CWE-79**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**  KnowledgeView Editorial and Management application contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability that can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML content (including script) via the vulnerable query string parameter username. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker can conduct a cross-site scripting attack, which may be used to result in information leakage, privilege escalation, and/or denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
