{
  "vulnerability": {
    "overview": "The vulnerability lies in how the `WinVerifyTrust` function handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable (PE) files. Attackers can modify a signed executable by adding malicious code in unverified portions without invalidating the signature.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the `WinVerifyTrust` function improperly validating the file digest of a specially crafted PE file during Windows Authenticode signature verification.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper validation of the file digest in PE files.",
      "Ability to add malicious code to signed PE files without invalidating the signature.",
      "Lack of strict adherence to the Authenticode specification during signature verification."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Email attacks: sending emails with malicious PE files and convincing users to open them.",
      "Web-based attacks: hosting malicious PE files on websites and convincing users to visit them.",
        "Compromised websites and websites that accept/host user-provided content could also contain the specially crafted PE files."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted PE file, modify a signed PE file, and then either trick a user into executing the file or create a situation in which a program executes it (e.g., hosting on a website)."
