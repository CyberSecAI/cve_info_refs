## Vulnerability in Windows Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2893294)

Published: December 10, 2013 | Updated: July 29, 2014

**Version:** 1.6

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user or application runs or installs a specially crafted, signed portable executable (PE) file on an affected system.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Windows. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the WinVerifyTrust function handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**Why was this bulletin revised on July 29, 2014?**

Previously, this bulletin specified that Microsoft would release, as a default functionality, the stricter Authenticode Signature verification behavior described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2915720](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2915720). However, as we worked with customers to adapt to this change, we determined that the impact to existing software could be high. Therefore, Microsoft no longer plans to enforce the stricter verification behavior as a default requirement. The underlying functionality for stricter verification remains in place, however, and can be enabled at customer discretion. See [Microsoft Security Advisory 2915720](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2915720) for more information.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin, this update includes changes to a default behavior of Windows Authenticode signature verification that will be enabled on an opt-in basis only. Note that this change is not enabled by default with the installation of this update. For more information and instructions on how to enable the change, please see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2915720](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2915720).

**Are Windows 8.1 Preview and Windows Server 2012 R2 Preview affected by any of the vulnerabilities addressed in this bulletin?**

Yes. The 2893294 update is available for Windows 8.1 Preview and Windows Server 2012 R2 Preview. Customers running these operating systems are encouraged to apply the update to their systems. The update is available on [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

**I have applied this update and now my software's digital signature is invalid. What should I do?**

This update causes the WinVerifyTrust function to perform strict Windows Authenticode signature verification for PE files. After applying the update, PE files will be considered "unsigned" if Windows identifies content in them that does not conform to the Authenticode specification. This may impact some installers. If you are using an installer that is impacted, Microsoft recommends using an installer that only extracts content from validated portions of the signed file.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

## WinVerifyTrust Signature Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3900

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the WinVerifyTrust function handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable (PE) files. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by modifying an existing signed executable file to leverage unverified portions of the file in such a way as to add malicious code to the file without invalidating the signature. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3900](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3900).

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the WinVerifyTrust function improperly validates the file digest of a specially crafted PE file while verifying a Windows Authenticode signature.

**What is Windows Authenticode signature verification?**

Windows Authenticode signature verification consists of two primary activities: signature checking on specified objects and trust verification. These activities are carried out by the WinVerifyTrust function, which executes a signature check and then passes the inquiry to a trust provider that supports the action identifier, if one exists. For more technical information regarding the WinVerifyTrust function, see [WinVerifyTrust function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa388208%28vs.85%29.aspx).

For an introduction to Authenticode, see [Introduction to Code Signing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms537361%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

**What is the Windows Authenticode Portable Executable Signature Format?**

Authenticode is a digital signature format used to determine the origin and integrity of software binaries. Authenticode uses Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #7 signed data and X.509 certificates to bind an Authenticode-signed binary to the identity of a software publisher. The term "Authenticode" signature refers to a digital signature format that is generated and verified using the Authenticode Signature Verification Function. For more information on this format, see [Windows Authenticode Portable Executable Signature Format](https://www.microsoft.com/whdc/winlogo/drvsign/authenticode_pe.mspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user or application run or install a specially crafted, signed PE file. An attacker could modify an existing signed file to include malicious code without invalidating the signature. This code would execute in the context of the privilege in which the signed PE file was launched.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user an email message containing the specially crafted PE file and convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted PE file. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could be used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a website that is hosting the specially crafted PE file. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that directs them to the attacker's website.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the WinVerifyTrust function handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable files.

**Note** This update causes the WinVerifyTrust function to perform strict Windows Authenticode signature verification for PE files. After applying the update, PE files will be considered "unsigned" if Windows identifies content in them that does not conform to the Authenticode specification. This may impact some installers. If you are using an installer that is impacted, Microsoft recommends using an installer that only extracts content from validated portions of the signed file.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
