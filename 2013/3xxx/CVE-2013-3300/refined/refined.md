The provided content is related to CVE-2013-3300.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a data bleeding issue in the `lift-json` library. Specifically, the `near` function in `JsonParser.scala` was not correctly calculating the length of the substring it was extracting, which could potentially return data beyond the intended range.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `near` function in `JsonParser.scala` was previously implemented as follows:
```scala
def near = new String(segment, (cur-20) max 0, (cur + 1) min Segments.segmentSize)
```
This implementation had an issue because the third argument to the `String` constructor, which represents the length, was calculated as `(cur + 1) min Segments.segmentSize`, which can be larger than the actual required length, potentially exposing information.

The corrected implementation calculates the length explicitly by calculating the start and end index and computing the difference.
```scala
def near = {
    val start = (cur - 20) max 0
    val len = ((cur + 1) min Segments.segmentSize) - start
    new String(segment, start, len)
  }
```
This ensures that the correct substring length is passed to the `String` constructor.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability could lead to data bleeding, potentially exposing sensitive information or portions of the internal buffer used by the JSON parser when an error occurs. The `near` function is used to provide context when reporting errors, and the incorrect length calculation could result in displaying more than necessary, potentially revealing parts of adjacent data segments that should not be visible. This is clarified by the included test case `Parser does not bleed prior results` which fails without this patch.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could craft a malicious JSON document that triggers a parsing error, specifically where a `near` method call will be executed, potentially leading to the exposure of unintended data. The test case shows this by providing a long JSON string that will error out and trigger this condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to supply a JSON input to the vulnerable parser, ideally crafted to trigger a parsing error where `near` is called to observe the data bleeding. This can be done remotely if the application consumes externally provided JSON data.
