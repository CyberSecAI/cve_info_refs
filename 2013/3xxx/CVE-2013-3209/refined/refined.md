Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3209:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer. This leads to memory corruption, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability.
- Improper access of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content could also be used to host the exploit.
- Social engineering: Attackers would need to convince users to visit the malicious website or open a malicious attachment, typically through a link in an email or instant message.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host a specially crafted website or inject malicious content into a vulnerable website.
- Ability to convince users to interact with the malicious content (e.g., by clicking a link or opening a file).
- No specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, but successful exploitation will give the attacker the same privileges as the victim user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) on various versions of Windows.
- The severity rating is "Critical" for client operating systems and "Moderate" for server operating systems.
- The update (KB2870699) addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
- Several mitigating factors are outlined, such as running Internet Explorer with Enhanced Security Configuration (ESC) on servers and configuring security zones to block ActiveX controls and active scripting.
- Workarounds include setting security levels to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting, or configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting.
