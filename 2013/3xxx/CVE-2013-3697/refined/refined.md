Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1 (NICM.SYS Driver - IOCTL 0x143B6B):**

*   **Root Cause:** A hijack of execution vulnerability exists within the `NICM.SYS` kernel driver when handling the IOCTL code `0x143B6B`.
*   **Weakness:**  Improper handling of the specified IOCTL allows for the hijacking of the execution flow.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel's execution context.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access to the vulnerable system is required.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the driver using the vulnerable IOCTL to trigger the exploit.

**Vulnerability 2 (NWFS.SYS & NCPL.SYS Drivers - IOCTL 0x1439EB & Others):**

*   **Root Cause:** An integer overflow vulnerability is present in the `NWFS.SYS` kernel driver's handling of IOCTL `0x1439EB` and potentially other IOCTLs. This vulnerability is also present in `NCPL.SYS`
*   **Weakness:** The `Alloc_NonPaged_vuln` function calculates the allocation size by adding 0x18 to a user controlled value. When a large user controlled value is supplied this results in an integer overflow allowing an attacker to allocate a small buffer. The allocated buffer is then overflowed in the `rep stosd` operation.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the kernel. This requires a successful kernel pool attack against the underlying operating system.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access to the vulnerable system is required to send the vulnerable IOCTL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send a specific IOCTL with a carefully crafted input size to trigger the integer overflow, and then exploit the pool overflow.

**Summary of Vulnerability Details**
The content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerabilities, including:

*   Affected drivers and versions.
*   Specific IOCTL codes that trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   Assembly code snippets showcasing the vulnerable functions.
*   Explanation of the integer overflow and pool overflow.

**More Details than CVE Description:**
The provided information offers significantly more details than a typical CVE description. It includes the specific driver names (`NICM.SYS`, `NWFS.SYS`, `NCPL.SYS`), vulnerable IOCTL codes (`0x143B6B`, `0x1439EB`), and assembly-level details of the vulnerable functions. This level of detail is not typically found in standard CVE entries. The pastebin content also has a detailed description of the integer overflow vulnerability within the Alloc\_NonPaged\_vuln function, including the exact line of code where the integer overflow occurs, and a subsequent pool overflow, which are not included in the CVE description.

This information provides clear technical insight into the vulnerabilities, allowing for a more thorough understanding of the exploit process.
