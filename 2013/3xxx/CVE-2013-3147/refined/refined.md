Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it involves the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, leading to improper access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: Improper handling of objects in memory can lead to memory corruption. This can be triggered by a specially crafted webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker then needs to convince the user to visit the site. This can be done through techniques like:
    - Email phishing: Embedding a link in an email that redirects to the attacker's site
    - Instant messaging: Sending a link via IM
    - Compromised websites: Injecting malicious content into legitimate sites or ads
- User interaction is required as the user needs to visit the attacker's website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or compromise a legitimate site.
- They must have the ability to persuade users to visit their malicious webpage.
- No specific network position is required beyond the ability to serve malicious content over the web.
