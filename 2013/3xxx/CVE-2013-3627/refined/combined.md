## McAfee Managed Agent contains a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#613886

Original Release Date: 2013-10-04 | Last Revised: 2013-10-04

---

### Overview

McAfee Managed Agent versions 4.5, 4.6, and possibly earlier versions contain a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability ([CWE-400](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)).

### Description

| [**CWE-400**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)**:Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')**  McAfee Managed Agent versions 4.5 and 4.6 contain a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. McAfee Managed Agent runs a service on Windows workstations called "McAfee Framework Service" (FrameworkService.exe) which runs an HTTP server on the default TCP port 8081.By sending a crafted request an attacker can remotely crash the Windows service. This can cause the McAfee software to temporarily stop updating or provide log data until the service is manually restarted. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service against the McAfee Managed Agent software. |
| --- |

### Solution

| McAfee has released a [security bulletin](https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10055) with the details on obtaining the security hotfix for Managed Agent 4.5 Patch 3 and Managed Agent 4.6 Patch 3. McAfee Managed Agent versions 4.8 RTW and later are not affected. If applying the security hotfix is not possible, please consider the following workaround. |

| **Accept connections only from the ePO server**Make sure that the "Accept connections only from the ePO server" option is enabled in the ePO Agent policy. |
