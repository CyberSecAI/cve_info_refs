Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3123:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it arises when Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a flaw in how Internet Explorer handles memory allocation and access, making it susceptible to memory corruption. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the currently logged-in user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could also inject malicious code into compromised websites, or websites that accept/host user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website, typically by getting them to click a link via email or instant message, or by opening a malicious attachment in email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- **Ability to host or inject malicious content:** The attacker must be able to host a malicious website or inject the exploit code into a compromised website.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be capable of convincing a user to visit the attacker controlled webpage.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is one of several memory corruption issues addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-047.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin and patch.
- Microsoft had no reports of exploitation of the vulnerability when the bulletin was released.
- The vulnerability is mitigated to some extent in server environments due to the Enhanced Security Configuration of Internet Explorer by default.
- EMET can help mitigate the exploitation.
