Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3857:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly mentions CVE-2013-3857 as a "Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability" and describes it in the context of Microsoft Office and Web Apps.
*   It is also referenced as part of multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-067 and MS13-072.
*   Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT** to CVE-2013-3857.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from **improper handling of objects in memory** when Microsoft Word parses specially crafted Office files. This memory corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is a memory corruption vulnerability due to inadequate parsing of malformed files. This allows overwriting or manipulation of memory.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** There is a failure to properly sanitize or validate the structure and content of the files being parsed, resulting in exploitable memory corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, an attacker can gain complete control of the system.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can install programs, view, modify, or delete data, and create new user accounts with full rights.
*   **Impact Scope:** Users with fewer privileges are less impacted, but systems where affected Microsoft Office software is used are primarily at risk.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Attachments:** Attackers can send specially crafted Office files as email attachments and trick users into opening them.
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host websites with malicious Office files or inject them into compromised websites. Users are then lured into visiting those sites and opening the malicious files.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, as the user needs to open the malicious file.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince users to open the crafted files, often using social engineering techniques.
*   **No Special System Access:** The attacker does not need special system-level privileges to initiate the exploit. The vulnerability is triggered by the file parsing process itself.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically related to the way Microsoft Word handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files.
*   The memory corruption occurs during file processing, allowing the attacker to gain control of the execution flow.

**Summary:**

CVE-2013-3857 is a critical memory corruption vulnerability that allows remote code execution. It arises from flawed file parsing logic within Microsoft Word. Attackers can exploit this by tricking users into opening malicious documents. The impact includes potential complete system compromise if the user has administrative privileges.
