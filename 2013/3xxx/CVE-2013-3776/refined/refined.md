Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3776:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located within the Oracle Outside In library, which is used for decoding various file types. The root cause is related to how the library processes specifically crafted Hangul Word Processor files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. It arises from the library's inability to handle the malformed Hangul Word Processor file, leading to a process hang.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in the process that is using the Oracle Outside In library to hang, leading to a denial-of-service. The affected system or application becomes unresponsive, disrupting its availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted Hangul Word Processor file to the affected system. This can be done by:
    - Email attachments that are processed by the software using the vulnerable library.
    - Uploading the malicious file through a web interface that relies on Outside In for file processing
- The attacker needs to be able to send or upload the malicious file to a system that uses Oracle Outside In for processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to provide or have the target system process the crafted Hangul Word Processor file.
- The attacker does not need specific privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects various products that utilize the vulnerable Oracle Outside In Technology library, including Oracle Fusion Middleware, IBM WebSphere Portal, Microsoft Exchange Server, etc.

- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely if a user previews a malicious document using Outlook Web App (OWA) in the case of Microsoft Exchange Servers.

- Patches are available from affected vendors like Oracle and Microsoft to address the vulnerability by updating the vulnerable Outside In libraries.
