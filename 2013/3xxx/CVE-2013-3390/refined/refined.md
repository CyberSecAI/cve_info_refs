Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a memory leak in Cisco Prime Central for HCS Assurance. This memory leak can be triggered by a sustained flood against vulnerable TCP ports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory leak: The software does not properly release memory when processing network traffic. This allows attackers to exhaust the server's resources by sending a sustained flood of network packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): The memory leak can lead to the exhaustion of system memory, causing the affected system to become unresponsive and disrupt the monitoring of voice services. A system restart is required to clear the condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: A remote attacker can send a sustained flood of TCP connection to specific vulnerable ports to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability without needing any credentials or access to the system. They only need the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable ports of the affected system.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected product is Cisco Prime Central for HCS Assurance.
- Specific affected versions include 9.1 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is documented under Cisco bug ID CSCub59158.
- There are no available workarounds, and the solution is to upgrade to the recommended release.
- The provided CVSS vector string (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C) indicates that this is a network-based attack, with low complexity, requiring no authentication, resulting in complete availability impact (DoS), and no impact on confidentiality or integrity.
