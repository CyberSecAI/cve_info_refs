Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3737:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a limited session re-use issue within the RT-Extension-MobileUI when using a file-based session store (`Apache::Session::File`) and older versions of non-core authentication extensions (such as `RT::Authen::ExternalAuth` less than version 0.14).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Re-use Vulnerability:** The core issue is that sessions could be re-used in a limited capacity due to how session data was handled in combination with the specific authentication extensions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** The extent of the session re-use is limited. However, it leads to information leaks such as certain user preferences and caches.
*   **Limited Access:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially gain access to cached information such as queue names available for ticket creation, which is sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specific Session Store:** The vulnerability is triggered when using the file-based session storage mechanism (`Apache::Session::File`).
*   **Specific Authentication Extension Versions:**  The vulnerability is also linked to using older versions of specific authentication extensions like `RT::Authen::ExternalAuth` (less than 0.14).
*   **Network access**: Attackers must have network access to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or reuse session data.
*   The attacker must be able to make use of the vulnerable component (RT-Extension-MobileUI)
*   The vulnerable system must be configured with file-based sessions (`Apache::Session::File`) and older, vulnerable versions of specific authentication extensions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the `RT-Extension-MobileUI` and its interaction with particular session storage and authentication mechanisms.
*   The vulnerability is related to but different from the XSS vulnerability described in CVE-2013-3736.
*   The fix is available in `RT-Extension-MobileUI-1.04` which addresses the session re-use vulnerability and the mentioned XSS vulnerability.
