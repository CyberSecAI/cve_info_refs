**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is the improper handling of objects in memory leading to memory corruption. This can be triggered by a specially crafted webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, potentially installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage designed to exploit the memory corruption vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious webpage. This can be done through:
    - Tricking the user into clicking a link in an email or instant message.
    - Utilizing compromised websites or websites that allow user-provided content/ads to host the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a specially crafted webpage.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must be able to convince a user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., by clicking a link).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present across multiple versions of Internet Explorer, including versions 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
- The severity is rated as "Critical" on Windows clients and "Moderate" on Windows servers, highlighting the elevated risk for client systems.
- Microsoft released a security update (MS13-047) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released.
- The exploitability index in the June bulletin summary should be consulted for information regarding the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days of the release.
- Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate attacks that attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities.
-  Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Servers by default mitigates this vulnerability unless the website is in the trusted sites list
