Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3555:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the GTPv2 dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A malformed GTPv2 packet can trigger a crash in the dissector. This is likely due to a parsing error or an unexpected data structure in the packet that is not properly handled by the software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a crash of the Wireshark application. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, preventing the user from analyzing network traffic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack can be carried out by injecting a specially crafted, malformed GTPv2 packet onto the network.
- Alternatively, the attack can be delivered by tricking a user into opening a malicious packet capture file containing the crafted GTPv2 packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to either inject network packets or have a user open a malicious packet capture file with Wireshark.
- No specific user level privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability, as it occurs during packet dissection process within the application.
- An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position or a local network with direct access is able to inject a malformed packet.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is referenced as "wnpa-sec-2013-24".
- Affected versions of Wireshark are from 1.8.0 to 1.8.6.
- The issue is resolved in Wireshark version 1.8.7 and later.
