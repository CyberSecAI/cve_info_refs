The provided content describes two vulnerabilities found in Zabbix: a CGI Generic Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and a CGI Generic SQL Injection vulnerability.

**CGI Generic Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `report6.php` CGI script fails to adequately sanitize request strings, specifically the `items[0][itemid]` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can include a remote file from a remote server and execute arbitrary commands on the target host.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes a remote file path in the `items[0][itemid]` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `report6.php` script. No authentication is needed.

**CGI Generic SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `report6.php` CGI script does not properly escape arguments in SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, vulnerable SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially bypass authentication, read confidential data, modify the database, or gain control of the remote operating system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By injecting malicious SQL code into various parameters of the `report6.php` script such as `items[0][itemid]` and `items[0][description]`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `report6.php` script. No authentication is needed.
