Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the ticket watch mechanism within OTRS (Open Ticket Request System). Specifically, the issue lies in how URLs are handled within this mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** The core weakness is the ability for a user to manipulate URLs related to ticket watching. This manipulation allows the user to bypass access controls.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The system does not properly enforce access permissions for tickets when the ticket watch mechanism is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Ticket Access:** An attacker with a valid agent login can gain access to ticket contents they are not authorized to view. This represents a breach of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting specific URLs in the ticket watch mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Agent Login:** The attacker needs to have a valid agent account on the affected OTRS system. This means that the attacker is a legitimate user of the system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content indicates that both CVE-2013-3551 and CVE-2013-4088 are addressed by the same fix, suggesting that they stem from the same root cause or closely related issues.
*   The fix involves updating the OTRS package to version 3.2.8-1.mga2 and 3.2.8-1.mga3 for Mageia releases 2 and 3, respectively.
