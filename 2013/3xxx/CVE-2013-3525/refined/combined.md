# [On our security policies](/blog/2013/04/on-our-security-policies)

[April 17, 2013](/blog/2013/04/on-our-security-policies)

We take software security very seriously at Best Practical. Weregularly conduct audits of our own code and make security releases
(including patches for all supported previous versions) for the
vulnerabilties that we find. We want to ensure that the software we
produce — which is often used to track security incidents — is not
itself the cause of any.

We thus wish to make clear that the recent claim of a SQL
injection vulnerability (since retracted) in RT is incorrect. We were notified via
email on the 10th, and immediately examined the report. Within a few
hours we had verified that the claimed exploit did not function
according to the author's claims, and replied to the reporter
accordingly, asking for further information.

Best Practical believes in *responsible disclosure*; namely, that
vulnerabilities should be reported to the vendor privately, and then a
timeline should be jointly established upon which the vulnerability will
be made public. This allows sufficient time to examine the problem,
come to a minimally-invasive solution which addresses the root cause,
and prepare patches for all relevant supported versions of RT — while
balancing this against the threat that the vulnerability is already
being exploited in the wild. Past security researchers who have
reported potential vulnerabilities have been excellent about discussing
timeframes for public release of the weaknesses they have found.

Unfortunately, the author of the above report did not wait for a
response from us before publishing his mistaken findings. Publishing
unverified vulnerabilities can easily cause unnecessary CVEs (CVE-2013-3525 was assigned to this one) and
confusion for vendors and users of the software. In this case, the
Debian security team, who we've worked with in the past, picked up the
report and contacted us to verify it. At that point in time, we decided
to publish this notice.

If you ever believe you have found a vulnerability in our software,
please report it to [security@bestpractical.com](security%40bestpractical.com) so we can work together to verify it and
resolve it in a timely manner. We also appreciate if you provide a PGP
public key, so we can encrypt any security-sensitive communication.
This information is, as always, available from [bestpractical.com/security/](http://bestpractical.com/security/)
