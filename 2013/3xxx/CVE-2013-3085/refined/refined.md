The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Belkin F5D8236-4 v2 router, and it **does not** relate to CVE-2013-3085 which is an authentication bypass.

Specifically, this document details the following:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The Belkin F5D8236-4 v2 router's web interface does not implement CSRF protection for its HTML forms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Lack of unpredictable tokens in HTTP requests.
*   Lack of HTTP referrer checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can gain full control of the victim's router by tricking an authenticated administrator into performing actions on the router through a malicious webpage.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious webpage containing HTML forms that target the router's web interface.
*   The victim (a logged in administrator) is lured into visiting this malicious page.
*   The victim's browser automatically submits the attacker-controlled forms to the router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick an already authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious web page.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

The document provides a proof-of-concept demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability to enable remote management of the router.
The provided content explicitly states that this issue is related to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and explicitly lists CVE-2013-3085 as related to "Authentication Bypass" which this document does not address.
