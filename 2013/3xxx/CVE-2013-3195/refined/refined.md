Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2013-3195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `DSA_InsertItem` function within the Windows common control library (`Comctl32.dll`). This improper memory allocation for data structures leads to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory allocation within the `DSA_InsertItem` function.
- Integer overflow when handling data structures in `Comctl32.dll`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- Complete control of the affected system: If successfully exploited, an attacker can gain full control over the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specially crafted web request sent to an ASP.NET web application: The vulnerability can be triggered through a specially crafted web request targeted at a vulnerable ASP.NET web application using the `DSA_InsertItem` function.
- The `DSA_InsertItem` function takes an arbitrary user value which is the root cause of the problem.
- Exploitation is possible through either authenticated or anonymous users who have network access to the vulnerable target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send specially crafted web requests to an ASP.NET web application running on an affected system.
- The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- No authentication is required, depending on the web application setup.

**Affected Systems:**
- 64-bit editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012.
- Note: The vulnerability has a "No severity rating" for 32-bit versions of these systems and for Windows RT, as the attack vectors are blocked by default. Microsoft still recommends applying the update as a defense-in-depth measure.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploitability index for this vulnerability was rated as "Critical" for affected systems.
- The vulnerability was privately reported and not publicly disclosed prior to the security bulletin release.
- Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the bulletin's release.
- The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows common control library allocates memory for data structures.
