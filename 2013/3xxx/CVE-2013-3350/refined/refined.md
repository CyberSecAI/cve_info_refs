      "vulnerability": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to invoke public methods on ColdFusion Components (CFC) using WebSockets.",
      "root_cause": "The `cfwebsocket` tag in Adobe ColdFusion 10 allows the creation of a javascript object that can call the `invoke()` method. This method can be used to invoke any public method on any CFC from JavaScript.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure implementation of web socket functionality.",
        "Lack of proper access controls for CFC methods when invoked through WebSockets."

      "impact": "An attacker could invoke public methods in any CFC, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification, or denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "Attackers can leverage a websocket connection and the `invoke` function to call public CFC methods",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a websocket connection to the server and send messages to it. No authentication is required to exploit this issue before the patch."

    {
     "vulnerability": "CFC metadata caching issue",
      "root_cause": "CFC metadata is cached for one minute since the last websocket invoke. If the access level is updated in the CFC, changes aren't effective for 1 minute.",
      "weaknesses":[ "CFC metadata caching mechanism that doesn't reflect immediate changes to CFC configuration."],
      "impact": "During the 1 minute, the attacker might still have access to methods that are not supposed to be publicly accessible or could exploit the cached metadata.",
       "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit cached metadata for one minute by quickly initiating calls through websockets." ,
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a websocket connection to the server, send messages to it, and know the caching behavior."
