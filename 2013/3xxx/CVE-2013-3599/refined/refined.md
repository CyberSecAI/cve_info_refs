{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application returns the user role as a parameter in the response to the userlogin.jsp request, which is then passed to the client for processing.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter. The user role, intended to be an immutable server-side property, is exposed as a parameter which can be manipulated by the client.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation is possible without authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "Manipulating the user role parameter passed back in the userlogin.jsp response.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can manipulate the user role parameter without needing prior authentication."
