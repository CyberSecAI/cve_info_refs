Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-3136:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel's improper handling of objects in memory during certain page fault system calls. Specifically, the kernel doesn't properly handle these calls, which leads to information disclosure.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
-   Improper handling of page fault system calls by the Windows kernel.
-   The kernel fails to properly manage memory objects during certain operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker can potentially disclose sensitive information from kernel memory.
-   The vulnerability can be used to obtain information that might be helpful to further compromise an affected system.
-   It does not directly allow code execution or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   An attacker needs to log on to the local system.
-   The attacker must execute a specially crafted application, or convince a logged-in user to run it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker must have valid logon credentials.
-   The attacker needs the ability to log on locally to the targeted system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects 32-bit versions of Windows XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows 8.
- The vulnerability was not publicly known until it was reported to Microsoft through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
- No active exploitation of this vulnerability was reported to Microsoft before the release of the security bulletin.
- The fix involves correcting how the Windows kernel manages specific page fault system calls.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Microsoft.
- There are no workarounds for this issue; users should apply the security update.
- The vulnerability was reported by Mateusz "j00ru" Jurczyk of Google Inc.
