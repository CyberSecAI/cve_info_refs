[![](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/wctf_logo-300x90.png)](http://ctf.360.cn/en/index.html)During the weekend of 6-8th of July, our CTF team – [Dragon Sector](http://dragonsector.pl) – played in an invite-only competition called [WCTF](http://ctf.360.cn/en/index.html), held in Beijing. The other [participants](http://ctf.360.cn/en/index.html#corps) were top-tier groups from around the world (e.g. Shellphish, ESPR, LC↯BC or Tokyo Westerns), and the prize pool of the contest was a stunning $100,000 USD. One particularly unique rule of the CTF was that the challenges were prepared by the teams themselves and not the organizers. Each of the 10 teams was obligated to provide two tasks, at least one of which had to run on Windows. This meant that each team could capture a maximum of 18 flags set up by the other teams in the room. In practice, the structure of the contest incentivized submitting extremely difficult and complex challenges. Remote help was allowed, and the scoring system offered *first blood* bonus points for being the first, second and third team to solve a task. The hacking part of the event was followed by a soft part, where additional points were granted by a jury and the participants for presenting one’s own tasks on stage.

After two days of though competition, we came out as the runner up of the CTF with 6/18 tasks solved, behind the winner – Tokyo Westerns (7/18 tasks):

## [Wrapping up the kernel infoleak research with a whitepaper](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/2018/07/wrapping-up-the-kernel-infoleak-research/)

![](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kernelbleed-300x76.png "Kernelbleed")Following the [previous post](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/2017/06/announcing-bochspwn-reloaded-and-my-recon-montreal-2017-slides/) in June last year, I continued to actively work on Bochspwn Reloaded, a [Bochs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/)-based tool designed to detect leaks of uninitialized memory from kernels to the user address space. In addition to my talk at REcon Montreal 2017 ([slides](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/slides/2017/recon.pdf), [video](https://recon.cx/media-archive/2017/mtl/recon2017-mtl-03-j00ru-Bochspwn-Reloaded-Detecting-Kernel-Memory-Disclosure-with-x86-Emulation-and-Taint-Tracking.mp4)), I also gave similar presentations at Black Hat USA 2017 ([slides](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/slides/2017/bhusa.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tqo78E04cM)) and a Polish event called *Security PWNing Conference* held in Warsaw ([slides](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/slides/2017/pwning.pdf) in Polish).

Since then, I improved and polished various parts of the instrumentation and testing environment, which led to new waves of Windows bugs being reported to Microsoft in several iterations throughout the year. The most significant advancements I made during this time are as follows:

* Implemented support for x64 guest systems and used it to identify 17 new Windows bugs specific to the 64-bit platform.
* Developed and evaluated a taint-less method of detecting leaks to mass storage devices, which helped find a number of bugs in the Windows NTFS.sys file system driver.
* Implemented a test suite of programs to automatically test the `NtQuery` system call family on Windows, which uncovered new issues in a total of 14 syscalls across 23 different information classes.
* Tested other types of instrumentation aimed to detect problems related to user↔kernel communication, such as kernel address disclosures through *double-writes*.

![](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/recon2017-300x126.png)A few days ago at the [REcon conference](https://recon.cx/2017/montreal/) in Montreal, I gave [a talk](https://recon.cx/2017/montreal/talks/bochspwn.html) titled *Bochspwn Reloaded**: Detecting Kernel Memory Disclosure with x86 Emulation and Taint Tracking*. During the presentation, I introduced and thoroughly explained the core concept, inner workings and results of my latest research project: a custom full-system instrumentation based on the Bochs x86 emulator, designed to detect instances of uninitialized kernel memory disclosure to user-mode applications. This work was largely based on the original Bochspwn research, conducted by [Gynvael](http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/) and me in 2013, whose goal was to identify so-called *double fetch* conditions in the kernels of various popular operating systems (see [SyScan slides and whitepaper](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/2013/05/syscan-2013-bochspwn-paper-and-slides/), [Black Hat slides](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/2013/08/black-hat-usa-2013-bochspwn-slides-and-pointers/) and [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/j00ru/kfetch-toolkit)). Bochspwn Reloaded repeated the success of its predecessor, so far having found nearly 30 infoleak vulnerabilities in Windows, and more than a dozen lesser issues in Linux.

The most relevant part of the abstract is as follows:

*This presentation will introduce another subtle class of kernel vulnerabilities – disclosure of uninitialized stack and heap memory to user-mode applications. Since information leaks of this kind leave hardly any footprint, they are rarely noticed and reported to system vendors. However, we have found that it is still a prevalent problem in current kernels (especially Windows), and can be abused to defeat certain exploit mitigations or steal sensitive data residing in ring-0. In order to address this matter, we have developed a new Bochspwn-style instrumentation based on rudimentary kernel memory taint tracking, which we then used to discover 30 memory disclosure issues in Windows alone. In this talk, we will discuss the kernel design problems behind the bugs, the design of our tool, and the exploitation process of some of the most interesting findings.*

## [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #5: win32k!NtGdiGetDIBitsInternal (Windows 7-10)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/2017/04/windows-kernel-local-denial-of-service-5/)

Today I’ll discuss yet another way to bring the Windows operating system down from the context of an unprivileged user, in a 5th and final post in the series. It hardly means that this is the last way to crash the kernel or even the last way that I’m aware of, but covering these bugs indefinitely could soon become boring and quite repetitive, so I’ll stop here and return with other interesting material in the near future. Links to the previous posts about Windows DoS issues are listed below:

* [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #4: nt!NtAccessCheck and family (Windows 8-10)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3225)
* [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #3: nt!NtDuplicateToken (Windows 7-8)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3187)
* [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #2: win32k!NtDCompositionBeginFrame (Windows 8-10)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3151)
* [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #1: win32k!NtUserThunkedMenuItemInfo (Windows 7-10)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3101)

The bug explained today can be found in the `win32k!NtGdiGetDIBitsInternal` system call, which has been around since the very early days of Windows existence (at least Windows NT). The syscall is used by the [GetDIBits](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd144879%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx), [BitBlt](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd183370%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) and [StretchBlt](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145120%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) documented API functions, and has been recently subject to patching in Microsoft’s April Patch Tuesday, in order to fix an unrelated double-fetch vulnerability reported by Project Zero (CVE-2017-0058, [issue #1078](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1078) in the tracker). The DoS problem was also reported to the vendor at that time, but due to its low severity, it didn’t meet the bar for a security bulletin.

After a short break, we’re back with another local Windows kernel DoS. As a quick reminder, this is the fourth post in the series, and links to the previous ones can be found below:

* [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #3: nt!NtDuplicateToken (Windows 7-8)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3187)
* [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #2: win32k!NtDCompositionBeginFrame (Windows 8-10)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3151)
* [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #1: win32k!NtUserThunkedMenuItemInfo (Windows 7-10)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3101)

The bug we’re discussing today resides in an internal `nt!SeAccessCheckByType` function, reachable via three system calls: `NtAccessCheck`, `NtAccessCheckByType` and `NtAccessCheckByTypeResultList`. All Windows versions starting with Windows 8 are affected, which is caused by the fact that the relevant code area is specific to so-called *lowbox tokens* (used by AppContainers), a mechanism that was only introduced in Windows 8. Similarly to the past issues, this one was also discovered by a Bochspwn-like instrumentation, and is caused by an unsafe access to user-mode memory (not guarded by adequate exception handling).

## [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #3: nt!NtDuplicateToken (Windows 7-8)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/2017/03/windows-kernel-local-denial-of-service-3/)

June 22, 2021March 7, 2017 by [j00ru](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/author/j00ru/ "View all posts by j00ru")

This is the third post in a series about unpatched local Windows Kernel Denial-of-Service bugs. The list of previous posts published so far is as follows:

* [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #2: win32k!NtDCompositionBeginFrame (Windows 8-10)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3151)
* [Windows Kernel Local Denial-of-Service #1: win32k!NtUserThunkedMenuItemInfo (Windows 7-10)](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3101)

As opposed to the two issues discussed before, today’s bug is not in the graphical subsystem (win32k.sys), but in the core kernel module: ntoskrnl.exe, and more specifically in the handler of the `nt!NtDuplicateToken` system call (under the same name). An equivalent bug can also be found in the `nt!NtCreateToken` system call, but since it requires the SeCreateTokenPrivilege privilege, it cannot be triggered by a regular user, and hence is not of much interest to us.

According to [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff566446%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx), the definition of the syscall is as follows:

June 22, 2021February 27, 2017 by [j00ru](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/author/j00ru/ "View all posts by j00ru")

Another week, another way to locally crash the Windows kernel with an unhandled exception in ring-0 code (if you haven’t yet, see last week’s [DoS in win32k!NtUserThunkedMenuItemInfo](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=3101)). Today, the bug is in the `win32k!NtDCompositionBeginFrame` system call handler, whose beginning can be translated into the following C-like pseudo-code:

```
NTSTATUS STDCALL NtDCompositionBeginFrame(HANDLE hDirComp, PINPUT_STRUCTURE lpInput, POUTPUT_STRUCTURE lpOutput) {
  NTSTATUS st;
  INPUT_STRUCTURE Input;
  DirectComposition::CConnection *Connection;

  if (lpInput != NULL) {
    try {
      ProbeForRead(lpInput, sizeof(INPUT_STRUCTURE), 1);
      RtlCopyMemory(&Input, lpInput, sizeof(INPUT_STRUCTURE));
      st = STATUS_SUCCCESS;
    } __except(EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER) {
      st = GetExceptionCode();
    }
  } else {
    st = STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER;
  }

  KeEnterCriticalRegion();
  if (NT_SUCCESS(st)) {
    st = DirectComposition::CConnection::ReferenceHandle(hDirComp, &Connection);
    if (NT_SUCCESS(st)) {
      if (Microsoft_Windows_Win32kEnableBits & 1) {
        Template_xq(&DCompBeginFrameEvent, hDirComp, lpInput->SomeField);
      }
      [...]
    }
  }

  [...]
}
```

Since the i/o structure names and definitions are not known to me, I just generically called them `INPUT_STRUCTURE` and `OUTPUT_STRUCTURE`; their details are non-essential to understand the bug. Here, we can see that the 2nd argument (`lpInput`) is accessed twice: once in line 9, with a proper sanitization with an inlined `ProbeForRead` call and a try/except block, but then also in line 23, where a field at offset 0x10 (`SomeField` in the above listing) is read from the user pointer while exception handling is disabled. The `Template_xq` function is just a thin wrapper around [EtwWrite](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff545627%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396), which is used for logging kernel-mode events. This is the bug we want to exploit.

June 22, 2021February 22, 2017 by [j00ru](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/author/j00ru/ "View all posts by j00ru")

Back in 2013, [Gynvael](http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/) and I published the results of our research into discovering so-called *double fetch* vulnerabilities in operating system kernels, by running them in full software emulation mode inside of an IA-32 emulator called [Bochs](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/). The purpose of the emulation (and our custom embedded instrumentation) was to capture detailed information about accesses to user-mode memory originating from the kernel, so that we could later run analysis tools to discover multiple references to single memory addresses within the scope of one system call, and produce meaningful reports. The project was called Bochspwn [[1]](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=1695)[[2]](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=1880)[[3]](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/?p=2084) (or [kfetch-toolkit](https://github.com/j00ru/kfetch-toolkit) on Github) and was largely successful, leading to the discovery of several dozen serious vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel. We believe it also played a significant role in popularizing the double-fetch vulnerability class and the concept of using system-wide instrumentation for security, as several other fruitful projects ensued as a result, probably most notable of which is [Xenpwn](https://github.com/felixwilhelm/xenpwn).

After all this time, I decided to get back on the subject of full system instrumentation and analyzing various execution traces in search of indicators of potential vulnerabilities. Specifically, one of my goals was to develop more patterns (based on memory accesses or other events) which could signal problems in kernel-mode code other than just double fetches. One intuitive example of such pattern is the lack of exception handling being set up at the time of accessing ring-3 memory area. As the documentation of the Windows [ProbeForRead](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559876%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) function states:

*Drivers must call ProbeForRead inside a try/except block. If the routine raises an exception, the driver should complete the IRP with the appropriate error. **Note that subsequent accesses by the driver to the user-mode buffer must also be encapsulated within a try/except block**: a malicious application could have another thread deleting, substituting, or changing the protection of user address ranges at any time (even after or during a call to ProbeForRead or ProbeForWrite).*

## [Slides about my Windows Metafile research and fuzzing now public](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/2016/11/slides-about-my-windows-metafile-research-and-fuzzing-now-public/)

June 22, 2021November 15, 2016 by [j00ru](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/author/j00ru/ "View all posts by j00ru")

![](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ruxcon.png)![](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pacsec.png)During the past few weeks, I travelled around the world to give talks at several great security conferences, such as [Ruxcon](https://ruxcon.org.au/) (Melbourne, Australia), [PacSec](https://pacsec.jp/) (Tokyo, Japan), [Black Hat Europe](http://blackhat.com/eu-16/) (London, UK) and finally [Security PWNing Conference](https://www.instytutpwn.pl/konferencja/pwning2016/) (Warsaw, Poland). At a majority of the events, I presented the results of my Windows Metafile security research, which took place earlier this year and yielded vulnerabilities in GDI (exploitable e.g. in Internet Explorer), GDI+ (e.g. Microsoft Office), ATMFD.DLL (Windows local privilege escalation) and the *Virtual Printers* mechanism in VMware Workstation. As part of the talks, I explained what GDI and metafiles really are, the process I followed while hunting for and identifying the vulnerabilities, and the exploitation paths for some of them. Finally, I discussed my approach to fuzzing a user-mode Windows DLL module on Linux machines (cross-platform), on the example of a 3rd party JPEG2000 decoder used in VMware products. Since my allocated time slots at both Ruxcon and PacSec were too short to cover the entirety of the material, I talked about the ATMFD.DLL vulnerabilities exclusively at Ruxcon, and about GDI+ only at PacSec. A complete list of the EMF bugs that were mentioned in the presentations can be found in the [Google Project Zero tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/list?can=1&q=emf+finder%3Amjurczyk).

![](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/blackhat.jpg)The second talk (presented at BH) focused purely on fuzzing and the various thoughts, techniques and results I arrived at after actively using this approach to uncover software security flaws for more than 5 years, both as part of and outside of work. The topics included gathering initial corpora of input files, extracting code coverage information from running programs, using this information to “distill” and manage live corpora (using a parallelized algorithm), interacting with our target application on various levels, and effectively mutating the input data to accomplish the best results. The presentation was then concluded with a brief analysis of my recent Windows kernel font fuzzing initiative, which has resulted in the discovery of [18 issues](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/list?can=1&q=id%3A368%2C369%2C370%2C382%2C383%2C384%2C385%2C386%2C392%2C401%2C402%2C506%2C507%2C682%2C683%2C684%2C864%2C868) so far.

![](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/syscalls.png)Those of you interested in the Windows kernel-mode internals are probably familiar with the syscall tables I maintain on my blog: the 32-bit and 64-bit listings of Windows system calls with their respective IDs in all major versions of the OS, available here (and are also linked to in the menu):

* Windows Core System Calls: [32-bit](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/nt/32/) and [64-bit](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/nt/64/).
* Windows Graphical System Calls: [32-bit](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/win32k/32/) and [64-bit](https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/win32k/64/).

After a few years of inactivity in this area, I’ve found some time to update and thoroughly refresh the tables. The changelog is as follows:

1. Added information from Windows Server 2003 (R2, R2 SP2), Windows Server 2008 (R2, R2 SP1), Windows Server 2012 (R2) and Windows 10 (1507, 1511, 1607).
2. Clarified some versions of Windows, resulting in removing non-existent Windows Server 2008 SP1 (32-bit), Windows XP SP0 (64-bit), Windows Server 2003 SP1 (64-bit), Windows Server 2008 SP1 (64-bit).
3. Removed empty columns with missing information from the win32k 32-bit table.
4. Performed a major clean up of the lists, resolving all syscall handler collisions and renaming invalid symbols (e.g. “FsRtlSyncVolumes”) stemming from compiler optimizations to their correct form. From now on, all system calls are represented by their real names starting with “Nt”.
5. Unified the layout of NT and win32k tables.
6. Added more granular information to the win32k 64-bit table (accounting for all service packs and major releases).
7. Fixed HTML syntax errors and improved JavaScript code formatting.

I hope the tables keep proving useful for Windows researchers interested in those interfaces. :-) And of course, all comments, suggestions and bug reports are highly appreciated!

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-048 - Important

## Vulnerability in Windows Kernel Could Allow Information Disclosure (2839229)

Published: June 11, 2013 | Updated: June 18, 2013

**Version:** 1.2

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Windows. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if an attacker logs on to a system and runs a specially crafted application or convinces a local, logged-in user to run a specially crafted application. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise an affected system.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows kernel handles certain page fault system calls. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3136](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3136).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability or convince a locally authenticated user to execute a specially crafted application.

#### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel fails to properly handle certain page fault system calls.

**What is the Windows kernel?**

The Windows kernel is the core of the operating system. It provides system-level services such as device management and memory management, allocates processor time to processes, and manages error handling.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could disclose information from kernel memory on the local system. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

For an attacker to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to execute a specially crafted application. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted application to a user and convincing them to run it.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way Windows handles certain page fault system calls.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
