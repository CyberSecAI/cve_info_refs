Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3527:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of `$_POST` arrays in Vanilla Forums. Specifically, user-supplied input within the `Form/Email` and other form fields are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This is due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL statements.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary User Insertion:** Attackers can insert arbitrary user accounts into the database, potentially granting them administrative privileges if the attacker creates an account with admin rights. This can lead to complete control of the forum by the attacker.
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, by dumping the `gdn_user` table to a file using the `INTO OUTFILE` SQL command.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The SQL injection vulnerability can be used to modify or delete data within the database as well.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attacks are conducted via crafted HTTP POST requests to the `entry/signin` and `entry/passwordrequest` endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication, making it easily accessible to any attacker.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Additional details:**

*   The exploit examples show how to insert a user and dump the user table using SQL injection in the email field by manipulating the `Form/Email` parameter.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Michael Schratt.
*   The vulnerable version is up to `vanilla-core-2-0-18-4`.
*   A patch was released in version `2.0.18.8`, which includes a fix that disables the ability to call functions in escaped SQL strings by throwing an exception if `EscapeValueSql` is set.
*   The fix involves changes to `class.sqldriver.php`, specifically throwing an exception to prevent the execution of function calls within escaped SQL strings.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its cause, how it can be exploited, and the steps that were taken to remediate it.
