Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3713:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that during system installation using Live Media, the user "root" was incorrectly added to the "users" group. This resulted in the `/etc/shadow` file being readable by members of the "users" group.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Group Membership:** The primary weakness is the inappropriate inclusion of the "root" user in the "users" group.
*   **Insecure File Permissions:** This incorrect group membership led to the `/etc/shadow` file, which contains sensitive user password hash information, being readable by a wider range of users than intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By reading `/etc/shadow`, a local attacker could gain access to password hashes for all users on the system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** With the password hashes, attackers could potentially crack the passwords and gain unauthorized access to user accounts, including root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability. They must be a member of the "users" group or any user who has read access to the `/etc/shadow` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the affected system.
*   **Group Membership:** The attacker needs to be a member of the "users" group to exploit the vulnerability if the file permissions are set in a standard way (readable by group users)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in openSUSE 13.1 systems installed using Live Media.
*   The fix involved removing the "root" user from the "users" group and ensuring the correct permissions for /etc/shadow.
*   The provided information gives more details than the basic CVE description which only mentions a "permissions issue".
