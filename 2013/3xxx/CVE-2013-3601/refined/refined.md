Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3601:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Coursemill Learning Management System (version 6.6) relies on JavaServer Pages (JSP) for user-executed functions. These functions use an "op" parameter to determine which operation to execute.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CWE-250):** The application allows non-administrative users (e.g., students) to execute operations that should be restricted to administrators. The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on the JSP functions based on the user's role.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with a non-administrative user account can execute privileged functions, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or administrative control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves manipulating the "op" parameter in the JSP calls to execute administrative functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs a valid user account with non-administrative privileges within the Coursemill application.
*   The attacker also needs to be able to manipulate the "op" parameter in the HTTP request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Coursemill version 6.6, and is reported to be remediated in version 6.8.
*   The content provides more detail than the generic CVE description.
