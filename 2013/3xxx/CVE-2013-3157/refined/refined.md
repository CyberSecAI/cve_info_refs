Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3157:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Access handles memory when parsing specially crafted Access files. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from memory corruption within Microsoft Access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Access when opening specially crafted Access files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
