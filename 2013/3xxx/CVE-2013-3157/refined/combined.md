## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Access Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2848637)

Published: September 10, 2013 | Updated: September 13, 2013

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Access file with an affected version of Microsoft Access. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft Access 2007, Microsoft Access 2010, and Microsoft Access 2013. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Access parses and validates data when opening specially crafted Access files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

## Multiple Access Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist in the way that Microsoft Access parses content in Access files. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view these vulnerabilities as standard entries in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see the following:

| Vulnerability title | CVE number |
| --- | --- |
| Access Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2013-3155](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3155) |
| Access File Format Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2013-3156](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3156) |
| Access Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2013-3157](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3157) |

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Do not open** **Office** **files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources**

  Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?**

These are remote code execution vulnerabilities.

**What causes the vulnerabilities?**

The vulnerabilities exist in the way that Microsoft Access handles memory when opening specially crafted Access files.

**What might an attacker** **use the vulnerabilities** **to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How** **could** **an attacker exploit the vulnerabilities?**

These vulnerabilities require that a user open a specially crafted Access file with an affected version of Microsoft Access.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities by sending a specially crafted Access file to the user and then convincing the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a specially crafted Access file that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Access file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Systems where Microsoft Access is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Access validates data when opening specially crafted Access files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had** **these vulnerabilities** **been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about the vulnerabilities through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that these** **vulnerabilitieswere** **being** **exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that the vulnerabilities had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
