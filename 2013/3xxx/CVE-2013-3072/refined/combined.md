# Taking over the Netgear WNDR4700

[[return to summary]](../../../casestudies/exploiting-soho-routers/#summary)

* The WNDR4700 can be trivially taken over by any adversary on the LAN or WLAN.
* If remote management is enabled, the WNDR4700 can be trivially taken over by a remote adversary.

## Description

The Netgear WNDR4700 router is susceptible to an authentication bypass attack. Without providing credentials, an attacker on the LAN can access a specific page on this router's embedded web server that permanently breaks authentication on the device (until factory reset). Once this attack is performed, *anyone* on the local network can access the router's administration interface without providing a username or password. This same attack is possible from the WAN if remote management has been enabled. Administrators should disable remote management immediately.

By default remote management of the WNDR4700 is not enabled, but remote take over of the WNDR4700 may still be possible (though was not confirmed). The firmware on the WNDR4700 takes countermeasures to protect against cross-site request forgery in the form of anti-forgery tokens. In [another Netgear router we evaluated](netgear_wnr3500.html), we found that the CSRF tokens were poorly chosen, and could be guessed easily by a remote adversary. We did not investigate what algorithm is used to generate tokens on the WNDR4700, but the inability to perform cross-site request forgery prevents this authentication bypass from escalating to a full, remote compromise without an alternative attack method.

## Local Attack Requirements

* An attacker must have access to a machine on the local network, either by physically connecting, or by compromising a machine on the local network through other means (e.g., via malware).

## Remote Attack Requirements

* Remote management must be enabled on the WNDR4700.

## Details

The full attack is performed by simply accessing the page:

`http://[router_ip]/BRS_03B_haveBackupFile_fileRestore.html`

where `[router_ip]` is the IP address of the router. After accessing this page, the WNDR4700 no longer requires a username or password to access the administrative interface. This persists even when the router is power cycled, and can only be remedied by a reset to factory default settings.

The Netgear telnetenable utility is another method to gain access to the router, but is not necessary for this attack.

* Vulnerable Firmware is V1.0.0.34.
* Other versions of the firmware were not tested.

## Impact

A successful attack exploiting this vulnerability can give a local adversary full control of the victim router.

## Recommendations to the vendor

* Ideally, a router should never disable authentication, even temporarily.
* If this must be possible, functionality that disables authentication on a router should never be accessible to an unauthenticated user.
* Any measures that disable authentication should be purely temporary and should not persist through a device reboot.

## Recommendations to device administrators

* (4/13/2013) There is not currently an available firmware upgrade that remedies this vulnerability.
* Take additional preventative measures and precautions by following the steps outlined on our summary page [here](../../../casestudies/exploiting-soho-routers/#recommendationsAdmin).

Was this article helpful?

 Yes

 No

**Note: Please remember to do factory default after firmware upgrade. Enter "Backup Settings" in the web GUI and click "Erase" button of "Revert to factory default settings".**

**New Features, Bug Fixes & Enhancements:**

* Open the DFS channel for CE (Europe), C-tick (Australia) and IC (Canada).
* Fixed six security CVE issues. (CVE-2013-3069, CVE-2013-3070, CVE-2013-3071, CVE-2013-3072, CVE-2013-3073, CVE-2013-3074).

**Known issues & bugs:**

* With regards to Apple's Time Machine backup function, WNDR4700 only supports EXT4, EXT3 , EXT2, HFS+ in Journal, HFS+ in non-journal file system. WNDR4700 does not support NTFS, FAT16, FAT32 file format for Apple Time machine backup at the moment.

**To Install:**

**Note:** To avoid wireless disconnect issue during the firmware download process, NETGEAR recommends that firmware upgrade be performed on a computer with wired connection.

1. Write down all the settings which you changed from the default values, since you may need to re-enter them manually.
2. Download the firmware and save it to a convenient place such as your desktop. Unzip if needed.
3. Log in to the router using a Web browser. The URL is **http://www.routerlogin.net**.
4. Click ADVANCED tab > Administration > Firmware Upgrade.
5. Click **Browse** and find the file you just downloaded.
6. Click **Upload**. Do not interrupt the upgrade while the router does this step.

**Important Note:**

1. The upgrade process is completed when the on screen progress bar completes. If power LED light turns amber and blinking, power cycle the router to complete the upgrade.
2. If the upgrade progress bar on web GUI doesn’t display correctly during firmware upgrade, you can still check the status using Power LED. The Power LED should be blinking (amber) during firmware upgrade.  After firmware upgrade is done and boots up the system, it changes to steady amber color.

   Please DO NOT power off or reboot the device during firmware upgrade, otherwise, it  may result to a corrupt firmware and cause the device not to work.

# Exploiting SOHO Routers

August 12, 2013

ISE researchers discovered critical security vulnerabilities in numerous small
office/home office (SOHO) routers and wireless access points. These vulnerabilities
allow a remote attacker to take full control of the router's configuration settings;
some allow a local attacker to bypass authentication directly and take control. This
control allows an attacker to intercept and modify network traffic as it enters and
leaves the network.

**UPDATE:** We have posted an [**additional study**](../../research/soho_service_hacks/) of
security vulnerabilities in extraneous, non-router services running on SOHO routers.

**UPDATE:** Learn more about this on CNET's
[article on our router hacks](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57579981-83/top-wi-fi-routers-easy-to-hack-says-study/) and
its [accompanying video](http://news.cnet.com/1606-2_3-50145624.html).

**INQUIRIES:** For more information on this
routers project, you can contact us at . For general inquiries, [click here to contact ISE](../../contact/).

## Introduction

ISE researchers have discovered critical security vulnerabilities in numerous small
office/home office (SOHO) routers and wireless access points. We define a critical
security vulnerability in a router as one that allows a remote attacker to take full
control of the router's configuration settings, or one that allows a local attacker
to bypass authentication and take control. This control allows an attacker to
intercept and modify network traffic as it enters and leaves the network.

* All 13 routers evaluated can be taken over from the local network
  + 4 of these attacks require no active management session.
* 11 of 13 routers evaluated can be taken over from the WAN
  + 2 of these attacks require no active management session.

Â

### Motivation

Despite being widely distributed and deployed in nearly every modern home and small
office, SOHO networking equipment has received surprisingly little attention from
security researchers. Yet, these devices facilitate the connectivity and protection
(we hope) of millions of end-systems. The critical
vulnerabilities that persist in these widely used devices demonstrate an urgent need
for deeper scrutiny.

ISE initially set out to evaluate the security of ten popular, off-the-shelf SOHO
wireless routers. The final scope of the research project was expanded to include
thirteen unique devices. Our research indicates that a moderately skilled adversary
with LAN or WLAN access can exploit all thirteen routers. We also found that nearly
all devices had critical security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a
remote adversary, resulting in router compromise and unauthorized remote control. At
least half of the routers that provided network attached storage (NAS) were found to
be accessible by a remote adversary (full details will be disclosed in a future
article).

We further categorize these remotely and locally accessible vulnerabilities by
indicating their associated attack requirements:

* Trivial attacks can be launched directly against the router with no human
  interaction or access to credentials.
* Unauthenticated attacks require some form of human interaction, such as
  following a malicious link or browsing to an unsafe page, but do not require an
  active session or access to credentials.
* Authenticated attacks require that the attacker have access to credentials (or
  that default router credentials are usedâan all-too-common situation) or that a
  victim is logged in with an active session at the time of the attack.

Â

We considered client-side attacks to be in scope, so long as they consist entirely of
HTML and JavaScript code running in a web browser.

## Important notes

* Disclaimer. ISE did not exhaustively evaluate these routers, and in no way
  asserts that other product vulnerabilities do not exist. Many of these routers
  enable by defaultâor provide the capability to enableâtelnet, ftp, and other
  services that have not been fully investigated. Our research was directed at
  assessing the ubiquity of these vulnerabilities, and not the number of issues
  present in any specific router model, or through any particular service or form
  of attack.
* Remote services. None of the routers evaluated enabled remote administration by
  default, or any remote services . However, this option is available to
  administrators, and if enabled, drastically increases the router's
  exploitability in each case. ISE recommends administrators not enable remote
  administration, or remote services under any circumstances.
* Remote compromise definition. We define remote compromise as full control of a
  router at the operating-system level by an adversary inside or outside of the
  router's domain.
* Fully updated. Prior to our evaluation, all routers were updated to the latest
  firmware, and tested with out-of-the-box configuration settings.

## Impact; new threats

SOHO router vulnerabilities impact consumers in a number of ways that differ from the
vulnerabilities that typically afflict end-systems, and through those
vulnerabilities new threats arise. The number of parties affected by an individual
or widespread router compromise is expanded, there could be lasting damage to users
or soho networking device vendors, and detecting or recovering from an exploit of
this type can be difficult.

### Affected parties: who is the victim?

A typical end-system compromise pegs the end-user as the victim. Certainly, advanced
threats leverage end-system compromise to gain a network foothold and attempt to
compromise lateral systems, but in general there is one victim, and one party
responsible for cleaning up the mess.

A SOHO router compromise not only affects that device, but the many end-systems it
supports, the infrastructure of which it is a part, the community of sites visited
by the end-users, and even the soho networking device vendor.

### Implications

The impact of these routers' security flaws is exacerbated by the fact that
unauthenticated attacks can target not only the administrator of a victim router's
(W)LAN, but any user on the (W)LAN. A parent or child in the case of the home, any
or all students behind a university router, or any guest or untrained user of a
small office or enterprise network can be targeted and leveraged to gain full
control of the SOHO networking device, which may also lead to additional attacks
being launched against other users.

### Significance of compromise

Once compromised, any routerâSOHO or otherwiseâmay be used by an adversary to secure
a man-in-the-middle position for launching more sophisticated attacks against all
users in the router's domain. This includes sniffing and rerouting all non-SSL
protected traffic, poisoning DNS resolvers, performing denial of service attacks, or
impersonating servers. Worse still, is that these routers are also firewalls, and
often represent the first (and last) line of defense for protecting the local
network. Once compromised, the adversary has unfettered access to exploit the
vulnerabilities of local area hosts that would be otherwise unreachable if the
router were enforcing firewall rules as intended.

### Difficult Recovery; Persistent issue

The overall community impact could be much worse. Considering that many soho
networking device administrators are not computer or security savvy, default
settings are undoubtedly prevalent. Even in the case where the vulnerabilities
identified here and elsewhere are addressed by the vendor, it may not be reasonable
to expect that SOHO networking device owners know about these issues, or will
upgrade/patch their routers' firmware, which is the predominant distribution
mechanism for SOHO networking device updates. In such cases, the vulnerabilities may
remain unresolved indefinitely.

"Bricking" of SOHO networking devices could also become an issue due to the
cumbersome and unauthenticated nature of the firmware upgrade process. As we've
identified, in all routers evaluated a remote adversary can replace a vendor's
firmware with their own. If such firmware were (intentionally) faulty, it could
render a device unusable. The damage to users and vendors could be significant
depending upon the number of devices in the field, the rate at which they can be
compromised or "bricked," and the cost to replace or repair them.

### Large-scale threats

So far we have acknowledged that users belonging to an affected router's domains are
at risk, but if any ISP deploys a router at scale with these types of
vulnerabilitiesâor has many customers using routers with these types of
vulnerabilitiesâan adversary may leverage the vulnerabilities to directly attack the
provider, core infrastructure, or other organizational targets, e.g., corporations
and nation-states. This also presents a large surface for new botnet deployment or
command and control (C2) strategies to facilitate DDoS attacks and cybercrime
activities.

## Mitigations

Unfortunately, there is little the average end-user can do to fully mitigate these
attacks. Successful mitigation often requires a level of sophistication and skill
beyond that of the average user (and beyond that of the most likely victims).

### Recommendations for Vendors

SOHO networking device VENDORS should take the following actions to help mitigate
these issues.

* Prepare and make available firmware upgrades that address these issues.
* Notify registered users of these vulnerabilities, and distribute instructions on
  how to upgrade device firmware.
* Regularly audit devices for security vulnerabilities, produce and distribute
  security patches in a timely manner, and notify registered customers.

Â

SOHO networking device VENDORS should incorporate the following design changes in to
their product lines.

* Using authenticated (digitally signed, and verifiable by the router) firmware
  updates.
* Designing a method for automatic firmware updates, that can be opted out of by
  users.
* Perform regular security audits to ensure devices are as hardened as possible.

### Recommendations for Device Administrators

SOHO networking device ADMINISTRATORS should take the following actions to help
mitigate these issues.

* Upgrade your firmware regularly.
* Disable (or do not enable) remote administration.
* Disable (or do not enable) network services that are not utilized within the
  LAN, e.g., FTP, SMB, UPnP.
* Log out from, and restart, your SOHO networking device after logging in for
  administrative tasks.
* Clear browser cookies and active logins after logging out from your router.
* Choose a non-standard (W)LAN IP address range (subnet), which will make generic
  automated attacks less effective against your network.
* If possible, enable HTTPS for all administrative connections. For all of the
  routers we evaluated that had this feature, it was disabled by default.
* Make sure your WLAN is protected using WPA2 encryption and is not left as an
  open WiFi network or protected with the outdated WPA or WEP standards.
* ONLY install firmware from the router manufacturers website.
* Choose a secure router administration password consisting of upper/lowercase
  alphanumeric and special characters that is at least 12 characters in length.
* If your SOHO device is behind an additional firewall, restrict inbound access to
  this device from the greater WAN.

### Recommendations for End Users

END-USERS behind SOHO networking devices should take the following actions to help
mitigate these issues.

* Do not discount browser or other software warnings of potential MITM attacks.
* Do not follow links sent through email or by other means, especially ones that
  are directed to what could potentially be a SOHO networking device (e.g.,
  192.168.2.1).
* Be diligent, and browse safely.

## Related Work

As stated earlier in this article, there has been little research published in the
area of SOHO router security, however some interesting results have been disclosed
by security researchers in recent years.

In March, 2013, Michael Messner [disclosed vulnerabilities](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/03/28/weekly-update) ranging
from minor to critical in D-Link, TP-Link, Netgear, and Linksys routers. The
vulnerabilities disclosed included authenticated and unauthenticated arbitrary
command injection, information disclosure, unencrypted password storage, directory
traversal, and persistent cross-site scripting.

In January, 2013, HD Moore disclosed that [numerous home routers exposed UPnP services](https://community.rapid7.com/docs/DOC-2150),
including SSDP Discovery and SOAP, to the Internet (WAN) side of the device. This
could lead to remote attackers modifying firewall rules or accessing private media
files using DLNA. Worse, many of the UPnP implementations had numerous buffer
overflow vulnerabilities.

Also in January, 2013, DefenseCode released [an advisory](http://www.defensecode.com/public/DefenseCode_Broadcom_Security_Advisory.pdf) describing a remote,
unauthenticated format string vulnerability in the Broadcom UPnP software that
escalated to root shell access.

At BlackHat 2012, Phil Purviance (Superevr) [demonstrated](https://superevr.com/blog/) a cross-site file
upload vulnerability in the Linksys WRT54GL. In early 2013, Purviance researched the
Linksys EA2700 and found numerous vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting,
directory and file traversal, unauthenticated password changes, and source code
disclosure vulnerabilities.

In May, 2012, [it was disclosed](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/723755) that WiFi Protected Setup (WPS)
uses an eight-digit PIN for authentication, and an attacker can determine if the
first four digits of an attempted PIN are correct, without regard to the last four.
Worse, as this CERT vulnerability disclosed, many home routers fail to implement any
rate limiting after successive incorrect PIN attempts.

At [BlackHat 2009](http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/LINDNER/BHUSA09-Lindner-RouterExploit-SLIDES.pdf), Felix Lindner
explored the feasibility and techniques that could be used to attack commercial
grade routers. He found very few public vulnerabilities in this class of equipment.

## Future work

Six months after releasing the advisories for the 13 routers, ISE will upgrade the
firmware on all 13 routers and perform a reassessment to determine whatâif
anyâimpact deeper scrutiny from the security community has brought to the SOHO
router industry. ISE may also expand the scope of the next study to include
additional routers.
