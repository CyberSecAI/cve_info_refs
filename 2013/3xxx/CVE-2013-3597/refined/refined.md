Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3597:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper access control to sensitive data within the SearchBlox application. Specifically, the application fails to restrict access to a servlet that displays a list of collections, which includes user credentials.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Exposure (CWE-200):**  The application exposes usernames and passwords stored in the database to unauthorized users. This is achieved by accessing a specific URL,  `/searchblox/servlet/CollectionListServlet?action=getList&orderBy=colName&direction=asc`, which returns a list including user credentials in clear text.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain access to user credentials (usernames and passwords), potentially leading to unauthorized access to the application and associated data.
*   The attacker can compromise the confidentiality of the system's data

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploited through a simple HTTP GET request to a specific URL on the affected SearchBlox instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Access:**  The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability. They simply need to be able to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable SearchBlox server.

**Additional notes:**

*   This vulnerability is one of three vulnerabilities identified in SearchBlox, the others being CVE-2013-3590 (Command Injection) and CVE-2013-3598 (External Control of File Name or Path).
*   The vulnerability is addressed in SearchBlox version 7.5 build 1 or later.
