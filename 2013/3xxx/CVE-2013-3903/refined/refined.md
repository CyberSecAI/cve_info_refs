This document provides details on multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-101. Here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3903:

**Vulnerability:** TrueType Font Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3903

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel-mode driver failing to perform sufficient validation when loading a TrueType font file. Specifically, the driver does not properly validate array indexes.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Improper input validation leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could cause the target system to stop responding and restart, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker could embed a specially crafted TrueType font on a website. When a user visits the site, the browser attempts to render the font. The malformed font then exploits the vulnerability, causing the system to crash.
    *   Compromised websites and websites that accept user provided content or advertisements could also contain the crafted font.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to host a website with the specially crafted font file, or compromise a website to host it. The user needs to be convinced to visit this website by clicking on a link.
