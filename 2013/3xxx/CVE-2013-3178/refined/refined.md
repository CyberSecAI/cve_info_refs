    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Silverlight improperly handles a dereference to a null pointer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of a null pointer dereference."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on behalf of the targeted user, potentially gaining the same user rights as the logged-on user.

    "attack_vectors": [
      "A web-based attack where an attacker hosts a website containing a specially crafted Silverlight application designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to view the website.",
      "Compromised websites or websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could also be used for the same purpose.",
       "Specially crafted web content may also be displayed by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver web content to affected systems"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a website hosting the malicious Silverlight application, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by opening an attachment sent through email."
