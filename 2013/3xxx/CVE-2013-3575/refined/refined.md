Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3575:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program** (CWE-98): The vulnerability stems from how the application handles file paths in PHP include/require statements. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input used to specify which file to include.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The application allows an attacker to include local files within the "<document-root>/hpdiags/frontend2/help/" directory using the `path` parameter in the `pageview.php` script. The attacker can specify the name of a file located inside that directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially read sensitive data or execute malicious code by including specifically crafted files, which could lead to further compromise of the system. While the vulnerability is limited to files ending in ".html" within the specified directory, a cleverly crafted malicious .html file could potentially be used for further attacks.
*   Combined with other vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-3573 and CVE-2013-3574), this vulnerability could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is accessed via HTTP requests to the `pageview.php` script.
*   **Specifically Crafted URL:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted GET request to the `pageview.php` script containing the malicious file path via the `path` parameter: `https://<host>:2381/hpdiags/frontend2/help/pageview.php?path=comparesurvey.html`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable server on port 2381.
*   **Authenticated User:**  Although not explicitly stated for the LFI vulnerability, it is mentioned that combined with other vulnerabilities, it can be exploited by an *authenticated* remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands. It can be inferred that authentication might be required to reach the vulnerable `pageview.php` script.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content notes that this vulnerability is fixed in HP Insight Diagnostics 9.52, suggesting an upgrade as a solution
* The impact of this vulnerability is elevated due to its combination with other vulnerabilities found in the same product.
