## Update FAQ

**If I applied the automated Microsoft Fix it solution previously described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2896666, should I** **undo the workaround after applying this update?**

Yes, customers should undo the workaround after applying this update. If you do not undo the workaround at some point, you will not be able to properly view TIFF files.

To undo the **Microsoft Fix it solution**, you can follow the steps in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2908005](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2908005).

**If I applied the** **Disable data collaboration in Lync workaround** **previously described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2896666,** **should I** **undo the workaround after applying this update?**

Yes, customers who have disabled collaboration in Lync should undo the workaround after applying the update. If you do not undo the workaround, you will not be able to share and collaborate on PowerPoint files, polls, and Whiteboard during Lync meetings.

To undo the **Disable data collaboration in Lync** workaround, see the **Workarounds** section in this bulletin.

[1]Applies to Windows XP Service Pack 3 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2.

[2]Not a supported configuration for Microsoft Office or Microsoft Lync. It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555).

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335. For a list of Microsoft Office products an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not vulnerable. Why am I being offered this update?**

In some cases, an update may apply to Microsoft Office products that are specifically listed in the Non-Affected Software table or that are otherwise listed in the Affected Software table with "Not applicable" for security impact. For example, you may be offered a Microsoft Office security update even though this security bulletin indicates that the Office products or the version of the Office products that you do have installed are not affected. For more information on this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335).

**I do** **not have Microsoft Lync 2013 software installed. Why am I being offered an update for Microsoft Lync 2013?**

You may be offered an update for Microsoft Lync 2013 even though you do not have the affected software installed, if you have Microsoft Office software that contains the vulnerable shared component of Microsoft Office 2013 and Microsoft Lync 2013. Note that because the software does not access the vulnerable code, the software is not affected by the vulnerability. However, since the vulnerable code is present, this update will be offered.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office software constitute an issue in the servicing model for Microsoft Office updates?**

No. The servicing model is based on how the update applies to shared components of Microsoft Office software. Some of the products offered an update may not access the vulnerable code, and thus the software is not affected by the vulnerability. However, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a product version for applicable software on the system that is within the range of product versions that the update applies to, and thus offers the update. This helps to maintain consistency for shared files across Office products.

**Why is the Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) update only available from the Microsoft Download Center?**

Microsoft is releasing the update for Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) to the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129) only. Because the user level installation of Lync 2010 Attendee is handled through a Lync session, distribution methods such as automatic updating are not appropriate for this type of installation scenario.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## Microsoft Graphics Component Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3906

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected Windows components and other affected software handle specially crafted TIFF files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views TIFF files in shared content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3906](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3906).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the TIFF codec**

  **Note**Â See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2908005](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2908005) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  **Note**Â This workaround is not applicable to Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT, and Windows RT 8.1.

  You can prevent TIFF files from being displayed by modifying the registry to control the parsing of the TIFF codec. By changing the registry entries, you can control which images are parsed and rendered and which images are rejected in GDI+. For example, you can select to parse and render Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) images, but block Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images.

  **Warning**: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **Note** After you change a registry entry, you must restart the application that uses the codec.

  To disable the TIFF codec:

  1. To add a registry entry, create one of the following registry subkeys for the
     appropriate Windows platform:

     For 32-bit systems:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Gdiplus

     For 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Gdiplus

     For 64-bit systems:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Gdiplus
  2. Create a **DWORD** value for the TIFF code by creating a registry entry (**DWORD** value) under the registry subkey you created in step 1:

     **DisableTIFFCodec**
  3. To disable the TIFF codec, set value of the **DisableTIFFCodec** registry entry to **1**.

  **Impact of Workaround.** You will not be able to view TIFF files using any of the affected products.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  To re-enable the TIFF codec, set the value of the **DisableTIFFCodec** registry entry to **0**.
* **Disable data collaboration in Lync**

  Enterprise users who manage directly a Lync server can prevent PowerPoint files (which may be used as an attack vector to send specially crafted TIFF files) from being shared through Lync by using the Lync Server Control Panel to modify the Lync conferencing policy for data collaboration.

  **For Lync 2010 and Lync 2013:**

  1. Open the Lync Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server Administrative Tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg195741.aspx).
  2. In the left navigation bar, click **Conferencing** and then click **Conferencing Policy**.
  3. In the list of conferencing policies, click **Data collaboration**, click **Edit**, and then click **Show details**.
  4. To prevent data collaboration, in **Edit Conferencing Policy**, click **None**. The default setting is **Enable data collaboration**.
  5. Click **Commit**.

  **Impact of Workaround.** Users will not be able to share and collaborate on PowerPoint files, polls, and Whiteboard during Lync meetings.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  To re-enable data collaboration:

  1. Open the Lync Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server Administrative Tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg195741.aspx).
  2. In the left navigation bar, click **Conferencing** and then click **Conferencing Policy**.
  3. In the list of conferencing policies, click **Data collaboration**, click **Edit**, and then click **Show details**.
  4. To enable data collaboration, in **Edit Conferencing Policy**, click **Enable data collaboration**.
  5. Click **Commit**.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, or Microsoft Lync fails to properly handle specially crafted TIFF files. System memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What is GDI+?**

GDI+ is a graphics device interface that provides two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography to applications and programmers.

**What is a TIFF file?**

A TIFF (tagged image file format) file allows information to be embedded in the image file, such as the compression scheme, color mode, and size.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opens a specially crafted file or browses a website that contains specially crafted content. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are multiple means that could allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted Office data in the contents of an email message. The vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens or previews the specially crafted email message in Outlook while using Microsoft Word as the email reader. Note that by default, Microsoft Word is not the email reader in Outlook 2003. An attacker could also exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office file to the user, and then convincing the user to open the file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In a local attack scenario, an attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application to take complete control over the affected system. However, the attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability in this scenario.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers running affected software are primarily at risk.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in affected software on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with the affected software.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way the affected software handles TIFF files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2013-3906](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3906). This vulnerability was first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2896666](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2896666).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability in Microsoft Office products.

## Update FAQ

**If I applied the automated Microsoft Fix it solution previously described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2896666, should I** **undo the workaround after applying this update?**

Yes, customers should undo the workaround after applying this update. If you do not undo the workaround at some point, you will not be able to properly view TIFF files.

To undo the **Microsoft Fix it solution**, you can follow the steps in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2908005](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2908005).

**If I applied the** **Disable data collaboration in Lync workaround** **previously described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2896666,** **should I** **undo the workaround after applying this update?**

Yes, customers who have disabled collaboration in Lync should undo the workaround after applying the update. If you do not undo the workaround, you will not be able to share and collaborate on PowerPoint files, polls, and Whiteboard during Lync meetings.

To undo the **Disable data collaboration in Lync** workaround, see the **Workarounds** section in this bulletin.

**Based on the configuration of my system, how do I know if my system is affected?**

[1]Applies to Windows XP Service Pack 3 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2.

[2]Not a supported configuration for Microsoft Office or Microsoft Lync. It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555).

**I am being offered this update for software that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table. Why am I being offered this update?**

When updates address vulnerable code that exists in a component that is shared between multiple Microsoft Office products or shared between multiple versions of the same Microsoft Office product, the update is considered to be applicable to all supported products and versions that contain the vulnerable component.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2007 products, only Microsoft Office 2007 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Visio 2007, Microsoft Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2007 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For example, when an update applies to Microsoft Office 2010 products, only Microsoft Office 2010 may be specifically listed in the Affected Software table. However, the update could apply to Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Visio 2010, Microsoft Visio Viewer, or any other Microsoft Office 2010 product that is not specifically listed in the Affected Software table.

For more information on this behavior and recommended actions, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335. For a list of Microsoft Office products an update may apply to, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article associated with the specific update.

**I am being offered this update for software that is not vulnerable. Why am I being offered this update?**

In some cases, an update may apply to Microsoft Office products that are specifically listed in the Non-Affected Software table or that are otherwise listed in the Affected Software table with "Not applicable" for security impact. For example, you may be offered a Microsoft Office security update even though this security bulletin indicates that the Office products or the version of the Office products that you do have installed are not affected. For more information on this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335).

**I do** **not have Microsoft Lync 2013 software installed. Why am I being offered an update for Microsoft Lync 2013?**

You may be offered an update for Microsoft Lync 2013 even though you do not have the affected software installed, if you have Microsoft Office software that contains the vulnerable shared component of Microsoft Office 2013 and Microsoft Lync 2013. Note that because the software does not access the vulnerable code, the software is not affected by the vulnerability. However, since the vulnerable code is present, this update will be offered.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office software constitute an issue in the servicing model for Microsoft Office updates?**

No. The servicing model is based on how the update applies to shared components of Microsoft Office software. Some of the products offered an update may not access the vulnerable code, and thus the software is not affected by the vulnerability. However, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a product version for applicable software on the system that is within the range of product versions that the update applies to, and thus offers the update. This helps to maintain consistency for shared files across Office products.

**Why is the Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) update only available from the Microsoft Download Center?**

Microsoft is releasing the update for Lync 2010 Attendee (user level install) to the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129) only. Because the user level installation of Lync 2010 Attendee is handled through a Lync session, distribution methods such as automatic updating are not appropriate for this type of installation scenario.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## Microsoft Graphics Component Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2013-3906

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected Windows components and other affected software handle specially crafted TIFF files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user views TIFF files in shared content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2013-3906](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3906).

#### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the TIFF codec**

  **Note**Â See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2908005](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2908005) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  **Note**Â This workaround is not applicable to Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT, and Windows RT 8.1.

  You can prevent TIFF files from being displayed by modifying the registry to control the parsing of the TIFF codec. By changing the registry entries, you can control which images are parsed and rendered and which images are rejected in GDI+. For example, you can select to parse and render Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) images, but block Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images.

  **Warning**: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **Note** After you change a registry entry, you must restart the application that uses the codec.

  To disable the TIFF codec:

  1. To add a registry entry, create one of the following registry subkeys for the
     appropriate Windows platform:

     For 32-bit systems:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Gdiplus

     For 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Gdiplus

     For 64-bit systems:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Gdiplus
  2. Create a **DWORD** value for the TIFF code by creating a registry entry (**DWORD** value) under the registry subkey you created in step 1:

     **DisableTIFFCodec**
  3. To disable the TIFF codec, set value of the **DisableTIFFCodec** registry entry to **1**.

  **Impact of Workaround.** You will not be able to view TIFF files using any of the affected products.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  To re-enable the TIFF codec, set the value of the **DisableTIFFCodec** registry entry to **0**.
* **Disable data collaboration in Lync**

  Enterprise users who manage directly a Lync server can prevent PowerPoint files (which may be used as an attack vector to send specially crafted TIFF files) from being shared through Lync by using the Lync Server Control Panel to modify the Lync conferencing policy for data collaboration.

  **For Lync 2010 and Lync 2013:**

  1. Open the Lync Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server Administrative Tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg195741.aspx).
  2. In the left navigation bar, click **Conferencing** and then click **Conferencing Policy**.
  3. In the list of conferencing policies, click **Data collaboration**, click **Edit**, and then click **Show details**.
  4. To prevent data collaboration, in **Edit Conferencing Policy**, click **None**. The default setting is **Enable data collaboration**.
  5. Click **Commit**.

  **Impact of Workaround.** Users will not be able to share and collaborate on PowerPoint files, polls, and Whiteboard during Lync meetings.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  To re-enable data collaboration:

  1. Open the Lync Control Panel. For details about the different methods you can use to start Lync Server Control Panel, see [Open Lync Server Administrative Tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg195741.aspx).
  2. In the left navigation bar, click **Conferencing** and then click **Conferencing Policy**.
  3. In the list of conferencing policies, click **Data collaboration**, click **Edit**, and then click **Show details**.
  4. To enable data collaboration, in **Edit Conferencing Policy**, click **Enable data collaboration**.
  5. Click **Commit**.

#### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, or Microsoft Lync fails to properly handle specially crafted TIFF files. System memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What is GDI+?**

GDI+ is a graphics device interface that provides two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography to applications and programmers.

**What is a TIFF file?**

A TIFF (tagged image file format) file allows information to be embedded in the image file, such as the compression scheme, color mode, and size.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opens a specially crafted file or browses a website that contains specially crafted content. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are multiple means that could allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the document file.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted Office data in the contents of an email message. The vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens or previews the specially crafted email message in Outlook while using Microsoft Word as the email reader. Note that by default, Microsoft Word is not the email reader in Outlook 2003. An attacker could also exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office file to the user, and then convincing the user to open the file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In a local attack scenario, an attacker could also exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application to take complete control over the affected system. However, the attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability in this scenario.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers running affected software are primarily at risk.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in affected software on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with the affected software.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way the affected software handles TIFF files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2013-3906](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-3906). This vulnerability was first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2896666](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2896666).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

          This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft's Tagged Image File Format.
          It was originally discovered in the wild, targeting Windows XP and Windows Server 2003
          users running Microsoft Office, specifically in the Middle East and South Asia region.

          The flaw is due to a DWORD value extracted from the TIFF file that is embedded as a
          drawing in Microsoft Office, and how it gets calculated with user-controlled inputs,
          and stored in the EAX register. The 32-bit register will run out of storage space to
          represent the large vlaue, which ends up being 0, but it still gets pushed as a
          dwBytes argumenet (size) for a HeapAlloc call. The HeapAlloc function will allocate a
          chunk anyway with size 0, and the address of this chunk is used as the destination buffer
          of a memcpy function, where the source buffer is the EXIF data (an extended image format
          supported by TIFF), and is also user-controlled. A function pointer in the chunk returned
          by HeapAlloc will end up being overwritten by the memcpy function, and then later used
          in OGL!GdipCreatePath. By successfully controlling this function pointer, and the
          memory layout using ActiveX, it is possible to gain arbitrary code execution under the
          context of the user.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 â Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 â Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 â Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 â Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products.Â Likewise, theÂ rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.Â Â In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."Â  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 isÂ â2âÂ and the rating for Windows 7 isÂ â1â, the rating will reflect â1â.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** â A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** â The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security updateâs release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month â thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
