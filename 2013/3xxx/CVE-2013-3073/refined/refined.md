{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Samba service on the affected routers is misconfigured to allow the creation of symbolic links that point to arbitrary destinations, including outside of the intended SMB share and into the router's root file system.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default configuration of the Samba service, specifically the 'wide links' option.",
      "Lack of input validation when handling symbolic links.",
       "Insufficient access controls on system files that can be accessed via symlinks",
      "Lack of user configurable options to correct this misconfiguration."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use this vulnerability to gain access to the router's file system, read sensitive data, and potentially modify system configurations or execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local network (LAN/WLAN) access to the SMB service.",
       "Exploitation of other vulnerabilities to gain access to SMB service"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have access to the SMB service via other means. No authentication is needed by default for some routers to access the SMB shares."

  "additional_notes": "The provided text indicates that this issue is present across many SOHO routers, and that in many cases, this configuration cannot be modified by the user without root access. This is a component in a larger set of vulnerabilities in these devices that often lead to full compromise. Some of these symlink attacks were previously documented (CVE-2013-4855, CVE-2013-4658, CVE-2013-3073)"
