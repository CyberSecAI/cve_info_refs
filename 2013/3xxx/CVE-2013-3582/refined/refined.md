    {
      "source": "media.blackhat.com_edfd5317_20250124_190612.html",
      "root_cause": "The Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM) implementation in the BIOS does not adhere to the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) PC client specification and NIST guidance, leading to incomplete measurements and the possibility of undetected modifications.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The SRTM only measures a small portion of the BIOS, leaving most of it unmonitored for changes.",
        "PCRs 1, 2, and 3 are not properly measured and instead contain duplicated values.",
        "The BIOS allows direct overwriting of the flash chip if not properly configured.",
         "The system may not enforce signed BIOS updates, making it vulnerable to unauthorized modifications."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can modify the SRTM and forge PCR0, subverting the entire chain of trust. The attacker can introduce persistent malware that survives BIOS updates.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Direct modification of the BIOS via a kernel module.",
         "Exploiting a buffer overflow in the BIOS update process to bypass signed update enforcement.",
         "Modifying the SRTM to report a false \"pristine\" state of the BIOS."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to gain root or administrative privileges to execute a malicious BIOS update or be able to reflash the BIOS directly. Physical access to the system is not required."

      "root_cause": "Buffer overflows in Dell BIOS in some older Latitude laptops and Precision Mobile Workstations.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflows in the rbu_packet.pktNum and rbu_packet.pktSize values during BIOS updates.",
        "The BIOS reads these values before any signature checks occur."

       "root_cause": "The BIOS and thus SRTM can be manipulated either due to a configuration that does not enable signed BIOS updates, or via an exploit that allows for BIOS reflash even in the presence of a signed update requirement.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Configuration that does not enable signed BIOS updates.",
        "Exploit that allows for BIOS reflash even when signed updates are required.",
        "A 51-byte patch to the SRTM allows it to provide a forged measurement to the TPM indicating the BIOS is pristine."
