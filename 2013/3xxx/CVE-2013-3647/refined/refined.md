Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3647:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `WebView` class of the Cybozu Live for Android application. Specifically, it's due to the application's handling of `file://` hyperlinks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper handling of `file://` hyperlinks within the `WebView` component.
*   Lack of sufficient sanitization or validation of file paths when processing `file://` URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   If a malicious file is present on the user's Android device, clicking a crafted `file://` hyperlink within the Cybozu Live app can lead to the execution of that malicious file.
*   This can result in the disclosure of information managed by the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a malicious file being present on the user's Android device and a user being tricked into clicking a `file://` hyperlink pointing to the malicious file within the Cybozu Live application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to convince the user to store a malicious file on their device.
*   The attacker needs to deliver a `file://` hyperlink, likely through the Cybozu Live application interface, that targets the malicious file.
*   The attacker can leverage a standard action like clicking a link to exploit the vulnerability, although the user would need to be convinced to perform the action.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was initially present in version 1.0.4 and earlier of Cybozu Live for Android, and was later reintroduced in version 2.0.0 as a regression.
*   The severity is rated as "High" in terms of access required, "Mid" for user interaction, and "Mid-High" for exploit complexity. The authentication required is rated as "Low-Mid".
*   The vulnerability was reported by Gaku Mochizuki of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.

The vulnerability is related to insecure handling of file URIs in the WebView component which allows for arbitrary local file access.
