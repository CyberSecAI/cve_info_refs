Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-3107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   vCenter Server, when deployed in an environment using Active Directory (AD) with anonymous LDAP binding enabled, incorrectly handles login credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Credential Bypass:** The vulnerability allows authentication with a valid username and a blank password, even when a non-blank password is required for the account. This bypass is possible due to the improper handling of login credentials when anonymous LDAP binding is enabled in Active Directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to vCenter Server by using a blank password for a valid account. This could lead to further malicious activities within the vCenter Server environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the vCenter Server login interface.
*   The attacker would need to target an environment where vCenter Server is configured to use Active Directory with anonymous LDAP binding enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have knowledge of a valid username within the vCenter Server's Active Directory environment.
*   The attacker must be able to access the vCenter Server login interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in vCenter Server versions 5.1, 5.1a, and 5.1b if AD anonymous LDAP binding is enabled.
*   The issue is resolved in vCenter Server 5.1 Update 1, which removes the ability to authenticate using blank passwords, regardless of whether anonymous binding is enabled.
*   A workaround involves disabling AD anonymous LDAP binding.
*   Anonymous binding is not enabled by default.
