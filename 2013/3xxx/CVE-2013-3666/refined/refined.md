### CVE-2013-3666
The provided content contains information about the CVE-2013-3666 vulnerability, it describes the command injection vulnerability in LG Optimus G devices.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation within LG's "HiddenMenu" application. Specifically, the "Wi-Fi Ping Test/User Command" feature allows execution of arbitrary shell commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The application allows a user-supplied string to be directly executed as a system command without proper sanitization.
- Privilege Escalation: The injected command runs as the "system" user, granting extensive permissions.
- Exposed functionality: The HiddenMenu application provides the vulnerable feature, which is not intended for general users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full control over the device
- Privilege escalation to the system user.
- Data exfiltration and manipulation
- Installation of malicious applications
- Device compromise and potential for further attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the device's dialer application.
- Using a specific dial code to access the hidden menu `3845#*XXX#`, where XXX is the model number.
- Navigating through the hidden menu to the "Wi-Fi Ping Test/User Command" and "User Command" option.
- Inputting a malicious command string.
- Executing the command by pressing cancel instead of OK.
- Automated exploit using ADB to simulate the necessary taps and key presses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access to the device, or remote access through ADB debugging.
- Knowledge of the specific dial code and menu options to trigger the vulnerability.
- Ability to formulate shell commands to execute.
