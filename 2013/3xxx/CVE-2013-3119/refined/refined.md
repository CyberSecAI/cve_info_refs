Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of memory objects leading to memory corruption. This can allow an attacker to overwrite critical parts of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability. By convincing a user to visit this website via a link in an email or IM message, or via a compromised website, the attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a malicious website:** The attacker needs a platform to host the specially crafted webpage.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious attachment.
*   **No prior authentication is required.**

**Additional Notes:**

*   This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS13-047.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) on various Windows operating systems.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" on client systems and "Moderate" on server systems.
