Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-3461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient rate limiting of traffic on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) port.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper rate limiting on the SIP port (port 5060). This allows an attacker to overwhelm the system with excessive traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful attack can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
*   The DoS condition is caused by the high volume of UDP packets sent to port 5060.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack is performed remotely over the network
*   Attackers can send a high volume of UDP packets to port 5060 of the affected device.
*   The attack can be launched by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device.
*   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Products**
* Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 8.5(x), 8.6(x) and 9.0(1)

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub35869.
*   The provided document mentions that the vulnerability was found during internal testing.
*   CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.5 (base) and 7.0 (temporal)

**Summary**
CVE-2013-3461 is a denial-of-service vulnerability affecting Cisco Unified Communications Manager due to insufficient rate limiting on the SIP port. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this by sending a high rate of UDP packets to port 5060, leading to a DoS condition.
