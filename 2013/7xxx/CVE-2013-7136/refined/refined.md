Root cause of vulnerability:
The Cisco EPC 2425 routers supplied by UPC use a weak algorithm to generate the default WPA-PSK passphrases. The passphrases are 8 characters long, uppercase letters only, which makes them vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Weak password generation algorithm using only uppercase letters and fixed length makes it vulnerable to brute force attacks.
- The default WPA-PSK password is not sufficiently complex, allowing for offline dictionary attacks.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to crack the WPA-PSK passphrase, gaining unauthorized access to the wireless network.

Attack vectors:
- Offline dictionary attack after obtaining the WPA-PSK handshake.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to capture a WPA-PSK handshake.
- Ability to perform a brute-force or dictionary attack using suitable hardware.
