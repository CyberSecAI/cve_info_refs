    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-7321",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities present in the D-Link DAP-2553 device.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Broken Authentication and Session Management: After a user successfully authenticates to the web GUI, an attacker who captures the IP address of the authenticated user has full access to the device without needing to re-authenticate. This allows users behind a proxy to gain access as they appear to share the same IP.",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Allows attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages, potentially bypassing access controls.",
        "Security Misconfiguration: The old admin password is sent in plain text via JavaScript during the page loading when attempting to change the admin password, making it easy to obtain with the weak authentication.",
         "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The web GUI does not use tokens, so an attacker can manipulate websites to have write access to the device configuration if a legitimate admin user has logged into the web GUI and in parallel opens a manipulated website."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain access to the device, modify its configuration, change the admin password, or cause the device to be unreliable.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Capturing the IP address of an authenticated user.",
        "Injecting client-side scripts into web pages.",
        "Manipulated websites used to send unauthorized requests to the device after a legitimate user has logged in."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to capture the IP address of an authenticated user or be able to have the user open a manipulated website after logging in."
