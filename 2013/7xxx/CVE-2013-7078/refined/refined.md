Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-7078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `errorAction` method in the `ActionController` base class of Extbase. This method returns error messages without properly encoding them. These error messages can contain user-provided input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Due to the lack of proper encoding of error messages that can contain user input, it is possible to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Phishing attacks
  - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to trigger an error within an Extbase-based TYPO3 extension.
- The extension must have the Rewritten Property Mapper enabled.
- The errorAction method of the controller must not be overridden to remove or sanitize the error messages.
- The attacker crafts a request that generates an error message containing malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required (for some cases):** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user if the affected extension/module is accessible without authentication.
- **Extbase extension must be installed:** An Extbase extension must be installed and accessible.
- **Rewritten Property Mapper enabled:** The extension/module must have the Rewritten Property Mapper enabled.
- **Vulnerable errorAction method:** The controller's `errorAction` method must not sanitize/remove the error messages.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in both TYPO3 CMS and TYPO3 Flow Framework.
- This issue has been actively exploited in the wild.
- The same vulnerability was assigned a separate ID for TYPO3 Flow due to different code base: TYPO3-FLOW-SA-2013-001.
