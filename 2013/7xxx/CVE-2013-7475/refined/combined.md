## FAQ

### How do I add a contact form to my WordPress website?

You can add the contact form in three ways:

1. Use shortcode [bestwebsoft\_contact\_form] in any post or page

2. Add the form as a widget through Appearance > Widgets

3. Use PHP code in your template files

### Is this plugin compatible with Contact Form 7 styles and templates?

While our plugin is a great alternative to Contact Form 7, it uses its own styling system. However, you can easily customize the form appearance to match your existing Contact Form 7 designs through our intuitive settings panel.

### Can I create multiple contact forms with different fields?

Yes, with our Contact Form Multi add-on, you can create unlimited forms with different fields, settings, and email recipients. Each form will have its own unique shortcode.

### How do I make my contact form GDPR compliant?

Our plugin includes built-in GDPR compliance features:

1. Enable privacy checkbox

2. Add custom privacy policy text

3. Include data processing information

### How can I protect my contact form from spam?

We offer multiple spam protection methods:

1. Integration with Google reCaptcha

2. Built-in Captcha support

3. Custom validation rules

4. Email filtering options

5. Honeypot fields

### Can I customize the email notifications?

Yes, you can customize:

1. Email recipients

2. Subject line

3. Message format

4. Reply-to address

5. Copy (CC) recipients

6. Auto-response messages

7. Email templates

### Does the contact form work with WordPress page builders?

– Elementor

– Divi Builder

– WPBakery Page Builder

– Gutenberg

– Beaver Builder

### How do I style my contact form to match my website design?

You can customize your form appearance through:

1. Built-in style settings

2. Custom CSS classes

3. Color picker for form elements

4. Field layout options

5. Responsive design settings

### Where can I find the settings to adjust the plugin work after activation?

You can find the link to the Settings Page in the Plugin menu.

### I haven’t adjusted the settings after the plugin installation. What is the default email address used for a contact via the form?

The address specified during WordPress installation will be used by the Contact Form plugin as the default one.

### I chose a user via the plugin settings and got this error: “Please enter a valid email address. Settings are not saved.”

This means that you made a syntax error.

### How to add the contact form not in English?

1. Add a language in the block “Language settings for the field names in the form” on the plugin settings page.
2. Mark the check box (if it’s not marked yet) in the block “Change the names of the contact form fields and error messages”, choose the necessary tab, click the arrow to expand the list of the fields and fill in the fields. Choose the necessary tab in the block “Action after email is sent” as well and fill in the field. Save the changes.
3. You will see the shortcode under the tab with the necessary language. Please paste that shortcode to the page or post.

### I’m not receiving messages from Contact Form OR the plugin does not send an email – “Sorry, email message could not be delivered.”

Please follow the instructions below:

1. Please check the plugin settings ‘/wp-admin/admin.php?page=contact\_form.php’ => ‘What to use?’ => change the lines from wp-mail to mail and vice versa.
2. Email messages can be marked as spam on the server. Please choose another email instead of the admin’s one (‘Use this email:’ block) – for example, gmail or similar. If the message is sent, it means that email filtering is set on your server. Please contact your hosting provider.
3. Perhaps email sending is not set. You should install an extra plugin called [SMTP by BestWebSoft](https://bestwebsoft.com/products/wordpress/plugins/smtp/) and configure it. Afterwards you should open the “Send A Test Email” tab on the plugin settings page, check an option “Display log”, send a test email and you will see if the plugin logs have errors.

Note: If the Contact Form sends letters, but you don’t receive them, you can install our plugin Contact Form to DB in order not to lose the sent letters for the time the problem is being solved.

Additional info:

[How to Use Contact Form – Step-by-step Instruction](https://bestwebsoft.com/documentation/contact-form/contact-form-user-guide/)

Submit a support request if the problem still remains. Please include the following information when contacting support:

1. URL of the page where Contact Form is located (make sure that the plugin is activated and the form is displayed on the page).

2. Log generated by the SMTP plugin after sending the test message.

[Submit a request](https://support.bestwebsoft.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)

### Why the contact form is displayed in one column, if I’ve chosen two columns displaying on the plugin settings page?

This happens when there is not enough the minimum width of the parent block where the contact form is located.

### Is it possible to create two contact forms using Contact Form?

Install and activate [Contact Form Multi](http://bestwebsoft.com/products/wordpress/plugins/contact-form-multi/?k=34543c152eff369d529e9b4da85985a9) in order to add unlimited number of forms to your WordPress website.

### I have some problems with the plugin’s work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support?

Please make sure that the problem hasn’t been discussed yet on our forum (<https://support.bestwebsoft.com>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem’s description:

1. the link to the page where the problem occurs
2. the name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version – your order number.
3. the version of your WordPress installation
4. copy and paste into the message your system status report. Please read more here: [Instruction on System Status](https://bestwebsoft.com/documentation/admin-panel-issues/system-status/)

I’ve been happily using the free version of this plug-in for many years and had been very pleased with it — thank you BestWesbSoft.
But a recent update meant it was un-useable for my customers. I raised a support issue, was then asked questions, which I immediately answered…and then nothing. No fix, no reply, just silence.

This app worked great, untill something went wrong and it stopped work. People cant send me a messages, they see in red “the message cant be send”. I don`t know what happened.
Then I triend to change some setting and it started working again, but I didnt see the messages in the text box. I decided to write the support team. They asked me for an acces to my admin wordpress panel and for ftp acces and I gave them the passords. They found and solve the problem fast. The support was great! Now I highly reccomend this plugin!

A PHP session was created by a session\_start() function call. This interferes with REST API and loopback requests. The session should be closed by session\_write\_close() before making any HTTP requests.

I needed hosting support to install the contact form because some adjustments were required by FTP. Also, the upgrade to contact form pro and multi didn’t go smoothly. WEBSOFT support was fast and effective, no major issues. Awesome support from Websoft tech. Many thanks!! I recommend Websoft contact form.
