How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE-2018-18245

      Maximilian Boehner of usd AG found a cross-site scripting (XSS)
      vulnerability in Nagios Core. This vulnerability allows attackers
      to place malicious JavaScript code into the web frontend through
      manipulation of plugin output. In order to do this the attacker
      needs to be able to manipulate the output returned by nagios
      checks, e.g. by replacing a plugin on one of the monitored
      endpoints. Execution of the payload then requires that an
      authenticated user creates an alert summary report which contains
      the corresponding output.

CVE-2016-9566

      It was discovered that local users with access to an account in
      the nagios group are able to gain root privileges via a symlink
      attack on the debug log file.

CVE-2014-1878

      An issue was corrected that allowed remote attackers to cause a
      stack-based buffer overflow and subsequently a denial of service
      (segmentation fault) via a long message to cmd.cgi.

CVE-2013-7205 | CVE-2013-7108

      A flaw was corrected in Nagios that could be exploited to cause a
      denial-of-service. This vulnerability is induced due to an
      off-by-one error within the process_cgivars() function, which can
      be exploited to cause an out-of-bounds read by sending a
      specially-crafted key value to the Nagios web UI.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.1.dfsg-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nagios3 packages.

The situation is a bit complicated but it appears that the best choice
is to add one CVE assignment.

As mentioned in the
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/12/16/4> post,
CVE-2013-7108 is for the <https://dev.icinga.org/issues/5251> report.
This mentions specific affected Icinga files. The issue in the same
files in Nagios has this same CVE ID.

Nagios changed two other files. The first file is contrib/daemonchk.c.
This is a fix for the same type of off-by-one issue covered by
CVE-2013-7108, but it was announced at a different time and therefore
is assigned a different CVE ID, CVE-2013-7205 for Nagios. Our
information from Icinga upstream is that the contrib/daemonchk.c code
isn't exposed to untrusted input with the Icinga distribution as
shipped, and would only be exposed if the user decides to change the
build/installation process. Therefore, Icinga upstream is not
accepting this as an Icinga vulnerability.

Another observation about contrib/daemonchk.c is that the
process_cgivars function apparently accomplishes nothing, and the call
and the code itself (with the originally erroneous length checking)
could perhaps just be omitted, because the variables[x] values are
never used. However, later use of the variables[x] values is
irrelevant to the reported attack possibility.

The second file is cgi/statuswml.c. Here, the Nagios commit adds a
block of new code -- this isn't an off-by-one change like the other
cases. As far as we can tell, this block of new code doesn't correct
any exploitable vulnerability and thus there won't be any associated
CVE ID. The code might be a good idea for consistency reasons, but we
didn't notice any viable attack that would involve long variables[x]
values.

Finally (although it's not directly relevant to CVE assignment),
Icinga does not use the cgi/statuswml.c code and is no longer even
shipping it.
