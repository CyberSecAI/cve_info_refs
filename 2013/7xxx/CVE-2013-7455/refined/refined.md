Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-7455

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the `DefaultICCintents` function within the Little CMS 2 library (`liblcms2`).
- The vulnerability occurs when the "Lut" cmsPipeline object is freed more than once during error recovery in the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free:** The core issue is that the `Lut` object is being freed twice. This leads to memory corruption. Specifically, the code had logic that would free `Lut` in a normal execution path, but also free it again in an error handling routine without checking if it was already freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on a vulnerable system.
- **Application Crash:** Exploitation can also lead to application crashes due to memory corruption.
- The level of impact depends on how the application uses `liblcms2` and the permissions of the application using the library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malformed ICC Profile:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malformed ICC profile. An attacker would need to craft an ICC profile that causes the double free to occur when the profile is processed by an application using the vulnerable version of `liblcms2`.
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted ICC profile to an application that uses a vulnerable version of the Little CMS library.
- No specific user privileges are required, other than those needed to interact with the application that processes the malicious ICC profile.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was corrected in 2013 by Marti Maria, but was not assigned a CVE identifier at the time and some vendors may not have updated. It was independently discovered and reported by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC.
- The fix was to add a check to ensure that the `Lut` variable is not freed if it's already NULL.
- The vulnerability is present in Little CMS 2.5 and earlier 2.x versions.
- Little CMS 2.6 has the fix.

This information provides more detail than the basic CVE description and highlights the specific conditions that lead to the double-free vulnerability.
