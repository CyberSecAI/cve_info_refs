## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (2977629)

Published: September 9, 2014 | Updated: December 19, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and thirty-six privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, and by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability entry later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For enterprise installations, or administrators and end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the **Affected Software** table in this bulletin.

For additional guidance, see the **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** section in this bulletin.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the XMLDOM ActiveX control allows local resources to be enumerated, resulting in an information disclosure.

**What is XMLDOM?**

The XML Document Object Model (DOM) class is an in-memory representation of an XML document. The DOM allows you to programmatically read, manipulate, and modify an XML document. The XmlReader class also reads XML; however, it provides non-cached, forward-only, read-only access. This means that there are no capabilities to edit the values of an attribute or content of an element, or the ability to insert and remove nodes with the XmlReader. Editing is the primary function of the DOM. It is the common and structured way that XML data is represented in memory, although the actual XML data is stored in a linear fashion when in a file or coming in from another object.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from this vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by limiting access to loaded resource data via XMLDOM.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.
* An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use these vulnerabilities to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an email message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of these vulnerabilities through the web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). This mode mitigates these vulnerabilities. See the FAQ section for these vulnerabilities for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this website to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click **Internet**.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  4. Click **Local intranet**.
  5. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all websites you visit to High.
  6. Click **OK** to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some websites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a website after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many websites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted websites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerabilities?**

These are remote code execution vulnerabilities in the context of the current user.

**What causes the vulnerabilities?**

When Internet Explorer improperly accesses an object in memory, it could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerabilities to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerabilities?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerabilities?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Can EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET could help mitigate exploits against these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

## In this article

Updated: October, 31 2016

## A

**Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)**

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a standards-based service that allows the secure sharing of identity information between trusted business partners (known as a federation) across an extranet. When a user needs to access a web application from one of its federation partners, the user's own organization is responsible for authenticating the user and providing identity information in the form of "claims" to the partner that hosts the web application. The hosting partner uses its trust policy to map the incoming claims to claims that are understood by its web application, which uses the claims to make authorization decisions.

**Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)**

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) moves executable images into random locations when a system boots, which helps prevent an attacker from leveraging data at predictable locations. For a component to support ASLR, all components that it loads must also support ASLR. For example, if A.exe consumes B.dll and C.dll, all three must support ASLR. By default, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 will randomize system DLLs and EXEs, but DLLs and EXEs created by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) must opt in to support ASLR using the /DYNAMICBASE linker option.

ASLR also randomizes heap and stack memory:

When an application creates a heap in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2, the heap manager will create that heap at a random location to help reduce the chance that an attempt to exploit a heap-based buffer overrun succeeds. Heap randomization is enabled by default for all applications running on Windows Vista and later.

* When a thread starts in a process linked with /DYNAMICBASE, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 move the thread's stack to a random location to help reduce the chance that a stack-based buffer overrun exploit will succeed.

**Always Encrypted**

Always Encrypted is a feature designed to protect sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or national identification numbers (e.g. U.S. social security numbers), stored in Azure SQL Database or SQL Server databases. Always Encrypted allows clients to encrypt sensitive data inside client applications and never reveal the encryption keys to the Database Engine (SQL Database or SQL Server). As a result, Always Encrypted provides a separation between those who own the data (and can view it) and those who manage the data (but should have no access

**Application Compatibility Infrastructure (AppCompat)**

The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure (AppCompat) is designed to preserve application functionality as the Microsoft Windows operating system changes from version to version. The AppCompat infrastructure allows for targeted fixes to specific applications and specific versions of applications, with these fixes being stored outside of the core Windows functions.

**ASP.NET**

ASP.NET is a collection of technologies within the Microsoft .NET Framework that enable developers to build Web applications and XML Web Services.

Unlike traditional Web pages, which use a combination of static HTML and scripting, ASP.NET uses compiled, event-driven pages. Because ASP.NET is a Web-based application environment, requiring an underlying Web server to provide basic HTTP functionality, ASP.NET runs on top of Internet Information Services (IIS). For more information, see [The Official Microsoft ASP.NET Site](https://www.asp.net/).

## C

**Certification Authority (CA)**

Certification authorities are the organizations that issue certificates. They establish and verify the authenticity of public keys that belong to people or other certification authorities, and they verify the identity of a person or organization that asks for a certificate.

**Certificate Trust List (CTL)**

A trust must exist between the recipient of a signed message and the signer of the message. One method of establishing this trust is through a certificate, an electronic document verifying that entities or persons are who they claim to be. A certificate is issued to an entity by a third party that is trusted by both of the other parties. So, each recipient of a signed message decides if the issuer of the signer's certificate is trustworthy. CryptoAPI has implemented a methodology to allow application developers to create applications that automatically verify certificates against a predefined list of trusted certificates or roots. This list of trusted entities (called subjects) is called a certificate trust list (CTL). For more information, please see the MSDN article, [Certificate Trust Verification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376546%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

**Cipher suite**

A cipher suite is a set of cryptographic algorithms. Schannel protocols use algorithms from a cipher suite to create keys and encrypt information. For more information about cipher suites, see [Cipher Suites in Schannel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374757%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

**Common Log File System (CLFS)**

The Common Log File System (CLFS) is a high-performance, general-purpose log file subsystem that dedicated client applications can use and multiple clients can share to optimize log access.

**Content Security Policy (CSP)**

Microsoft Edge now implements Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0. For extended details, see the [W3C Content Security Policy specification](https://www.w3.org/tr/2012/cr-csp-20121115/). The CSP security standard enables web developers to control the resources (JS, CSS, plugins, images, etc.) which a particular page can fetch or execute with the aim of preventing cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks seeking to execute malicious content in the context of a trusted web page. With CSP, web developers can create an allow list of sources of trusted content in the HTTP headers, pre-approving certain servers for content loaded into a webpage and instructing the browser to only execute or render resources from those sources.

**Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF)**

Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when a malicious website, email, blog, instant message, or program causes a userâs Web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site for which the user is currently authenticated.

**Cross-site scripting (XSS)**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a website. The vulnerability can affect web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the websites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify website content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**Cryptography**

Cryptography is the science of securing information by converting it between its normal, readable state (called plaintext) and one in which the data is obscured (known as ciphertext).

In all forms of cryptography, a value known as a key is used in conjunction with a procedure called a crypto algorithm to transform plaintext data into ciphertext. In the most familiar type of cryptography, secret-key cryptography, the ciphertext is transformed back into plaintext using the same key. However, in a second type of cryptography, public-key cryptography, a different key is used to transform the ciphertext back into plaintext.

**Cryptography Next Generation (CNG)**

Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) provides a flexible cryptographic development platform to create, update, and use custom cryptography algorithms in cryptography-related applications.

In information security, defense-in-depth refers to an approach in which multiple layers of defense are in place to help prevent attackers from compromising the security of a network or system.

**Digital Certificate**

In [public-key cryptography](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/92f9ye3s.aspx), one of the keys, known as the private key, must be kept secret. The other key, known as the public key, is intended to be shared with the world. Digital certificates are used primarily to verify the identity of a person or device, authenticate a service, or encrypt files. A digital certificate is a tamperproof piece of data that packages a public key together with information about it - who owns it, what it can be used for, when it expires, and so forth.

**Document Type Definition (DTD)**

DTD, standing for document type definition, is a file format type that is used in XML and other markup languages to identify the markup to be used to format a document.

**Domain Name System (DNS)**

Domain Name System (DNS), a locator service in Microsoft Windows, is an industry-standard protocol that locates computers on an IP-based network. IP networks, such as the Internet and Windows networks, rely on number-based addresses to process data.

## E

**Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)**

The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) is designed to help customers with their defense in depth strategies against cyberattacks, by helping detect and block exploitation techniques that are commonly used to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities. EMET helps protect against new and undiscovered threats even before they are formally addressed through security updates or antimalware software. EMET includes 14 security mitigations that complement other defense in-depth security measures, such as Windows Defender and antivirus software. EMET installs with default protection profiles, which are XML files that contain preconfigured settings for common Microsoft and third-party applications. For more information about EMET, see the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**Enhanced Metafile (EMF)**

EMF is a 32-bit format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. This format is an improvement over the Windows Metafile Format (WMF) and contains extended features.

For more information about image types and formats, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/320314). For additional information about graphics file formats, see MSDN article, [Metafiles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536391.aspx).

## H

**HTML Injection**

HTML injection is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject HTML code into a user's session with a website. The vulnerability can affect web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the websites that they frequent. An HTML injection attack does not modify website content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious HTML code that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**Hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI)**

Hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI) is a powerful system mitigation that leverages hardware virtualization and the Windows Hyper-V hypervisor to protect Windows kernel-mode processes against the injection and execution of malicious or unverified code. When HVCI is on, kernel mode code integrity validation is performed in a secure environment that is resistant to attack from malicious software, and page permissions for kernel mode are set and maintained by the Hyper-V hypervisor.

## I

**Internet Authentication Service (IAS)**

In Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. On Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, IAS does not support RADIUS Proxy because it is based on the Option Pack version.

In Windows Server 2003, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. As a RADIUS proxy, IAS forwards authentication and accounting messages to other RADIUS servers.

**Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)**

Internet Protocol security (IPSec) is a framework of open standards for helping to ensure private, secure communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks through the use of cryptographic security services. IPSec supports network-level data integrity, data confidentiality, data origin authentication, and replay protection. Because IPSec is integrated at the Internet layer (layer 3), it provides security for almost all protocols in the TCP/IP suite, and because IPSec is applied transparently to applications, there is no need to configure separate security for each application that uses TCP/IP.

**Input Method Editor (IME)**

Input Method Editors (IMEs) help solve an issue associated with entering information in certain languages via a keyboard. Languages like Chinese and Japanese contain thousands of different characters, and it isn't feasible to build a keyboard that includes all of them. IMEs allow the characters to be built using a standard 101-key keyboard, by specifying the strokes that compose each character.

An IME consists of an engine that converts keystrokes into phonetic and ideographic characters and a dictionary of commonly-used ideographic words. As the user enters keystrokes via the keyboard, the IME identifies the keystrokes and converts them into characters.

**Input/Output Control (IOCTL)**

Windows provides the ability for applications to directly request services of device drivers. The interface through which this is done is called an input/output control, or IOCTL.

**Internet Information Service (IIS)**

The Web Server (IIS) role in Windows Server provides a secure, easy-to-manage, modular and extensible platform for reliably hosting websites, services, and applications. For more information, see the TechNet article, [Web Server IIS Overview](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831725.aspx).

**IP Address and Domain Restrictions**

IP Address and Domain Restrictions is a Web Server (IIS) feature that allows the creation of rules that allow or deny access to content for a specific IP address, a range of IP addresses, or a domain name or set of domain names. These rules are also known as "white list" or âblack listâ rule sets.

All IP addresses, computers, and domains can access your site by default. To enhance security, you can restrict access to your site by creating a restriction rule for all IP addresses, a specific IP address, a range of IP addresses, or a specific domain or domains.

For example, if you have a site on an intranet server that is connected to the Internet, you can prevent Internet users from accessing your intranet site by allowing access only to members of your intranet, and explicitly denying access to outside users, see the article, [IP security](https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/ipsecurity).

## J

**JPEG**

JPEG is a platform-independent image format that supports a high level of compression. JPEG is a widely supported Internet standard developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group.

**JPEG XR**

JPEG XR (.XJR) is a Microsoft-developed JPEG file format for continuous tone images that supports higher compression ratios and color accuracy than the standard JPEG format.

## K

**Kerberos**

Kerberos is a protocol that is used to mutually authenticate users and services on an open and unsecured network. It allows services to correctly identify the user of a Kerberos ticket without having to authenticate the user at the service. It does this by using shared secret keys.

The Kerberos protocol uses shared secret keys to encrypt and sign users' credentials. A client is authenticated by a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC). After that authentication, the user can request a service ticket to access a specific service on the network. This ticket includes the encrypted and signed identity of the user.

Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) is a network service that supplies session tickets and temporary session keys to users and computers within an Active Directory domain. The KDC runs on each domain controller as part of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

**Kill Bits**

A security feature in Microsoft Internet Explorer makes it possible to prevent an ActiveX control from ever being loaded by the Internet Explorer HTML-rendering engine. This is done by making a registry setting and is referred to as setting the kill bit. After the kill bit is set, the control can never be loaded, even when it is fully installed. Setting the kill bit makes sure that even if a vulnerable component is introduced or is re-introduced to a system, it remains inert and harmless.

For more information on kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797).

## M

**Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack**

A man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attackerâs computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. Each user in the communication unknowingly sends traffic to and receives traffic from the attacker, all the while thinking they are communicating only with the intended user.

**Microsoft .NET Remoting**

Microsoft .NET Remoting is a technology that simplifies how applications communicate and share objects with other applications.

**Microsoft DirectShow**

DirectX consists of a set of low-level Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used by Windows programs for multimedia support. Within DirectX, the DirectShow technology performs client-side audio and video sourcing, manipulation and rendering.

Microsoft DirectShow is used for streaming media on Microsoft Windows operating systems. DirectShow is used for high-quality capture and playback of multimedia streams. It automatically detects and uses video and audio acceleration hardware when available, but also supports systems without acceleration hardware. DirectShow is also integrated with other DirectX technologies. Some examples of applications that use DirectShow include DVD players, video editing applications, AVI to ASF converters, MP3 players, and digital video capture applications.

**Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML)**

Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) allows customers who use JScript, Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 to develop XML-based applications that provide interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard. For more information, see the MSDN site, [MSXML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms763742.aspx).

**Mitigation**

Refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability.

## N

**Network Driver Interface Standard (NDIS)**

The Network Driver Interface Standard (NDIS) is part of the Windows Driver Kit, which is a fully integrated driver development system that contains the Windows Driver Device Kit and tests for stability and reliability of Windows drivers. The NDIS library abstracts the network hardware from network drivers. NDIS also specifies a standard interface between layered network drivers, thereby abstracting lower-level drivers that manage hardware from upper-level drivers, such as network transports. NDIS also maintains state information and parameters for network drivers, including pointers to functions, handles, and parameter blocks for linkage, and other system values.

**Network Location Awareness (NLA) service**

The Network Location Awareness service enables network-interacting programs to change their behavior based on how the computer is connected to the network. In the case of Windows Firewall with Advanced Security, you can create rules that apply only when the profile associated with a specific network location type is active on your computer.

**Network Policy Server (NPS)**

Network Policy Server (NPS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy in Windows Server 2008. NPS is the replacement for Internet Authentication Service (IAS) in Windows Server 2003. As a RADIUS server, NPS performs authentication, authorization, and accounting for wireless, authenticating switch, and remote access dial-up and virtual private network (VPN) connections.

**NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol**

NT LAN Manager (NTLM) Authentication Protocol is a protocol that uses a challenge-response mechanism for authentication in which clients are able to verify their identities without sending a password to the server. It consists of three messages, commonly referred to as Type 1 (negotiation), Type 2 (challenge), and Type 3 (authentication).

## O

**Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)**

A technology that allows applications to share data and functionality, such as the ability to create and edit compound data. Compound data is data that contains information in multiple formats. For example, a compound Microsoft Word document may contain an embedded Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (or OLE object). This technology also enables in-place editing; instead of launching a new application when an OLE object is activated, the user instead sees a new set of menu items inside their existing application. For more information about OLE, see [Compound Documents](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms693383).

## P

**PFS**

PFS is a property of key-agreement protocols that makes sure that a session key derived from a set of long-term keys will not be compromised if one of the long-term keys is compromised in the future.

**PGM**

PGM is a reliable and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss, request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the sender of responsibility for the reliability of communications. PGM is appropriate for applications that require duplicate-free multicast data delivery from multiple sources to multiple receivers. PGM does not support acknowledged delivery, nor does it guarantee ordering of packets from multiple senders. For more information on PGM, see the following [MSDN Article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740125%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**PNG**

PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics. The Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format was designed to replace the older and simpler GIF format and, to some extent, the much more complex TIFF format. Additional information about PNG can be found at the following [website](https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngintro.html).

## R

**Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)**

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a client-server networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA or Triple A) management for users who connect to a network service. RADIUS provided a central authentication and authorization service for all access requests that are sent by RADIUS clients. The RADIUS protocol manages access to the Internet or internal networks, wireless networks, and integrated e-mail services. These networks may incorporate modems, DSL, access points, VPNs, network ports, web servers, etc. Network Policy Server (NPS) can be used as a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server to perform authentication, authorization, and accounting for RADIUS clients.

**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**

Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) lets users create a virtual session on their desktop computers. RDP allows remote users to access all of the data and applications on their computers. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383015%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**

Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is an inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism that enables data exchange and invocation of functionality residing in a different process. That process can be on the same computer, on the local area network (LAN), or across the Internet. The Microsoft RPC mechanism uses other IPC mechanisms, such as named pipes, NetBIOS, or Winsock, to establish communications between the client and the server. With RPC, essential program logic and related procedure code can exist on different computers, which is important for distributed applications. For more information, see the TechNet article, [What Is RPC?](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc787851)

**RPC NDR Engine**

The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Network Data Representation (NDR) Engine is the marshaling engine of the RPC and DCOM components. The NDR Engine handles all stub-related issues of a remote call. As a process, NDR marshaling is driven by the C code from MIDL-generated stubs, a MIDL JIT-type generator, or by stubs generated by other tools or written manually. In turn, the NDR engine drives the underlying run time (DCOM or RPC) that communicates with specific transports.

## S

**Same Origin Policy**

The same-origin policy is used by web browsers to prevent a script loaded from one domain from getting or manipulating properties of a webpage from another domain. This means that, by default, the domain of a requested URL must be the same as the domain of the current webpage.

**Secure Channel (Schannel)**

The Secure Channel (Schannel) security package is a Security Support Provider (SSP) that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Internet standard authentication protocols. These components are used to implement secure communications in support of several common internet and network applications, such as web browsing. Schannel is part of the security package that helps provide an authentication service to provide secure communications between client and server. For more information, see [Secure Channel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380123%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**

The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is a predecessor of the Transport Layer Security protocol. It performs the same functions and supports secure network communications using a combination of public and secret key technology. For more information, see How [TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

Server Side Request Forgery (SSFR) is a type of attack that can allow an attacker to target internal systems behind the firewall that are normally inaccessible from the outside world. The attacker could then create requests which appear to come from the vulnerable server. In addition, an attacker can use SSRF attacks to:

* Scan and attack systems from the internal network that are not normally accessible
* Enumerate and attack services that are running on these hosts
* Exploit host-based authentication services

## T

**Task Scheduler**

Task Scheduler is a Windows feature that enables you to automatically perform routine tasks on a chosen computer. The Task Scheduler can be used to execute tasks such as starting an application, sending an email message, or showing a message box.

**Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol**

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol is responsible for the authentication and key exchange necessary to establish or resume secure sessions. For more information, see How [TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**Trusted Boot**

Trusted Boot is a Windows 8.1 feature that secures the entire Windows boot process. It prevents malware from hiding and taking up permanent residence within the PC by ensuring none of the Windows components loaded during boot have been tampered with. Trusted Boot also ensures that anti-malware software is loaded before any third-party drivers and applications using its Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) capability. This prevents malware from inserting itself in front of the anti-malware engine so that it can compromise the anti-malware engineâs ability to protect the system. In the event that malware was able to successfully compromise the any of the Windows boot process, Trusted Boot will attempt to automatically remediate the issue.

## U

**Uniscribe**

Uniscribe is a set of APIs that allow a high degree of control for fine typography and for processing complex scripts. Both complex scripts and simple scripts with fine typography effects require special processing to display and edit because the characters ("glyphs") are not laid out in a simple way. For complex scripts, the rules governing the shaping and positioning of glyphs are specified and catalogued in [The Unicode Standard](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=161643). For more information see [Uniscribe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374091%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

# Microsoft XMLDOM in IE can divulge information of local drive/network in error messages – XXE

While I was testing a XML Injection vulnerability, I became interested in the W3Schools DTD Validator example that can only work in IE: <http://www.w3schools.com/dtd/dtd_validation.asp> ([updated 24/10/2016] – link mirror: [https://web.archive.org/web/20130424001426/http://w3schools.com/dtd/dtd\_validation.asp](https://web.archive.org/web/20130424001426/http%3A//w3schools.com/dtd/dtd_validation.asp)). As a result, after I finished my testing, I started playing with this Microsoft XMLDOM object to see if it is vulnerable.

I created the following test case to manipulate the “$target$” value and validate it to see the results:

```

validateXML('<?xml version="1.0" ?><!DOCTYPE anything SYSTEM "$target$">')

function validateXML(txt) {
    // code for IE
    if (window.ActiveXObject) {
        var xmlDoc = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLDOM");
        xmlDoc.async = true;
        try {
            xmlDoc.loadXML(txt);
			if (xmlDoc.parseError.errorCode != 0) {
				var err;
				err = "Error Code: " + xmlDoc.parseError.errorCode + "\n";
				err += "Error Reason: " + xmlDoc.parseError.reason;
				err += "Error Line: " + xmlDoc.parseError.line;
				alert(err);
				var errReason = xmlDoc.parseError.reason.toLowerCase();
				alert(errReason);
			} else {
                alert('No Error? Unknown!')
			}
        } catch (e) {
            alert(e);
        }

    } else {
        alert('you need to use IE')
    }
}

```

You can see this JS in action via this link in IE: <http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/>

#### **Detecting files in the C drive:**

I tried different local file paths to see if I can include a file from the local file system. The results of the following test cases are the same – “Access is denied.”:

$target$=file://c:/windows/system32/calc.exe

$target$=file://c:/windows/system32/invalid.exe

See this link: <http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/1/>

I thought I might be able to use “\\localhost” or “\\127.0.0.1” instead of using “file” protocol:

$target$ = \\127.0.0.1\c$\windows\system32\calc.exe

$target$ = \\127.0.0.1\c$\windows\system32\invalid.exe

The result was the same again; however, I did not receive an “access denied” error this time! See this link: <http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/2/>

At this point, I used Sysinternals Suite Process Monitor to monitor the file system and I realised that in the previous example, it was looking for “c$” folder in the C drive!

Therefore, I removed “c$” from my targets and ran the test again:

$target$ = \\127.0.0.1\windows\system32\calc.exe

$target$ = \\127.0.0.1\windows\system32\invalid.exe

The result was promising as I received “Unspecified error” for the file that was available on my file system. See this: <http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/3/>

So, I found my first bypass to detect available files on the C drive.

I also found more vectors to find files on the C drive and it turned out that I can get the same result by using “file:\” and “file:\\localhost\” instead of “file:\\”! See this link: <http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/4/>

#### **Detecting valid folders in C drive:**

It was possible to find the valid folders on C drive by using the same technique as the error messages were a little bit different in case of having a valid or an invalid folder:

$target$ = \\localhost\windows\

$target$ = \\localhost\invalidfolder\

Try it in: <http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/6/> – in case of an invalid folder the message will be: “the system cannot locate the object …”. When a folder is valid we will have: “the system cannot find the path …”

I also found out if I use NTFS ADS (Alternate Data Streams) that are related to files and not the directories such as “::$DATA” I would receive different error messages to detect the valid folders (“access denied” versus the “the system cannot locate the object …”):

$target$ = \\localhost\windows::$DATA

$target$ = \\localhost\invalidfolder::$DATA

See the result in this link: <http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/7/>

#### **Detecting files and directories in all drives:**

At this point during my testing, I had a limitation and I could not detect my files in any drive other than the C drive by using the previous vectors. Vectors like “file:/e:/” or “\\localhost\e$” did not work.

I solved this problem by using “res://” protocol ([http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767740(v=vs.85).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767740%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx)) and I received different error messages by pointing to the files or folders.

$target$ = res://d:\validfile.txt

$target$ = res://d:\invalidfile.txt

See the results here (you need to create the “validfile.txt” file in your D drive or change the path): <http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/5/>

#### **Detecting available drives:**

In order to make the results more accurate, I had to find the available drive letters on the box. Unfortunately “res://” protocol was not helpful in this case and I had to use another solution. The solution that I found was in fact very easy. I could use the drive letters directly; if the drive letter is available, the error message would be “access denied” and when it is not available, the error message changes to “the system cannot find the path specified”:

$target$ = c:\

$target$ = invalid:\

See the results in <http://jsfiddle.net/ubqug/8/>

#### **Detecting available Windows internal network addresses or internal websites:**

During my tests, I realised that I can send http request to local sites or IP addresses, and I can point to network shares as well. In this case, it would give me an error immediately if the target was valid. However, it could take between 10 to 60 seconds to come back with an error when it could not receive a response from the target! I used this technique to detect valid local IP/Name addresses. However, as it does take a long time to identify an invalid target, it is not appropriate for scanning.

#### **Denial of Service:**

Like many other DTD parsers, XMLDOM object was also vulnerable to denial of service. I did not even try hard to find the issue and I used an example in the following link from MSDN Magazine:

<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335713.aspx>

#### **Summary:**

I have created a **PoC page** to test the above techniques in one page which can be found via: [http://0me.me/demo/IE/dtdTest.html](http://0me.me/demo/IE/dtdTest.html "PoC")

I also searched in Google and I found out that the general topic of these issues have been mentioned in the following link from Microsoft:

[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/ms754611(v=vs.85).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/ms754611%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx)

See the “Threats and Mitigation” section in the link above.

At the moment this issue is a client side issue and only works in IE. I published it as the impacts are low (limited information disclosure vulnerability) and you cannot read the file contents with the vectors that I have found (only worthless local DTD files are partially readable). However, this research can be very valuable to people who are looking for the new vectors in finding/exploiting XML vulnerabilities (for example in Java – I do not have time to test this at the moment) – obviously in legal and legitimate research/pentest projects ;)

**Once again, the PoC page is: [http://0me.me/demo/IE/dtdTest.html](http://0me.me/demo/IE/dtdTest.html "PoC")**

## Microsoft XMLDOM ActiveX control information disclosure vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#539289

Original Release Date: 2014-02-18 | Last Revised: 2014-02-18

---

### Overview

The Microsoft XMLDOM ActiveX control can be used to check for the presence of multiple resources, which can result in unintended information disclosure.

### Description

| [Microsoft.XMLDOM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa468547.aspx) is an ActiveX control that can run in Internet Explorer without requiring any prompting to the user. This object contains methods that can leak information about a computer system to the operator of a website. By looking at error codes provided by the XMLDOM ActiveX control, an attacker can check for the presence of local drive letters, directory names, files, as well as internal network addresses or websites. We have confirmed that this issue affects Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11 running on Microsoft Windows through version 8.1.  This vulnerability is [actively being used by exploit code in the wild](http://www.fireeye.com/blog/uncategorized/2014/02/operation-snowman-deputydog-actor-compromises-us-veterans-of-foreign-wars-website.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to test for the presence of computer resources that would otherwise be restricted. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
