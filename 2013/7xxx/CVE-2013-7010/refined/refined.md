Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7010:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a signedness issue in `sizeof()` comparisons within the `avcodec/dsputil.c` file of the libavcodec library. Specifically, the code was not correctly handling the conversion of the `sizeof` operator's return value (which is an unsigned type) to a signed integer type when used in comparisons, leading to integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:**  Incorrect type casting during `sizeof()` comparisons could result in an integer overflow.
- **Out-of-bounds Access:** This overflow could cause out-of-bounds memory access, leading to potentially writing or reading memory outside the allocated region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Out-of-bounds writes can corrupt memory, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the attacker gains sufficient control over what data gets written outside the bounds, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability resides in the `dsputil.c` file, which provides utility functions for decoding video. An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing crafted video input that manipulates internal variables in a way to trigger the incorrect comparisons and overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Media File:** An attacker needs to craft a malformed media file that exploits the signedness issue in the affected `dsputil.c` file.
- **File Processing:** The target must process this malicious media file using vulnerable software which uses the affected library.
