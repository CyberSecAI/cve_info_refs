The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in WordPress, but only the Information Leakage vulnerability relates to CVE-2013-7233 (PLACEHOLDER).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `/wp-admin/options.php` page discloses sensitive information from the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Leakage (WASC-13): Sensitive data, including keys, salts, logins, and passwords (such as `auth_key`, `auth_salt`, `logged_in_key`, `logged_in_salt`, `nonce_key`, `nonce_salt`, `mailserver_login`, `mailserver_pass`) are exposed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain sensitive information, including login credentials for the site's email account, which can be used to take over the site and potentially other sites where the same email account is used for password recovery.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to the vulnerable page `/wp-admin/options.php` if the attacker is already logged into the admin panel.
- XSS attack can be used to obtain the content of the page if the attacker is not logged in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For direct access: An attacker needs to be logged into the admin panel.
- For XSS: An attacker needs to inject malicious scripts into the website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The information leakage vulnerability affects WordPress 3.7.1 and previous versions, as well as WordPress 3.8.
- The email login/password leakage is also present in another admin panel page, as detailed in a previous advisory (http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Dec/135). This vulnerability was present in other locations within the admin panel, compounding the security issue.
- The advisory mentions that the mail server login and password are saved in the database in plain text, which further exacerbates the impact of this information leak.
