Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way the Bio Basespace SDK handles API keys when making HTTP requests. Specifically, it embeds the API key directly within a `curl` command executed via the shell.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the API key to the command line and process table. By passing the API key as a command-line argument, it becomes visible to other users on the same system through process monitoring tools.
*   **Impact:** A malicious actor or unauthorized user could gain access to the API key, potentially allowing them to access, modify, or exfiltrate data within the associated BaseSpace account.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is local to the system where the Ruby script is being executed.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to have access to the same system as the user running the vulnerable script and possess the ability to monitor the process table.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is located in the `put_call` method within `bio-basespace-sdk-0.1.7/lib/basespace/api/api_client.rb`:

```ruby
def put_call(resource_path, post_data, headers, trans_file)
  return %x(curl -H "x-access-token:#{@api_key}" -H "Content-MD5:#{headers['Content-MD5'].strip}" -T "#{trans_file}" -X PUT #{resource_path})
end
```

The `curl` command embeds the API key (`@api_key`) within the `-H` header option, making it visible in the process table.
