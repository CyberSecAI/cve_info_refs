| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1850105#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2020-06-23 14:40:09 UTC  ``` python-beaker is affected by Deserialization of untrusted data which could lead to Arbitrary code execution.  References:  <https://github.com/bbangert/beaker/issues/191> <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/05/14/11>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1850105#c1)  Michael Kaplan    2020-06-23 14:40:23 UTC  ``` Created python-beaker tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1850106](show_bug.cgi?id=1850106 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2013-7489 python-beaker: Deserialization of Untrusted Data which can lead to Arbitrary code execution [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1850105#c8)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-06-30 10:00:24 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1849014](show_bug.cgi?id=1849014 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - python-beaker: deserialization of untrusted data which could lead to arbitrary code execution") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1850105#c9)  Todd Cullum    2020-06-30 18:52:35 UTC  ``` Flaw summary: If an attacker is able to enter malicious payloads into the cache database (e.g. if they are on the network and have creds for the database), they could get remote code execution on the machine running Beaker due to deserialization of data from the cache database by Pickle.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1850105#c11)  Todd Cullum    2020-06-30 18:57:14 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Implementing proper access control on the Beaker cache database, to prevent unauthorized writes into the database, will mitigate exploitation of this flaw. This flaw also cannot be triggered if the Cache functionality of Beaker is not used. When using the Session feature of Beaker, use the signing functionality to verify the integrity of the data retrieved from the database before deserialization.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1850105#c13)  Todd Cullum    2020-07-01 04:52:32 UTC  ``` There is not yet a patch for this but the maintainer has suggested implementing signing of the cache data upon commit to the database to be verified upon retrieval.   ``` |  |

Subject: Python Beaker - Deserialization of Untrasted Data which can lead to
 Arbitrary code execution

Hello all,

python beaker is affected by Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502)
which could lead to Arbitrary code execution.

I believe it was initially pointed out the flaw on Session here:
<https://github.com/bbangert/beaker/issues/35>

Some improvements were made by adding a secret/HMAC but the Cache layer
still has the same flaw. I reported the flaw on cache level here:
<https://github.com/bbangert/beaker/issues/191>
I created a POC but didn't publish it on the ticket.

There is no CVE assigned to this.

This package exists on Fedora and Debian at least.

Should I take any extra action?

Best regards,
--

## Description

[![@matheusbrat](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/293885?v=4&size=48)](/matheusbrat)[matheusbrat](https://github.com/matheusbrat)opened [on May 14, 2020](https://github.com/bbangert/beaker/issues/191#issue-618431819)

Hello,

Beaker uses Pickle on Session and Cache. On Session at least it has support to secret/HMAC but on caching it doesn't which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

[#35](https://github.com/bbangert/beaker/issues/35)

Maybe it would be wise to expose data\_serializer in Cache too and maybe even allow a secret definition for caching and perhaps default to json serialization.

What do you think?
