Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-7489:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data using Python's `pickle` module within the `python-beaker` library, specifically in its caching mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the use of `pickle` to deserialize data from the cache database without proper integrity checks. `pickle` is known to be unsafe when used with untrusted data as it can execute arbitrary code upon deserialization.
- **Lack of Integrity Checks:** The cache layer in `python-beaker` did not implement any mechanism (such as signing or HMAC) to verify the integrity of the cached data before deserialization, making it vulnerable to manipulation.
- **Missing Secret/HMAC in Cache:** Unlike the Session functionality, the Cache feature lacked support for secret keys or HMAC, thus failing to prevent the injection of malicious payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the machine running the `python-beaker` library. This occurs when the application deserializes a malicious payload from the cache, causing the malicious code to run.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cache Database Manipulation:** An attacker who has write access to the cache database can inject a malicious `pickle` payload into the cache, which will be deserialized later when the application retrieves data from the cache.
- **Network Access:** Attackers on the same network with credentials to access the cache database are able to perform the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Write access to the cache database:** The attacker must be able to write to the database used by `python-beaker` for caching.
- **Network presence (in some cases):** If the cache database is accessed over a network, the attacker needs network access to this database and credentials to write to it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the caching mechanism in `python-beaker` deserializes data using `pickle` without verifying the data's integrity.
-  The maintainer of `python-beaker` has suggested implementing signing of the cache data upon commit to the database to verify it upon retrieval, as a potential mitigation, but no patch is available in the provided information.
- The issue was initially identified in the Session functionality which was later improved but the flaw was still present in the Cache functionality.
-  Mitigation involves implementing proper access controls on the Beaker cache database to prevent unauthorized writes, and avoiding the Cache functionality of Beaker if possible.
- When using the Session feature of Beaker, the signing functionality should be used to verify data integrity before deserialization
