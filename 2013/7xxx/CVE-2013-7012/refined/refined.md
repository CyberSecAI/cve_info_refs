Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7012:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content includes a commit message from FFmpeg's git repository, specifically:

```
avcodec/jpeg2000dec: Fixes out of array write in jpeg2000 decoding
Fixes Ticket3080
Found-by: ami_stuff
Signed-off-by: Michael Niedermayer <michaelni@gmx.at>
```
This directly relates to the CVE-2013-7012, as it addresses an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the JPEG2000 decoder of FFmpeg. The associated ticket number #3080 also confirms the connection.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect handling of image offsets within the JPEG2000 decoder. The commit message indicates "non zero image offsets are not supported". This suggests that the decoder was not properly handling cases where the image data was not starting at the beginning of the allocated buffer. Specifically, the code was not checking for and rejecting non-zero image offsets.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:** The decoder writes data outside of allocated memory boundaries when handling JPEG2000 files with non-zero image offsets.
- **Integer overflow:** There are indications of signedness issues in size calculations that can result in overflows when accessing arrays which can lead to out-of-bounds access.
- **Missing check:** The code was not validating image offset values, which resulted in memory corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the nature of out-of-bounds memory access, this could lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker could craft a malicious input that overwrites sensitive memory locations.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** At a minimum, an attacker could use a specially crafted JPEG2000 file to cause a crash (segmentation fault), resulting in a denial of service.
- **Memory Corruption:** The out of bound write could also lead to memory corruption and unexpected behavior.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted JPEG2000 files:** An attacker would need to create a specially crafted JPEG2000 file with specific image offset values, triggering the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide input to FFmpeg:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious JPEG2000 file to an application using FFmpeg. This could be done through various means such as:
    - Opening the file with FFmpeg via command line or API
    - Embedding it in a container file
    - Having a media processing software that utilizes the vulnerable codec process the file.

**Additional Notes:**
* The information provided includes commit messages, code diffs, and bug tracker entries, offering detailed insight into the vulnerability's cause and fix.
* The provided information confirms that the vulnerability exists in versions prior to the fix.
* The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description.

In summary, CVE-2013-7012 stems from improper handling of non-zero image offsets within FFmpeg's JPEG2000 decoder, leading to out-of-bounds memory writes and potential code execution. The attacker needs to provide a crafted JPEG2000 file to exploit this vulnerability.
