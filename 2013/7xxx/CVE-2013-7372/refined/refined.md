  "CVE-2013-7372": {
    "Information": "The provided documents discuss a vulnerability related to the improper initialization of the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in Android, particularly affecting applications using Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). This issue stems from the underlying OpenSSL PRNG not being properly seeded, which could lead to cryptographically weak random numbers.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the improper initialization of the OpenSSL PRNG used by Android's Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). The PRNG wasn't automatically seeded with sufficient entropy from a reliable source like `/dev/urandom` or `/dev/random`, leading to weak cryptographic key generation and random number generation in affected applications. Additionally, a bug in Apache Harmony's SecureRandom implementation caused seed overwriting, further limiting entropy.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper initialization of OpenSSL PRNG within the Android JCA.",
      "Lack of sufficient entropy during PRNG seeding.",
      "Bug in Apache Harmony's SecureRandom implementation causing seed overwriting.",
      "Fallback seeding mechanism in Apache Harmony using a weak random() function, further reducing entropy.",
        "Use of a predictable counter in the PRNG",
        "Limited state size in some PRNG implementations"

    ],
    "Impact": "The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the generation of cryptographically weak keys, making them vulnerable to theft or compromise. This could lead to the theft of Bitcoins and other sensitive data protected by these keys.  Furthermore, the predictable nature of the PRNG may allow for prediction of future outputs, and the limited entropy reduces the resistance to brute force attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Applications using the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) for key generation, signing, or random number generation.",
      "Applications directly invoking the system-provided OpenSSL PRNG without explicit initialization."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to target applications that are affected by the weak PRNG, which means any application using JCA APIs such as `SecureRandom`, `KeyGenerator`, `KeyPairGenerator`, `KeyAgreement`, and `Signature` without proper seeding on Android devices before KitKat. They must then be able to exploit the weak cryptographic material (e.g., private keys) to steal sensitive data."
