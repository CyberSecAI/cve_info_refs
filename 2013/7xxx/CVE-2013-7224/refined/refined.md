Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the application's default `to_json` method for models, specifically in the `User` model. This method was not properly sanitizing the output, causing sensitive user data to be included in JSON responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The default `to_json` method exposed sensitive information, such as password hashes, password salts, and other user details. This was happening when a logged-in user requests user data in JSON format (e.g., `/users/1.json`).
*   **Insecure Default:**  The application failed to implement a custom `to_json` method that would sanitize the output, leaving it vulnerable to information leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker, with valid user credentials, could retrieve sensitive data from other users. Specifically, they could obtain the password hashes and salts. Although the passwords themselves are not exposed directly, the leaked hash/salt pairs could be used in offline password cracking attempts, potentially leading to account compromise.
*   The leaked information could be used for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `/users/{id}.json` endpoint of the application.
*   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid account on the Fat Free CRM application.
*   The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the application.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The advisory mentions that the application was using Ruby on Rails, and there were multiple other vulnerabilities present besides this one.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by adding a custom `to_json` method in the user model that only outputs the user's name, preventing the exposure of sensitive data. Additionally a `to_xml` method is added for similar reasons.
*   The fix also includes preventing access to the `/users` index and delete routes.
*   The advisory also notes that `to_xml` could also have a similar vulnerability that could require its own CVE. This was later identified as CVE-2013-7249.

**Summary of Fix:**

The vulnerability was addressed by:

1.  Implementing custom `to_json` and `to_xml` methods in the `User` model that only output the user's name, preventing the exposure of sensitive data.
2.  Restricting the routes to the `/users` endpoint to prevent access to `index` and `delete` actions.
