Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7428:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an open proxy issue in the `plugin_googlemap2_proxy.php` file of the Googlemaps plugin for Joomla. The plugin fetches content from URLs provided in the `url` parameter without proper validation. This allows an attacker to use the vulnerable server as an open proxy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The plugin fetches the content from the given URL without any restrictions, allowing an attacker to cause a denial-of-service by providing URLs to large files, consuming server resources.
*   **Open Proxy:** The lack of restrictions on the `url` parameter makes the plugin act as an open proxy which can be abused for various malicious purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing the URL to a large file, an attacker can cause resource exhaustion on the server hosting the vulnerable Joomla plugin, potentially leading to service disruption.
*   **Abuse as Open Proxy:** The vulnerable server can be used as an open proxy to launch attacks against other systems, masking the attacker's true location and making it harder to track them.
*   **Network Resource abuse:** Vulnerable server could be made to fetch content from remote resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `url` parameter of the `plugin_googlemap2_proxy.php` file. An attacker crafts a URL containing the target they want to use the vulnerable server as a proxy for.
*   Automated attacks are possible via tools like DAVOSET.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable website and send requests to the `plugin_googlemap2_proxy.php` file.
*   No special privileges or credentials on the vulnerable server are required.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Googlemaps plugin for Joomla versions 2.x and 3.x, and potentially previous versions.
*   A related vulnerability, CVE-2014-9686, arises when the attacker controls a subdomain of the victim's domain name, which is considered a variant of CVE-2013-7428
*   The same vulnerability exists in the file  `plugin_googlemap3_proxy.php`, although it might have a different path on websites.
