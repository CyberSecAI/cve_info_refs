Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-7429:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Googlemaps plugin for Joomla's `plugin_googlemap2_proxy.php` (and potentially `plugin_googlemap3_proxy.php`) file not properly sanitizing or validating the URL parameter. This allows for the inclusion of external XML files via the `url` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to XML injection due to the lack of sanitization of the URL parameter which allows an attacker to include external XML files.
- **XSS via XML Injection**: By injecting a malicious XML file, the attacker can execute arbitrary javascript code (Cross-Site Scripting) within the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XML Injection:** The impact could range from denial of service (depending on the included file) to other unforeseen consequences.
- **XSS via XML Injection:**  Attackers can potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `url` parameter in the vulnerable proxy file (`plugin_googlemap2_proxy.php` and potentially `plugin_googlemap3_proxy.php`).
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL that points to an external XML file which is then included by the vulnerable plugin.
  - Example: `<http://site/plugins/content/plugin_googlemap2_proxy.php?url=site2/xml.xml>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious `url` parameter value.
- The attacker needs access to a publicly accessible server to host the malicious XML file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content mentions that the issue has been fixed in version 3.1 of the plugin.
- The CVE assignment notes that while XML injection could lead to a denial of service, that is a separate issue (CVE-2013-7428). CVE-2013-7429 is specifically for the XML injection vulnerability itself.
- The CVE assignment also notes that the XSS vulnerability caused by injecting malicious code into an XML document is being tracked under CVE-2013-7430 and is not included in the scope of CVE-2013-7429
- The content indicates that the plugin is vulnerable in versions 2.x and 3.x.
