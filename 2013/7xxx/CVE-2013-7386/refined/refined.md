Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7386:

**Root Cause:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the BOINC client when writing/dumping account information into an XML file. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of the 'gui_urls' item within the account file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Format string vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can provide a specially crafted account file with a malicious 'gui_urls' value. When processed by the BOINC client, this can lead to:
    - Client crash
    - Potential arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the BOINC client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves supplying a malicious account file to the BOINC client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted account file to the BOINC client. This likely implies the attacker has some control over, or is able to intercept or inject the file during the BOINC client's operation.
- No specific position is mentioned other than an attacker able to provide the malicious file, meaning no specific network position is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability affects BOINC client versions shipped with Fedora 17, 18, and Fedora EPEL-6.
- A patch has been provided by the upstream project, addressing the format string issue.
- The vulnerability was reported by Gianfranco Costamagna/Nicol√°s Alvarez, and later analyzed and confirmed by others.
