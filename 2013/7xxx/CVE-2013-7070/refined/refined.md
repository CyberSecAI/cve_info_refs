Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7070:

**CVE-2013-7070**: This CVE is related to insufficient sanitization of the `$target` and `$target_cgi` variables within the `lib/HTTPServer.pm` file of the Monitorix software.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `handle_request` function of `lib/HTTPServer.pm`. Specifically, the code did not adequately filter out potentially harmful characters in the `$target` and `$target_cgi` variables, which are derived from the requested URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input (the URL) before using it to construct file paths or execute CGI scripts.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution (related to go.cgi, but not the root cause for this CVE):** Although the description mentions a `go.cgi` exploit, this is a separate issue (CVE-2004-2776) and not the direct result of the input sanitization vulnerability covered by CVE-2013-7070.  The `go.cgi` vulnerability is only mentioned in the context of the vulnerability report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the `$target` variable to access files or directories outside the intended scope, which is not specifically detailed, but implied through the fix of sanitizing these variables.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), not covered by this CVE:** Although the initial report mentions XSS, this issue is assigned CVE-2013-7071 and is caused by a separate vulnerability in how PATH_INFO (the `$url` variable) is handled. This is also fixed by the described commit.
- **Session Fixation (not covered by a CVE):** The report also mentions "session fixation," but this was not considered an independent vulnerability and was not assigned a CVE.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending specifically crafted HTTP requests to the Monitorix server with malicious characters in the URL that would be used to construct the `$target` and `$target_cgi` variables.
- **Unauthenticated access:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Monitorix server.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials.

**Additional Notes**

- The fix involves using a regular expression `s/[^$OK_CHARS]/\_/go` to replace characters that are not in the allowed set `$OK_CHARS = '-a-zA-Z0-9\_./'` with underscores. This is applied to both `$target` and `$target_cgi` variables.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.3.1 of Monitorix, as indicated by the commit message.
- The provided documents also reference CVE-2013-7071 (for XSS via PATH_INFO), CVE-2013-7072 (for a separate unspecified security issue fixed in v3.4.0), and CVE-2004-2776 (for go.cgi exploit).
