Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7075:

**CVE-2013-7075**

*   **Vulnerability Type:** Insecure Unserialize
*   **Affected Versions:** TYPO3 versions 4.5.0 to 4.5.31, 4.7.0 to 4.7.16, 6.0.0 to 6.0.11, 6.1.0 to 6.1.6, and the development branch of 6.2.
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **CVSS v2.0:** AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing signature for an input parameter, allowing an attacker to unserialize arbitrary objects within TYPO3.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Insecure deserialization of user-controlled data.
    *   Lack of proper input validation or signature checking of serialized data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can potentially delete arbitrary files that are writable by the PHP server process.
    *   Possible modification of application data or behavior.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploitation occurs through crafted URL parameters containing malicious serialized data.
    *   The attacker needs a valid backend user login or must successfully execute a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated backend user or needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link (CSRF).

**Summary**
This CVE details an insecure unserialize vulnerability in TYPO3's content editing wizards, allowing an attacker with a backend login (or via CSRF) to potentially delete arbitrary files writable by the PHP process. The lack of signature validation on the serialized data enables the execution of arbitrary objects.
