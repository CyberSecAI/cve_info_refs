Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7446:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the AF\_UNIX implementation within the Linux kernel. Specifically, it lies in how the kernel handles wait queues related to AF\_UNIX sockets, particularly when a client socket is connected to a server socket and there is a full peer receive queue. The server socket could be freed while the client socket's epoll mechanism still has a pointer to the server socket's peer\_wait queue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core issue is that a wait queue (peer\_wait) belonging to a server socket can be accessed by a client even after the server socket has been freed. This happens because the client's polling mechanism (epoll) might still hold a pointer to this queue, but the server side has freed it.
*   **Lack of synchronization:** There is no mechanism to deregister a wait queue with epoll, resulting in a dangling pointer if a server socket closes while the client is still waiting on its peer queue.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a system crash by using crafted `epoll_ctl` calls that exploit the use-after-free vulnerability, leading to a system panic.
*  **Information Leak:** Some of the documents note that sensitive information might be exposed as a result of this vulnerability.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** There are some indications that privilege escalation might be possible, although this is not detailed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability. The primary vector involves crafting specific `epoll_ctl` calls.
*   **Crafted epoll\_ctl calls:** The attacker needs the ability to use epoll syscall and control the arguments in a specific way that causes a race condition and triggers the use-after-free scenario in `af_unix.c`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the local system.
*   The attacker must be able to call the epoll syscall (epoll\_ctl) with crafted arguments.

**Additional Details:**
* The fix for CVE-2013-7446 implemented in commit 7d267278a9ece963d77eefec61630223fce08c6c was to no longer call sock\_poll\_wait directly on the peer socket's wait queue. Instead, it uses a wait\_queue\_t on the client to handle the wake up relayed from the server.
* The original vulnerability appears to stem from a fix for a race condition in a previous commit ec0d215f9420 which aimed to fix a poll-for-write issue on connected datagram unix sockets. This shows that the fix was complex and that handling all possible side effects is difficult.
* The vulnerability allows a local user to bypass intended AF\_UNIX socket permissions, suggesting the ability to inject or receive data that should not be permitted.
*   Various documents mention that the vulnerability was discovered by Dmitry Vyukov.

In summary, CVE-2013-7446 describes a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's AF\_UNIX socket implementation which can be exploited locally through crafted `epoll_ctl` calls. This can result in a system crash or exposure of sensitive information. The fix involves significant changes to how the kernel manages wait queues for AF\_UNIX sockets, avoiding direct access to potentially freed resources.
