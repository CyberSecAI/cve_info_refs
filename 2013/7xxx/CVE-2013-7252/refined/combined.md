# KWallet Security Analysis

**KDE 4.12 comes with a KWallet GnuPG backend, which is more secure. More info [here](http://www.rusu.info/wp/?p=248), including how to move existing wallets.**

*(Note: Tom Leek has written a more detailed [analysis on StackExchange](http://security.stackexchange.com/a/44010/32167).)*

I started using [KWallet](http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdeutils/kwallet/introduction.html) a few months ago to stop [reusing same passwords](https://xkcd.com/792/) on multiple sites. Using [KDE Wallet plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kde-wallet-password-integratio/?src=search) for Firefox, I setup my passwords to be automatically stored in a KWallet file, which was the best solution I found for Firefox on Linux (other than Lastpass, but it stores passwords remotely and is closed source, which I donât prefer when dealing with passwords). But I needed access to my passwords on my Android device occasionally, so I started to work on a [Python script to read KWallet](https://github.com/gaganpreet/kwallet-dump) .kwl files. While I was writing the script, I discovered that KWallet has some implementation problems.

## About KWallet Code

The backend code for KWallet was written nearly a decade ago, from looking at the copyright notices on files. The source code for KWallet is available as part of KDE Runtime [here](https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kde-runtime/repository/revisions/master/show/kwalletd/backend). The backend code uses its own [Blowfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29) and [CBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29) implementation. KWalletâs Blowfish implementation doesnât match the OpenSSLâs Blowfish due to [wrong endianness](http://www.openwall.com/lists/john-dev/2012/07/29/6).

## The KWallet format

KWallet has a simple storage format, the data structures are stored in a serialized format using [QDataStream](https://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qdatastream.html), which is like JSON for C++/Qt. QDataStream provides a platform independent way to read and write to files, which is good since KDE runs on a variety of platforms. The serialized string generated by QDataStream is then encrypted with Blowfish in CBC mode with a key size depending on the size of the password used for the wallet given by the user.

## Where things go wrong

### Key generation

KWallet doesnât use the password input by the user to encrypt a wallet directly, instead it uses a key generation scheme. The key generation can be described as â break up user password into blocks of 16 characters each, and apply SHA1 2000 times on each of them. This is [key stretching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) without a salt. These blocks are then trimmed and concatenated to fit into 56 bytes, the maximum key length allowed by the Blowfish cipher. The problem here is that the user password is not salted, so for short passwords, itâs easy to compute [rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_tables) using the key generation sequence and crack multiple KWallet passwords.

### Mode of cipher

KWallet uses CBC, or to be accurate, it pretends to â the keysize used for CBC is the length of the string to be encrypted, which turns CBC into the less safe mode of cipher â [ECB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_.28ECB.29). ECB doesnât hide information well, for example (as on Wikipedia), an image of Tux encrypted with ECB will show patterns of the data that was encrypted:

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tux.jpg)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Tux_ecb.jpg)

Now, no one is going to store images in KWallet, which is when ECB is glaringly insecure, but any sort of repetitive data or reused passwords will show up in an analysis of a KWallet file.\_Â \_CBC and ECB mode both ensure confidentiality, but additionally CBC mode also adds randomness which ECB doesnât.

### Blocksize

Because KWallet effectively uses ECB, a block size of 8 would be very bad at hiding information. In most cases, thereâs not even 8 bytes of information in a block in KWallet. KWallet uses QDataStream, which encodes QString objects (used in KWallet maps) as UTF-16. So, the string âabcdâ will be stored as â*\0a\0b\0c\0d*â, which gives four bytes of information per block.

## Be safe

A replacement of KWallet, KSecretService has been due for a while. It even made it in release of KDE 4.8, but was removed due to a feature freeze in KDE libs. The replacement will be a part of KDE Frameworks 5, which is nearly a year away.

Unless Blowfish is broken, passwords in KWallet are safe â they just arenât using recommended cryptography protocols. That said, if you are really \*paranoid\* Iâd suggest the following safe practices for using KWallet to better hide information:

* Obviously, donât reuse passwords but with KWallet using ECB necessitates it more.
* Donât put KWallet files in version control
* Use a long password â the longer the password, lesser is KWallet susceptible to rainbow tables (or even brute force)

Huge thanks to the [Matasano Crypto challenges](http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/), I learnt a lot solving those challenges.

I reported this to security@kde.org on 2013-06-07, but I never heard back and later posted this on my blog. Thereâs a relatedÂ [CVE-2013-7252](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7252) for this security issue now.

KDE Project Security Advisory
=============================
Title: Fix kwalletd CBC encryption handling
Risk Rating: Low
CVE: CVE-2013-7252
Platforms: All
Versions: kwalletd < Applications 14.12.1, KF5::KWallet < 5.6.0
Author: Valentin Rusu
Date: 9 January 2015
Overview
========
Until KDE Applications 14.12.0, kwalletd incorrectly handled CBC encryption blocks when
encrypting secrets in kwl files. The secrets were still encrypted, but the
result binary data corresponded to an ECB encrypted block instead of CBC.
Impact
======
The ECB encryption algorithm, even if it'll scramble user data, it'll produce
same encrypted byte sequence for the same input text. As a result, attackers
may eventually find-out the encrypted text.
Solution
========
For kde-runtime KWallet upgrade to KDE Applications 14.12.1 or apply the following patch:
http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kde-runtime.git&a=commit&h=14a8232d0b5b1bc5e0ad922292c6b5a1c501165c
For KDE Frameworks 5 KWallet upgrade to 5.6.0 or apply the following patch:
http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kwallet.git&a=commit&h=6e588d795e6631c3c9d84d85fd3884a159b45849
Credits
=======
Thanks to Itay Duvdevani for finding the issue and for letting us know.
Thanks to Valentin Rusu for implementing the fix.

# kwalletd: Information disclosure — GLSA **201606-19**

Kwalletd password stores are vulnerable to codebook attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-apps/kwalletd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.14.3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.14.3-r2** |

### Background

Kwalletd is is a credentials management application for KDE.

### Description

Kwalletd in KWallet uses Blowfish with ECB mode instead of CBC mode when
encrypting the password store.

### Impact

Local attackers, with access to the password store, could conduct a
codebook attack in order to obtain confidential passwords.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All kwalletd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-apps/kwalletd-4.14.3-r1"

```

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

| [Description](#c0)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2014-01-02 14:40:30 UTC  ``` From ${URL}:  I just noticed this is now public:  <<http://gaganpreet.in/blog/2013/07/24/kwallet-security-analysis/>>  Short summary: kwallet uses Blowfish to encrypt its password store, and despite an attempt at implementing CBC mode (in a file called cbc.cc no less), it's actually ECB mode.  UTF-16 encoding combined with Blowfish's 64 bit block size means there are just four password characters per block.  Encryption is convergent as well.  This may enable recovery of passwords through codebook attacks. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Johannes Huber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2014-08-09 11:40:57 UTC  ``` Is this reported upstream? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Michael Palimaka (kensington)   gentoo-dev  2014-08-09 15:20:13 UTC  ``` I think upstream is vaguely aware, but there's no bug about it.  There's not much we can do - the code can't change otherwise it will break existing wallets. We could enable gpg support by default in kwalletd which offers better protection, but note that pulls in kdepimlibs too. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-01-09 11:46:39 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 536088](show_bug.cgi?id=536088 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - kde-base/kwalletd: CBC encryption handling") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-01-09 11:47:02 UTC  ``` For kde-runtime KWallet upgrade to KDE Applications 14.12.1 or apply the following patch:   <http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kde-runtime.git&a=commit&h=14a8232d0b5b1bc5e0ad922292c6b5a1c501165c>  For KDE Frameworks 5 KWallet upgrade to 5.6.0 or apply the following patch:   <http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kwallet.git&a=commit&h=6e588d795e6631c3c9d84d85fd3884a159b45849> ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Johannes Huber (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2015-01-20 21:11:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Agostino Sarubbo from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=496768#c4)) > For kde-runtime KWallet upgrade to KDE Applications 14.12.1 or apply the > following patch: >   > <http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kde-runtime>. > git&a=commit&h=14a8232d0b5b1bc5e0ad922292c6b5a1c501165c  + +  20 Jan 2015; Johannes Huber <johu@gentoo.org> +  +files/kwalletd-4.14.3-CVE-2013-7252.patch, +kwalletd-4.14.3-r1.ebuild: +  Revision bumps backports upstream patch to fix CVE-2013-7252, [bug #496768](show_bug.cgi?id=496768 "RESOLVED FIXED - <kde-base/kwalletd-4.14.3-r1: Insecure use of block cipher (CVE-2013-7252)"). +  > For KDE Frameworks 5 KWallet upgrade to 5.6.0 or apply the following patch: >   > <http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kwallet>. > git&a=commit&h=6e588d795e6631c3c9d84d85fd3884a159b45849  + +  09 Jan 2015; Manuel Rüger <mrueg@gentoo.org> +kwallet-5.6.0.ebuild, +  -kwallet-5.5.0.ebuild: +  Version bump. +  Arches please stabilize kde-base/kwalletd-4.14.3-r1 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-01-21 10:24:40 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Marios Andreopoulos    2015-01-25 18:03:22 UTC  ``` I upgraded yesterday and I can't access some of my wallets anymore. To be precise I have two wallets, one is always open and the other is always closed.  After the upgrade, the wallet that was open during the emerge opens only with the new kwalletd. The wallet that was closed during the emerge, opens only with the old kwalletd.  In order to fix the issue I downgraded kwalletd, exported my wallet and imported it in the new version.  Furthermore this fix seems half baked since I can't close anymore a wallet encrypted with GPG. I press the close button, the wallet seems closed but when I press open it opens without asking for a password. It only asks for my GPG password at the first time since login. Even worse maybe, the GPG dialog has the password visible. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Till Schäfer    2015-01-27 20:58:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marios Andreopoulos from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=496768#c7)) > I upgraded yesterday and I can't access some of my wallets anymore.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1048168#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-03 10:15:10 UTC  ``` It was found that kwallet, a tool for managing the passwords on a KDE system, uses Blowfish to encrypt its password store, and despite an attempt at implementing CBC mode (in a file called cbc.cc no less), it's actually ECB mode. UTF-16 encoding combined with Blowfish's 64 bit block size means there are just four password characters per block. Encryption is convergent as well.  The risk is that this may enable recovery of passwords through codebook attacks.

It seems that kwallet is moving to gpgme[1] from version 4.12.The current code is only bound to remain for backward compatibility purpose. So one solution is to update to 4.12 and discourage users to use blowfish for storing passwords.   [1] <http://www.rusu.info/wp/?p=248>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1048168#c5)  Huzaifa S.

Subject: kwallet crypto misuse

I just noticed this is now public:

<<http://gaganpreet.in/blog/2013/07/24/kwallet-security-analysis/>>

Short summary: kwallet uses Blowfish to encrypt its password store, and
despite an attempt at implementing CBC mode (in a file called cbc.cc no
less), it's actually ECB mode.  UTF-16 encoding combined with Blowfish's
64 bit block size means there are just four password characters per
block.  Encryption is convergent as well.  This may enable recovery of
passwords through codebook attacks.

Should we treat this as a minor vulnerability?
