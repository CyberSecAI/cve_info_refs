Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the TYPO3 Extension Manager. It occurs because the application fails to properly encode user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is that the Extension Manager does not properly sanitize user-provided input, making it possible for an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could trick an authenticated TYPO3 administrator into clicking a specially crafted URL.
- This would allow the injected JavaScript code to execute within the administrator's browser session, potentially enabling the attacker to perform actions with the administrator's privileges. This can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a forged URL crafted to inject malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Attacker Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs.
- **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking the forged URL. A social engineering attack would be required to get the admin to click the link.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the system or to be a valid user.

**Affected Versions:**
TYPO3 versions 4.5.0 to 4.5.31 and 4.7.0 to 4.7.16

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability requires administrator-level privileges, which limits the scope of potential exploitation if the attacker does not have a way to get access to an admin user.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Steffen MÃ¼ller.
- The issue was fixed in TYPO3 versions 4.5.32 and 4.7.17
