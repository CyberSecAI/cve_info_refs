| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2013-12-05 10:40:50 UTC  ``` It was found that in pam_userdb module for PAM, password hashes weren't compared case-sensitively, which could lead to acceptance of hashes for completely different passwords, which shouldn't be accepted.  After hashing the user's password with crypt(), pam_userdb compares the result to the stored hash case-insensitively with strncasecmp(), which should be avoided, as it could result in an increased possibility of a successful brute-force attack.  References: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=731368>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c1)  Ratul Gupta    2013-12-05 10:43:43 UTC  ```  Created pam tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1038557](show_bug.cgi?id=1038557 "CLOSED ERRATA - pam: password hashes aren't compared case-sensitively [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c2)  Ratul Gupta    2013-12-05 10:44:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 833081](attachment.cgi?id=833081&action=diff "Patch for this vulnerability.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=833081&action=edit "Patch for this vulnerability.") Patch for this vulnerability.  This patch was given at the debian page to solve this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c3)  Vincent Danen    2013-12-10 16:53:46 UTC  ``` Just as an FYI, Solar Designer made some additional observations about the probable unsuitability of continuing to ship this module.  It is probably worth looking into:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/12/09/7>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c4)  Tomas Mraz    2013-12-11 08:41:45 UTC  ``` Note that if pam_fail_delay module is used together with pam_userdb the timing information in case of failures is not really leaked as there would be additional random delay added. Of course to be sure on this we would have to properly statistically analyze the timing to find whether there still isn't some remaining timing leak not sufficiently masked by the random delay.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-16 20:41:09 UTC  ``` Upstream fix:  <https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/linux-pam.git/commit/?id=57a1e2b>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-19 21:03:56 UTC  ``` The versions of pam_userdb module shipped with the pam packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier only support crypt passwords using the traditional Unix DES based password hashing.  Support for newer hashes supported by underlying glibc crypt() was only added upstream via the following commit:  <https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/linux-pam.git/commit/?id=e2a8187>  DES based hashes consist of 13 characters out of the following set [a–zA–Z0–9./].  The first two characters are salt characters.  Remaining 11 characters are password hash.  This hash is base64 encoded output of 64 bit value from the DES encryption.  In the context of this flaw, salt characters are fixed - they are extracted from the hash value stored in the password database file and can not be influenced by an attacker trying a brute force attack.  Hence collisions happen when the hash of different password only differs in case of one or more alphabetical characters in the remaining 11 characters.  The maximum number of possible collisions depends on the number of alphabetical characters in those 11 bytes.  If all are alphabetical, there are 2048 (2^11) hashes with only different case.  As mentioned above, password hash is base64 encoded, hence there's only ~10% (52^11 / 64^11) probability that all 11 characters are lower or upper case letters.  For hashes with numbers or '/' and '.', the number of possible collisions is lower.  In DES based hashing, user password is used to generate 56 bit key for DES encryption (passwords are truncated to 8 characters, only 7 bits of each character is used to for the key).  Hence even though resulting hash is 64 bit value, there are only 2^56 valid hashes for a given salt value.  Out of all possible 11-characters strings containing characters listed above, only 1/256 of them are valid DES hashes.  Considering this, the expected number of valid collisions in the ideal case drops to 8 (2048/256).  Further on, some of these colliding hashes are likely to be for passwords that include special characters that are not typically used in passwords, or may not even be accepted as valid password characters by programs reading user passwords.  Assuming English keyboard, the number of characters to be used in password is less than 100 (this includes whole English alphabet, all numbers, and all punctuation/special characters).  Extending this character set to all 7 bit characters implies extending space of all possible passwords more than 7 times.  Hence even in the mentioned ideal case, it is expected that there is less than 1 colliding string that is a valid hash of a password that only contains characters typically used in passwords.  Even without considering any other optimization brute force attack is likely to use (such as trying likely / dictionary passwords first), benefits to the attack this flaw offers are negated by the increased password search space.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-19 21:05:19 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of pam as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 5. The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/> .   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c11)  Fedora Update System    2014-12-18 06:07:48 UTC  ``` pam-1.1.8-2.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1038555#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-06-16 15:04:00 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2013-7041>   ``` |  |

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [pam](/security/cves?package=pam) - Pluggable Authentication Modules

## Details

USN-2935-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PAM. The updates contained a packaging

change that prevented upgrades in certain multiarch environments. This

update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the PAM pam\_userdb module incorrectly used a

case-insensitive method when comparing hashed passwords. A local attacker

could possibly use this issue to make brute force attacks easier. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-7041](/security/CVE-2013-7041))

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the PAM pam\_timestamp module incorrectly

performed filtering. A local attacker could use this issue to create

arbitrary files, or possibly bypass authentication. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-2583](/security/CVE-2014-2583))

Sebastien Macke discovered that the PAM pam\_unix module incorrectly handled

large passwords. A local attacker could possibly use this issue in certain

environments to enumerate usernames or cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2015-3238](/security/CVE-2015-3238))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [libpam-modules](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam)
  -
  [1.1.8-3.1ubuntu3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam/1.1.8-3.1ubuntu3.2)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libpam-modules](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam)
  -
  [1.1.8-1ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam/1.1.8-1ubuntu2.2)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

  -
  [1.1.3-7ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam/1.1.3-7ubuntu2.2)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=731368;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]

```
Package: libpam-modules
Version: 1.1.3-7.1
Severity: normal
Tags: security, patch

After hashing the user's password with crypt(), pam_userdb compares the
result to the stored hash case-insensitively with strncasecmp(). Hashes
are case-sensitive and must be compared in this way. Comparing a hash
case-insensitively leads to accepting hashes for completely different
passwords which shouldn't be accepted. Traditional crypt() produces a
13-character string, and with each character allowed to be one of two
cases (roughly), the number of passwords that need to be tried in a
brute-force attack could be reduced by a factor of as much as 2^13 = 8192.

Additionally, using data.dsize as the length parameter for strncasecmp()
means that crypt() results that are longer than data.dsize but whose
first data.dsize characters are a match will pass, yet they shouldn't.
This problem is less important while pam_userdb supports only
traditional 13-character crypt() but it would become important if
bug#671740 were fixed, so it may as well be solved at the same time.

Sorry for not getting the nmu mail out in a timely manner, but real
life got in the way.

What is not acceptable is the assumed bad faith and the misguided
attempt at public shaming (after only half a day) without considering
the possibility of RL events or other benign possibilities.  A simple
"hey, what's going on with this thing I'm seeing in deferred" mail
directed at me would have been the kind thing to do.

The proposed patch is now attached.  I plan to upload that to
delayed/5 after about a week or so to give you lots of additional time
for review (way more than the normal nmu process requires).

Best wishes,
Mike

Use CVE-2013-7041.

Just for clarification, this refers to case sensitivity of password
hashes, not case sensitivity of cleartext passwords. It could
conceivably be legitimate for a product to process cleartext passwords
on Linux in a case-insensitive way (perhaps for compatibility with
another system on which passwords are supposed to be
case-insensitive). There doesn't seem to be any plausible reason for
supporting case-insensitivity of password hashes. A legitimate user
isn't going to try a password that hashes to one of the differently
cased values.

We also looked at other comments about this issue but did not assign
additional CVE IDs:

> From: Solar Designer <solar@...nwall.com>
> Message-ID: <20131209123945.GA16680@...nwall.com>

> a length comparison of the computed vs. stored hash should have been added

This seems to be a suggested security improvement to address the
possibility of a system that contained stored hashes with invalid
lengths. We would not consider this a vulnerability fix in the
traditional sense.

Again, there is a possible security improvement to address
computation-time information leaks that were not considered during the
product design. We would not consider this a vulnerability fix in the
traditional sense unless the product tried to prevent such leaks but
had an implementation error.

Subject: CVE request: pam: password hashes aren't compared case-sensitively

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1038555>

It was found that in pam_userdb module for Pam, password hashes weren't
compared case-sensitively, which could lead to acceptance of hashes for
completely different passwords, which shouldn't be accepted.

After hashing the user's password with crypt(), pam_userdb compares the
result to the stored hash case-insensitively with strncasecmp(), which
should be avoided, as it could result in an increased possibility of a
successful brute-force attack.

Can a CVE be assigned for this?

# USN-2935-1: PAM vulnerabilities

16 March 2016

Several security issues were fixed in PAM.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [pam](/security/cves?package=pam) - Pluggable Authentication Modules

## Details

It was discovered that the PAM pam\_userdb module incorrectly used a

case-insensitive method when comparing hashed passwords. A local attacker

could possibly use this issue to make brute force attacks easier. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-7041](/security/CVE-2013-7041))

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the PAM pam\_timestamp module incorrectly

performed filtering. A local attacker could use this issue to create

arbitrary files, or possibly bypass authentication. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-2583](/security/CVE-2014-2583))

Sebastien Macke discovered that the PAM pam\_unix module incorrectly handled

large passwords. A local attacker could possibly use this issue in certain

environments to enumerate usernames or cause a denial of service.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [pam](/security/cves?package=pam) - Pluggable Authentication Modules

## Details

USN-2935-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PAM. The updates contained a packaging

change that prevented upgrades in certain multiarch environments. USN-2935-2

intended to fix the problem but was incomplete for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. This

update fixes the problem in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the PAM pam\_userdb module incorrectly used a

case-insensitive method when comparing hashed passwords. A local attacker

could possibly use this issue to make brute force attacks easier. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-7041](/security/CVE-2013-7041))

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the PAM pam\_timestamp module incorrectly

performed filtering. A local attacker could use this issue to create

arbitrary files, or possibly bypass authentication. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-2583](/security/CVE-2014-2583))

Sebastien Macke discovered that the PAM pam\_unix module incorrectly handled

large passwords. A local attacker could possibly use this issue in certain

environments to enumerate usernames or cause a denial of service.
