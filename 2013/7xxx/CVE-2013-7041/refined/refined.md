Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7041:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `pam_userdb` module in PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) was using a case-insensitive comparison function (`strncasecmp()`) when comparing password hashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Case-Insensitive Hash Comparison:** Password hashes are case-sensitive by nature. Comparing them case-insensitively allows different passwords, which would produce different hashes with only case differences, to be accepted.
*  **Incorrect Length Check**: The use of `data.dsize` as the length parameter for `strncasecmp()` could lead to matches even when the compared strings have different lengths.  This issue is noted to be less important for traditional 13 character crypt hashes, but would be important if other hashing mechanisms were used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Increased Brute-Force Attack Possibility:** By accepting hashes with different casing, the attacker has a smaller set of possibilities to try when attempting to crack the password.  The size of the potential password space to brute force was reduced by up to a factor of 8192 (2^13) if all characters of the hash were letters.
*   **Potential Authentication Bypass:** Though not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that an attacker, by using case variations of a password, may be able to log in to a user account.
*   **Timing Information Leak**: A length comparison on the password hash, while critical to prevent some attacks, leaks timing information that could help an attacker determine if a tested password length was correct.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:**  As stated in the Ubuntu Security Notices (USN), a local attacker could take advantage of the vulnerability.
*   **Brute-force attack:** The vulnerability could lead to an easier path for brute-forcing user passwords, as fewer combinations would have to be tested.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker would need some form of access to the system where the vulnerable PAM module is being used, to attempt authentication.
*  **Password Hash Knowledge:** The attacker would need to know (or attempt to discover) a valid user password hash in order to attempt variations of capitalization.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the `pam_userdb` module, which uses a database for authentication, as opposed to system files like `/etc/passwd`.
*   The vulnerability was present in multiple distributions, including Debian and Ubuntu.
*   The issue was fixed by replacing `strncasecmp()` with a case-sensitive comparison, and by ensuring correct string length checks.
*   The `pam_fail_delay` module can mitigate some timing-based attacks, but a full mitigation requires an analysis of possible remaining timing leaks.
*   The Red Hat Security Response Team rated this vulnerability as having low security impact, citing the limited number of collisions expected in practice when using DES hashes, and the increased search space due to the possible use of special characters in passwords.
