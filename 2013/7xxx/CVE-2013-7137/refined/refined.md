Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient authentication when handling the `burden_user_rememberme` cookie. The application does not properly validate the value of this cookie, allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the `burden_user_rememberme` cookie.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By setting the cookie to a specific value ('1'), an unauthenticated user can gain administrative access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrative Access:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain full administrative privileges to the vulnerable application.
- **Complete Compromise:** This level of access could lead to further malicious activities like data theft, data manipulation, or complete system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the manipulation of the `burden_user_rememberme` cookie in an HTTP request.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Ability to modify cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to set a cookie value in the HTTP request. This can be done using browser plugins or custom tools.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.
- The vulnerable application is Burden version 1.8 and probably prior versions.
- The fix was implemented in Burden version 1.8.1, which removed the "remember me" functionality entirely.
- The advisory indicates that a simple HTTP GET request with the cookie set to `burden_user_rememberme=1` is enough to exploit the issue.
- The CVSSv2 base score is 7.5, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
