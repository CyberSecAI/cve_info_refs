Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7459:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `ALGobject` structure within the PyCrypto library when handling the Initialization Vector (IV) in certain modes of the AES encryption algorithm, specifically when an IV is provided with ECB or CTR modes, which do not use IV.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the IV parameter within the `AES.new()` function when used with the ECB or CTR modes. This results in a buffer overflow in heap memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the vulnerable application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial-of-service condition if exploited in a way that crashes the application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through an application that allows the mode of operation for AES encryption to be specified by an attacker, especially if the application uses ECB or CTR modes and is vulnerable.
*   Specifically, if an application uses `AES.new()` with the `MODE_ECB` or `MODE_CTR` mode, and also provides an IV parameter, it will be vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Control over AES mode:** The attacker needs to be able to control the mode of operation being used by the application.
*   **Ability to provide parameters:** The attacker needs the ability to provide an IV parameter to the `AES.new()` function in situations when it should not be provided.
*   **Remote or local:** Exploitation can potentially be done remotely or locally depending on the application's setup and interface.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `block_template.c` file within the PyCrypto library. Specifically, the `ALGnew` function doesn't properly validate or handle IV when used with ECB or CTR modes.
*   The fix involves throwing an exception when an IV is provided to the `AES.new` function when using ECB or CTR modes.
*   The patch was made in commit `8dbe0dc3eea5c689d4f76b37b93fe216cf1f00d4` of the PyCrypto repository.

**Summary of the provided content:**

The provided documents show:
*   A vulnerability in pycrypto's AES implementation where providing an IV with ECB or CTR modes leads to a heap buffer overflow
*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2013-7459
*   Multiple sources (Fedora, Gentoo, Red Hat) confirm the vulnerability and it's impact including arbitrary code execution
*   The fix was to throw an exception when an IV is improperly passed with ECB or CTR modes
*   The vulnerability is fixed in pycrypto commit `8dbe0dc3eea5c689d4f76b37b93fe216cf1f00d4`, but there is no new official release.

In summary, CVE-2013-7459 describes a heap buffer overflow vulnerability within the PyCrypto library, specifically when using AES in ECB or CTR mode with an IV, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
