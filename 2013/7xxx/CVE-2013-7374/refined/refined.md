Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7374:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Date and Time Indicator in Ubuntu incorrectly allowed the Evolution email client to be launched from the greeter screen (login screen). This was due to the date being clickable even when it shouldn't have been.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control: The date/time indicator allowed actions intended for a logged-in user to be performed at the greeter, where the user is not yet authenticated.
- Privilege escalation: The greeter user has limited privileges, but by launching Evolution, the attacker could potentially gain access to other applications with the greeter user's privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: An attacker could bypass the login screen and gain access to applications such as web browsers, with the privileges of the greeter user.
- Data exposure: If the greeter user had any data accessible without needing authentication, this could have been exposed to the attacker.
- System compromise: The attacker could use the applications to perform malicious actions with the privileges of the greeter user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to be physically present at the machine or have remote access to the login screen.
- UI interaction: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by clicking on the date in the datetime indicator at the login screen.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical or remote access to the system's login screen.
- Ability to interact with the Date and Time Indicator on the greeter screen by clicking on the date.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) and potentially other versions before the fix was applied.
- The fix involved disabling the clickability of the date when the indicator is displayed on the greeter screen.
- Patches were developed and merged into the `indicator-datetime` package, addressing the issue.
- The `indicator-datetime` package was updated in Ubuntu to prevent the launching of Evolution from the greeter.
