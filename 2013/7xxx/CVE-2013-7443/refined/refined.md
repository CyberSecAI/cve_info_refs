{
  "CVE-2013-7443": {
    "description": "SQLite 3.8.2 contained an array overrun in the skip-scan optimization leading to memory corruption. Fixed in 3.8.3.",
    "root_cause": "An array overrun vulnerability exists in the skip-scan optimization logic within SQLite version 3.8.2.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `WhereLoop.aLTerm[]` array was not properly resized when processing skip-scan optimization.",
      "Insufficient bounds checking on `WhereLoop.aLTerm[]` array"
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption leading to crashes, denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafted SQL queries that trigger the skip-scan optimization with a specific number of columns in the index. The vulnerability is triggered when the number of columns used in the skip-scan exceeds the allocated array size.",
   "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to execute SQL queries against a vulnerable SQLite instance.  This could be an application using the library or any interface that allows SQL query input."
