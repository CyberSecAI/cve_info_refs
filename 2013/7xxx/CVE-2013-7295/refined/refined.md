{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the Intel RDRAND instruction as the sole source of entropy for the PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator), discarding other entropy sources. This is triggered when OpenSSL is used with hardware acceleration on Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge Intel processors and no state file in the DataDirectory exists (first start).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cryptographically insecure PRNG due to discarding all other entropy sources besides RDRAND. This leads to predictable random number generation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Compromised cryptographic keys, especially relay or hidden service identity keys, can be generated due to the weak PRNG.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local, requires specific hardware and software configuration.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to exploit the fact that a user's Tor instance has been started in the vulnerable state with a misconfigured PRNG, which may allow prediction or compromise of the generated cryptographic keys."
