| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1065108#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-13 23:54:09 UTC  ``` A heap overflow vulnerability in PHP 5.5.0 and later was reported [1] in PHP's imagecrop() function.  In code that used the imagecrop() function to crop untrusted images, this vulnerability could cause a crash of the script or, possibly, the execution of arbitrary code as the user running the PHP script.  This has been corrected in PHP 5.5.9 [2].

Reported issues actually affect 2 components - php gd extension and libgd library, that is bundled with php.  Issues in the libgd may possibly affect standalone gd library.  There are two upstream commits:  - libgd part (linked in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1065108#c0)):  <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commitdiff;h=8f4a5373bb71590352fd934028d6dde5bc18530b>  This covers: [CVE-2013-7226](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7226), [CVE-2013-7327](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7327), [CVE-2013-7328](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7328)  Note that CVE description for these says "gdImageCrop function in ext/gd/gd.c", while it should be "gdImageCrop function in ext/gd/libgd/gd_crop.c".  - php gd extension part:  <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commitdiff;h=2938329ce19cb8c4197dec146c3ec887c6f61d01>  This is [CVE-2014-2020](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2020)   It can be argued if 3 separate ids were needed for libgd, but the split seems consistent with CVE content decisions where different flaw types imply split.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1065108#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 16:37:39 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1065108#c13)) > Issues in the libgd may possibly affect standalone gd library.  None of the issues actually affect upstream libgd 2.1.0, where gdImageCrop() is implemented as thin wrapper around gdImageCopy():  <https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/src/9f0a7e7/src/gd_crop.c#cl-21>  The gd versions as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and 6, and Fedora up to version 19 include gd 2.0.35 or earlier.  These versions do not implemented gdImageCrop() at all.  gdImageCrop() was added in libgd upstream via this commit:  <https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/commits/f67452e>  That version did not include proper NULL check and hence was affected by problems described in [CVE-2013-7327](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7327).  NULL check was added in this commit:  <https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/commits/02ae7c2>  Fedora 20 includes gd-2.1.0, which has the NULL check.  gdImageCopy() uses gdImageGetPixel() and gdImageSetPixel() internally, which already implement check (using gdImageBoundsSafeMacro()) to avoid out of bounds access and are not affected by [CVE-2013-7226](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7226) and [CVE-2013-7328](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7328).   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1065108#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 17:29:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1065108#c10)) > Name: [CVE-2014-2020](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2020) >  > ext/gd/gd.c in PHP 5.5.x before 5.5.9 does not check data types, which > might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by using > a (1) string or (2) array data type in place of a numeric data type, > as demonstrated by an imagecrop function call with a string for the x > dimension value, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2013-7226](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7226).  This looks more like a bug than a security flaw.  This can easily be triggered by script author, but with the removal of safe mode in PHP 5.4, it does not seem PHP attempts to provide protections against malicious script authors any more.  Leak or crash is likely to be triggered remotely if values from $_GET or $_POST are directly passed to imagecrop().  However, problem caused by that is unlikely to go unnoticed if a script doing so is tested.  Test case used in the upstream report has:  imagecrop($img, array("x" => "a", "y" => 0, "width" => 10, "height" => 10))  using string "a" as value for x in the crop rectangle.  However, even a string representing numeric value such as "0" triggers the crash.  Hence using $_GET['x'] would trigger crash with non-malicious x in the request, using e.g. intval($_GET['x']) was required.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1065108#c16)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 17:41:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1065108#c8)) > Name: [CVE-2013-7327](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7327) >  > The gdImageCrop function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP 5.5.x before 5.5.9 does > not check return values, which allows remote attackers to cause a > denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified > other impact via invalid imagecrop arguments that lead to use of a > NULL pointer as a return value, a different vulnerability than > [CVE-2013-7226](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7226).  Fix for this issue in incomplete.  It is still possible to trigger NULL pointer dereference using crop rectangle width and height values that cause integer overflow when multiplied.  gd detect that and gdImageCreate*() return NULL.  That return value is only checked after use (in gdImageSaveAlpha() / gdImagePaletteCopy()).  Reported upstream in: <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=66815>  Test case: imagecrop($img, array("x" => 0, "y" => 0, "width" => 65535, "height" => 65535));   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1065108#c17)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-03 19:45:33 UTC  ``` Statement CVE-2014-2020:  Not vulnerable.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [php5](/security/cves?package=php5) - HTML-embedded scripting language interpreter

## Details

Bernd Melchers discovered that PHP's embedded libmagic library incorrectly

handled indirect offset values. An attacker could use this issue to cause

PHP to consume resources or crash, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2014-1943](/security/CVE-2014-1943))

It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain values when using

the imagecrop function. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

PHP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2013-7226](/security/CVE-2013-7226), [CVE-2013-7327](/security/CVE-2013-7327), [CVE-2013-7328](/security/CVE-2013-7328), [CVE-2014-2020](/security/CVE-2014-2020))

One issue here is that there is no check of tmp's type nor a conversion. This means that if the dimensions array contains the key "x", its zval's value will be treated as an integer even if it's really a string or an array. This can be used as an information leak vulnerability, because strings and array contain pointers which can be used for subsequent exploits. See POC #1.  The "rect" variable is then used in a call to "gdImageCrop":  	im_crop = gdImageCrop(im, &rect);  This function then uses the user-supplied dimensions for various calculations:  	if (src->trueColor) { 		dst = gdImageCreateTrueColor(crop->width, crop->height); 		gdImageSaveAlpha(dst, 1); 	} else { 		dst = gdImageCreate(crop->width, crop->height); 		gdImagePaletteCopy(dst, src); 	} 	dst->transparent = src->transparent;  The gdImageCreateTrueColor() and gdImageCreate() functions are smart enough to block any attempt to overflow the width and height parameters, returning a NULL pointer when this happens. However, this code has an issue of not checking the return value of these functions, using the "dst" variable for memory writes unconditionally. This means it can cause a NULL pointer (or a close-to-NULL pointer) write, which is probably just crash the process, but since the gd image structure is very large, it could happen to even touch allocated memory. See POC #2.  The function then performs some bounds checks:  	if (src->sx < (crop->x + crop->width -1)) { 		crop->width = src->sx - crop->x + 1; 	} 	if (src->sy < (crop->y + crop->height -1)) { 		crop->height = src->sy - crop->y + 1; 	}  These are using signed integer arithmetics and can be overflown and tricked into incorrect calculations. Later, for true-color, the pixels are copied with this code:  	int y = crop->y; 	... 	unsigned int dst_y = 0; 	while (y < (crop->y + (crop->height - 1))) { 		/* TODO: replace 4 w/byte per channel||pitch once available */ 		memcpy(dst->tpixels[dst_y++], src->tpixels[y++] + crop->x, crop->width * 4); 	}  Remember that crop->x and crop->y are completely user-supplied values and we can supply negative values. This way we can force the copying code to read outside of the source image pixel data, causing a crash or an information leak. See POC #3.  We must however keep the crop->width and crop->height positive, and reasonable, because they are used at the beginning of the function to create a destination bitmap. We can however trick the already mentioned bounds checking code:   	if (src->sx < (crop->x + crop->width -1)) { 		crop->width = src->sx - crop->x + 1; 	}  When supplying a very large crop->x value, we can make the condition pass, assigning a value to crop->width which is larger than the real destination's pixel buffer width. The memcpy will then copy more data than the heap-based buffers can hold, causing a heap-based buffer overflow. See POC #4.  All the supplied POCs will cause a crash on 32-bit systems. First the POCs will segfault due to invalid memory read, the last one will crash due to a heap overflow (gdb output attached, but the backtrace is useless because the crash occurs much later, at PHP's shutdown and cleanup). Tested on a 32-bit Ubuntu Server machine. All versions of PHP containing the imagecrop() function are vulnerable, i.e. PHP 5.5.0 and newer. Proposed patch to fix the mentioned vulnerabilities is attached and it also adds a test for the POCs into the PHP test suite.   Test script: --------------- POC 1: ------  <? 	// POC #1 	$img = imagecreatetruecolor(10, 10); 	$img = imagecrop($img, array("x" => "a", "y" => 0, "width" => 10, "height" => 10));  POC 2: ------  <? 	// POC #2 	$img = imagecreatetruecolor(10, 10); 	$img = imagecrop($img, array("x" => 0, "y" => 0, "width" => -1, "height" => 10));  POC 3: ------  <? 	// POC #3 	$img = imagecreatetruecolor(10, 10); 	$img = imagecrop($img, array("x" => -20, "y" => -20, "width" => 10, "height" => 10));  POC 4: ------  <? 	// POC #4 	$img = imagecreatetruecolor(10, 10); 	$img = imagecrop($img, array("x" =>

``` Thanks for the detailed report!  As far as I remember it is fixed upstream (see Bitbucket repo).   I cannot read the patch yet but if not already fixed upstream it should be done on two parts:  . type checks and conversions in php's binding . bound check in libgd  I can check it on the 6 of January when I am back online (with laptop :)  Thanks again for your report!  ``` **[2013-12-27 06:15 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** -Status: Assigned +Status: Closed -Assigned To: pierre +Assigned To: laruence **[2013-12-27 06:15 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** ``` The fix for this bug has been committed.

I get a fix and committed. there are also one issue, that is , the arguments could be modified.. I fixed it in the mean time..   could you please review the commit?  thanks  ``` **[2013-12-27 11:17 UTC] kuba dot brecka at gmail dot com** ``` The fix at <https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/2938329ce19cb8c4197dec146c3ec887c6f61d01> only fixes the first POC I submitted. All the others, including the POC for heap overflow, still produce a crash.  ``` **[2013-12-27 19:58 UTC] [stas@php.net](//people.php.net/stas)** -Status: Closed +Status: Re-Opened **[2013-12-28 04:46 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** ``` where is the patch you mentioned? thanks :)  ``` **[2013-12-28 05:34 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** ``` The following patch has been added/updated:  Patch Name: bug66356.patch Revision:   1388208897 URL:        <https://bugs.php.net/patch-display.php?bug=66356&patch=bug66356.patch&revision=1388208897>  ``` **[2013-12-28 05:35 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** ``` I attached a patch for fixing rest POCs.  but I am not sure(not familiar with gd lib), whether we should also check if   dst->x + dst->width > src->sx?  thanks  ``` **[2013-12-28 07:27 UTC] [remi@php.net](//people.php.net/remi)** ``` Notice: libgd 2.1 is not affected by this issue.  gdImageCrop now use gdImageCopy which is protected by the use of gdImageBoundsSafeMacro.  Tested with php 5.5.7 + system libgd 2.1.0, all POC pass without any segfault.  ``` **[2013-12-28 08:13 UTC] [remi@php.net](//people.php.net/remi)** ``` The following patch has been added/updated:  Patch Name: libgd-v1.patch Revision:   1388218399 URL:        <https://bugs.php.net/patch-display.php?bug=66356&patch=libgd-v1.patch&revision=1388218399>  ``` **[2013-12-28 08:13 UTC] [remi@php.net](//people.php.net/remi)** ``` The following patch has been added/updated:  Patch Name: libgd-v2.patch Revision:   1388218414 URL:        <https://bugs.php.net/patch-display.php?bug=66356&patch=libgd-v2.patch&revision=1388218414>  ``` **[2013-12-28 08:20 UTC] [remi@php.net](//people.php.net/remi)** ``` 2 patches proposal (tested on php 5.5)  v1: position out of src image will return NULL.  v2: position out of the src image, will return a blank image, which is consistent with current size check: As the size check is done "after" image allocation, so, result image could be partially blank, but always of requested size.  We could also think of moving size check "before" allocation, but this will be a  BC break.  New size check seems better (even if the test is not really readable) and should be integer overflow free.  For PHP 5.6, I will prefer to see bundled libgd updated to upstream version 2.1.x  ``` **[2013-12-28 09:45 UTC] [pajoye@php.net](//people.php.net/pajoye)** ``` @remi Please sync with gd 2.1.x tree isntead, there are all bug fixes in it and no new features.  ``` **[2013-12-28 13:31 UTC] [remi@php.net](//people.php.net/remi)** -Status: Re-Opened +Status: Closed **[2013-12-28 13:31 UTC] [remi@php.net](//people.php.net/remi)** ``` The fix for this bug has been committed.
