# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHSA-2015:1551 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2015-08-05
Updated:
2015-08-05
# RHSA-2015:1551 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 roll up patch 5, which fixes
two security issues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works is the next-generation ESB and business
process automation infrastructure.

This roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Fuse
Service Works 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in the
README file included with the patch files.

The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

It was found that async-http-client would disable SSL/TLS certificate
verification under certain conditions, for example if HTTPS communication
also used client certificates. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could
use this flaw to spoof a valid certificate. (CVE-2013-7397)

It was found that async-http-client did not verify that the server hostname
matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName
field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker
to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any
domain name. (CVE-2013-7398)

All users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the
Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works installation (including its
databases, applications, configuration files, and so on).

Note that it is recommended to halt the Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works
server by stopping the JBoss Application Server process before installing
this update, and then after installing the update, restart the Red Hat
JBoss Fuse Service Works server by starting the JBoss Application
Server process.

Subject: Re: CVE Request: Multiple issues in com.ning:async-http-client

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> 1. async-http-client: SSL/TLS certificate verification disabled
> <https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/352>

Here, slandelle, representing the vendor, appears to mostly confirm
the original discovery (the "would stop working with self-signed
certificates" objection seems to have been dropped based on
clarification from the discoverer). The primary issue seems to be the
one mentioned in the
<https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/352#issuecomment-21795006>
comment -- specifically, the code's decision on whether to verify
server certificates depends on unusual circumstances that might occur,
for example, if HTTPS communication also uses client certificates.
This decision process apparently has no relationship to the design
objectives of the async-http-client product.

Use CVE-2013-7397 for this issue involving an unexpected/improper
decision process.

There is no CVE ID for the issue of whether the product should provide
a simple way to disable certificate verification, given that enabling
certificate verification is the default. The discoverer and vendor
disagree about this.

> 2. async-http-client: No SSL HostName verification
> <https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/197>

Here,
<https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/197#issuecomment-21760413>
mentions two closely related code problems. Better URLs for these are:

  <https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/blob/a12093438aa28e559c30cbbf1c7162f7d468fa2b/api/src/main/java/org/asynchttpclient/AsyncHttpClientConfigBean.java#L69>
  <https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/blob/ff2d6b3b6776f1c15dd0e94e8d630ebfd868a0b0/api/src/main/java/org/asynchttpclient/AsyncHttpClientConfig.java#L619>

Also, jfarcand, representing the vendor, did an
<https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/commit/3c9152e2c75f7e8b654beec40383748a14c6b51b>
merge for "Fix for #197 -- use a hostname verifier that does hostname
verification." Use CVE-2013-7398 for this issue.

# RHSA-2015:1176 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0, which fixes multiple security issues, several
bugs, and adds various enhancements, is now available from the Red Hat
Customer Portal.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0 is a minor product release that updates Red Hat
JBoss Fuse 6.1.0, and includes several bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to
the Release Notes document, available from the link in the References
section, for a list of changes.

## Description

Red Hat JBoss Fuse, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides a small-footprint,
flexible, open source enterprise service bus and integration platform.

The following security fixes are addressed in this release:

It was found that async-http-client would disable SSL/TLS certificate verification under certain conditions, for example if HTTPS communication also used client certificates. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could use this flaw to spoof a valid certificate. (CVE-2013-7397)

It was found that async-http-client did not verify that the server hostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2013-7398)

It was found that the ServerTrustManager in the Smack XMPP API did not
verify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains. A
man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof servers and obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2014-0363)

It was found that the ParseRoster component in the Smack XMPP API did not
verify the From attribute of a roster-query IQ stanza. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to spoof IQ responses. (CVE-2014-0364)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-6153 was incomplete: the code added to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using a specially crafted X.509 certificate. (CVE-2014-3577)

It was found that the JClouds scriptbuilder Statements class writes a temporary file to a predictable location. An attacker could use this flaw to access sensitive data, denial of service, or other attacks. (CVE-2014-4651)

It was found that SSLSocket in Smack did not perform hostname verification. An attacker could redirect traffic between an application and an XMPP server by providing a valid certificate for a domain under the attacker's control. (CVE-2014-5075)

It was found that JBoss Fuse would allow any user defined in the users.properties file to access the HawtIO console without having a valid admin role. This could allow a remote attacker to bypass intended authentication HawtIO console access restrictions. (CVE-2014-8175)

It was found that a prior countermeasure in Apache WSS4J for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption (CVE-2011-2487) threw an exception that permitted an attacker to determine the failure of the attempted attack, thereby leaving WSS4J vulnerable to the attack. The original flaw allowed a remote attacker to recover the entire plain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2015-0226)

It was found that Apache WSS4J permitted bypass of the requireSignedEncryptedDataElements configuration property via XML Signature wrapping attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a signed request. (CVE-2015-0227)

It was found that PKIX trust components allowed an X509 credential to be trusted if no trusted names were available for the entityID. An attacker could use a certificate issued by a shibmd:KeyAuthority trust anchor to impersonate an entity within the scope of that keyAuthority. (CVE-2015-1796)

The CVE-2014-8175 issue was reported by Jay Kumar SenSharma of Red Hat.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-11 10:47:44 UTC  ``` Apache WSS4J 1.6.5 contained a countermeasure for Bleichenbacher's attack on XML Encryption, where the PKCS#1 v1.5 Key Transport Algorithm is used to encrypt symmetric keys as part of WS-Security. In particular, the fix avoided leaking information on whether decryption failed when decrypting the encrypted key or decrypting the message data.  However, it is still possible to craft a message such that an attacker can tell where the decryption failure took place, and hence WSS4J is vulnerable to the original attack.   See here for more information on the original fix for WSS4J 1.6.5:  <http://cxf.apache.org/note-on-cve-2011-2487.html> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-2487>  This has been fixed in revision:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1621329>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-02-11 10:57:46 UTC  ```  Created wss4j tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1191455](show_bug.cgi?id=1191455 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2015-0227 CVE-2015-0226 wss4j: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-01 14:49:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4  Via RHSA-2015:0773 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0773.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-16 15:39:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.0  Via RHSA-2015:0849 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0849.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-16 16:30:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBEAP 6.4.z for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2015:0847 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0847.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-16 16:32:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBEAP 6.4.z for RHEL 5  Via RHSA-2015:0846 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0846.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-16 16:35:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    JBEAP 6.4.z for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2015:0848 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0848.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-06-23 16:52:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.2.0  Via RHSA-2015:1177 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1177.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-06-23 16:53:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.2.0  Via RHSA-2015:1176 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1176.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1191446#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-06-30 21:06:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1  Via RHSA-2016:1376 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016:1376](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016%3A1376)   ``` |  |

`AllowAllHostnameVerifier` is used if user does not explicitly set another `HostnameVerifier`.

I consider this to be a security issue and think this should be an opt-in setting instead. If there are any good reasons to do so, then default behavior should at least be clearly indicated in user guide.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2016-06-20

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in these Jenkins plugins:

* [Async Http Client Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/async-http-client)
* [Build Failure Analyzer](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-failure-analyzer)
* [Image Gallery Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/image-gallery)
* [TAP Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/tap)

## Description

### Path traversal vulnerability in TAP Plugin

**SECURITY-85 / CVE-2016-4986**

The plugin did not correctly filter a parameter and allowed reading arbitrary files on the file system.

### Path traversal vulnerability in Image Gallery Plugin

**SECURITY-278 / CVE-2016-4987**

The plugin did not correctly validate form fields and allowed listing arbitrary directories and reading arbitrary files on the file system.

### Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Build Failure Analyzer Plugin

**SECURITY-290 / CVE-2016-4988**

The plugin did not escape a parameter echoed on an HTML page, resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability.

### Async HTTP Client Plugin does not properly validate certificates

**SECURITY-305 / CVE-2013-7397 and CVE-2013-7398**

Async HTTP Client Plugin provides the Async HTTP Client Java library to other plugins. It is based on the 1.7.x line of AHC, which by default is vulnerable to [CVE-2013-7397](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7397) and [CVE-2013-7398](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7398), allowing man-in-the-middle attacks. The fixes for these vulnerabilities were backported. The system property `jenkins.plugins.asynchttpclient.AHC.acceptAnyCertificate` can temporarily be set to `true` to disable these new validity checks. [Learn more about system properties in Jenkins](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/).

## Severity

* SECURITY-85 is considered **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)**.
* SECURITY-278 is considered **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)**.
* SECURITY-290 is considered **[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)**.
* SECURITY-305 is considered:

  + **[medium](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7397)** (CVE-2013-7397)
  + **[medium](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7398)** (CVE-2013-7398).

## Affected versions

* Async Http Client Plugin up to and including version 1.7.24.
* Build Failure Analyzer Plugin up to and including version 1.15.0.
* Image Gallery Plugin up to and including version 1.3.
* TAP Plugin up to and including version 1.24.

## Fix

* Users of Async Http Client Plugin should update it to version 1.7.24.1.
* Users of Build Failure Analyzer Plugin should update it to version 1.16.0.
* Users of Image Gallery Plugin should update it to version 1.4.
* Users of TAP Plugin should update it to version 1.25.

These versions include fixes to the vulnerabilities described above. All prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.
