encounters a network problem while checking for an update, the
server now generates a “Failed To Get Response” error
message.

To resolve the issue that prevented an admin from viewing an
account when the admin’s hostname was not the same as the
account they were viewing, the viewmail function was changed
to be an admin extension.

A grantee to a shared Address Book can now sort for names by
letters.

Spell check does not timeout when checking a message.

Personal and shared contacts now display when users search
for an address from the To: field while composing an email.

Email messages and conversations can now be dragged and
dropped onto Zimlets.

Server side takes care of zimbraPublicServiceHost,
zimbraPublicServicePort, and zimbraPublicServiceProtocal
at the domain level. If the domain level of
zimbraPublicServiceHost is not set, they will look at the server
level attribute value.

Fixed issues that caused double booking of an appointment
when an appointment was edited in Calendar.

When a user’s auth token expires, they will be logged out of
ZWC. When they log back in, ZWC opens to their default log in
page. Any search or message tabs they had open are reset.

Zimbra Collaboration Server

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

• HTTPStoreManager is deprecated in 7.2 and EOL in 8. ZCS 8 will include a
new StoreManager SDK for integrations with third party storage solutions.

• Zimbra Instant Messaging (IM) capabilities are going to be removed in the
next major release of ZCS. These capabilities include the embedded IM

feature.

Upgrade Process

Download the latest ZCS 7.2.x and run the upgrade.

Before You Upgrade

The following might need to be done before you upgrade.

Zimbra Database Integrity Check

Some customers have had corrupted databases prior to upgrade, and the
upgrade has in some of those cases exacerbated the problem. In order to
detect any corrupted databases as early as possible, we have added an
optional step to check the MySQL database with zmdbintegrityreport prior to
making any system changes. You are prompted to decide if you would like to
run the zmdbintegrityreport.

The zmdbintegrityreport can take minutes to an hour to run, depending on
your system size and disk bandwidth.

Note:   The zmdbintegrityreport is run on a weekly basis from cron on all
zimbra-store nodes. Large sites can opt to disable this by setting
zmlocalconfig -e zmdbintegrityreport_disabled=TRUE. If you choose to
disable this, it is recommended that the integrity reports be run by hand during
the your normal maintenance windows and prior to running any ZCS
upgrades.

Preparing your OS

Before you upgrade ZCS, Zimbra recommends that the operating system is
updated with the latest patches that have been tested with ZCS.

Important:  If your OS is SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (SLES 11):

•

•

If you are using ZCS 7.2.0, SLES 11 SP1 is supported.

If you are using ZCS 7.2.1 or later, SLES 11 SP2 is supported as
described in Enhancements in 7.2.1 on page 2.

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

•

If you are using ZCS 7.2.5, SLES 11 SP3 is supported as described in
Enhancements in 7.2.5 on page 2.

Verify Certificates Expiration Date

ZCS 7.2.x requires a valid self-signed or commercial SSL certificate for
communication between some components. The self-signed certificates that
are automatically created by the ZCS install have a default expiration of 365
days.

If you have an ZCS installation that is over one year old and are using self-
signed certificates, your certificates will need to be updated either prior to the
upgrade or immediately following the upgrade.

After you upgrade, the following commands run as the zimbra user will
regenerate the self-signed SSL certificates:

• sudo zmcertmgr createca -new

• sudo zmcertmgr deployca

• sudo zmcertmgr deploycrt self -new

Upgrade Instructions

Go to www.zimbra.com Open Source Edition Download page for the latest
version of the software.

Important: Even though the upgrade process does not delete accounts on the
mailbox server, you should back up the mailbox server before you begin the
upgrade. After you upgrade, you should back up your server again.

When you run the install script, if ZCS is already installed, you will be asked if
you want to upgrade. Follow the instructions in this release note to perform the
upgrade. For additional information, refer to the installation guide.

Important: It is recommended that an install or upgrade session be run with a
UNIX command such as “screen” to help prevent an install or upgrade session
from terminating before it is completed. This is important when the upgrade
includes restoring a configuration that has a large number of accounts.

Example command usage: screen ./install.sh

Note:   You cannot revert to a previous ZCS release after you upgrade.

Single-Server Upgrade Steps

Read the release notes before you begin.

You do not need to stop the services before upgrading. The upgrade process
automatically stops and starts the services as required for the upgrade.

   Open Source Edition   7.2.6

Zimbra Collaboration Server

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

1. Log in as root to the Zimbra server and cd to the directory where the

Zimbra Collaboration Server Open Source Edition  archive tar file is saved
(cd /var/tmp). Type the following commands:

tar xzvf zcs.tgz, to unpack the file

cd [zcsversionfullname], to change to the correct directory

./install.sh, to begin the upgrade installation

The upgrade script begins by checking for an existing installation .

2. The Zimbra software agreement is displayed. Read this software license

agreement and type Y.

3. The installer checks for prerequisites. If any are missing, the upgrade

stops.

4. Next, Do you want to verify message store database integrity (Y) is

displayed. The default is Yes. This step runs zmdbintegrityreport to verify
that the MySQL database is not corrupt before upgrading to the latest ZCS.

The zmdbintegrityreport can take minutes to an hour to run, depending on
your system size and disk bandwidth. It is preferable that you run
zmdbintegrityreport at the time of the ZCS upgrade. If you choose to skip
this now, the zmdbintegrityreport will run during a regular scheduled interval
after the upgrade is finished.

5. When Do you wish to upgrade? [Y] is displayed, press Enter to continue.

The upgrade packages are unpacked.

6. The packages are listed. The installer also lists packages that are not

installed. If you want to install the packages at this time, type Y; otherwise
press Enter. The upgrade checks that there is enough space to perform the
upgrade. If there is not enough space, the upgrade stops.

7. When The system will be modified. Continue? [N] is displayed, type Y and
press Enter. The Zimbra server is stopped, and the older packages are
removed. The upgrade process verifies which version of ZCS is being run
and proceeds to upgrade the services, restores the existing configuration
files, and restarts the server. If you have a configuration with a large
number of accounts created, this can take a while.

8. If you have not set the time zone, you will be asked to set it. This sets the
time zone in the default COS. The time zone that should be entered is the
time zone that the majority of users in the COS will be located in.

9. When Configuration complete – press return to exit displays, press Enter.

The upgrade is complete.

3. The installer checks for prerequisites. If any are missing, the upgrade

stops.

4. When you upgrade the mail store server, the installer displays Do you want
to verify message store database integrity (Y) is displayed. The default is
Yes. This step runs zmdbintegrityreport to verify that the MySQL® database
is not corrupt before upgrading to the latest ZCS.

Running zmdbintegrityreport can take minutes to an hour to run, depending
on your system size and disk bandwidth. It is preferable that you run
zmdbintegrityreport at the time of the ZCS upgrade. If you choose to skip
this now, the zmdbintegrityreport will run during a regular scheduled interval
after the upgrade is finished.

When the mySQL software versions are changed during upgrades, the
underlying database tables need to be upgraded. The zmdbintegrityreport
does this automatically during it’s first run and will report the changes.
These are normal and should not cause alarm when upgrading.

5. When Do you wish to upgrade? [Y] is displayed, press Enter to continue.

The upgrade packages are unpacked.

6. The packages you want to install on the server should be marked Y. All

other packages should be marked N.

After the Upgrade is Complete

After you completed the upgrade to 7.2, the following bullet items may need to
be addressed.

•

•

•

If you upgrading from 6.X to to ZCS 7.0 or later, MySQL table upgrade is
required after upgrading. MySQL table upgrades are not automatically run
during the upgrade to 7.X, because of the time that it takes this process to
run. There is no known performance impact when running in production
without doing this MySQL table upgrade. Customers can avoid these errors
in the zmdbintegrityreport output by executing /opt/zimbra/libexec/scripts/
migrate20100913-Mysql51.pl.
(Bug 24329, 50557)

Applying the Mysql51.pl script requires all Zimbra services except
mysql.server to be stopped.

This script should be executed on all the mailstore servers where the
mailboxd process is running. For a 4000 mailbox, 250 MB mailbox size, the
script could take about 70 minutes to run. Customers should schedule their
maintenance window accordingly.

To run the script:

1. Switch to zimbra user.

su - zimbra

2. Stop mailboxd services to avoid email communications that might cause
an interruption.

zmmailboxdctl stop

3. Execute the perl script to upgrade the database tables.

/opt/zimbra/libexec/scripts/migrate20100913-Mysql51.pl

4. Start the mailboxd service.

zmmailboxdctl start

If your self-signed SSL certificates have expired, update them. See Verify
Certificates Expiration Date on page 10.

Third-party issue. iPhone calendar may not sync correctly when declining
or accepting an appointment in ZWC after the appointment has already
been accepted/declined from iPhone.

The Undo Send Zimlet might cause messages to be sent with no content in
the body. To avoid this, disable the Zimlet.

The ability to completely disable SSL Renegotiation might be desirable for
some environments, but due to the performance degradation it is not
optimal to use as a default setting.

The SslSelectChannelConnector can be forced to disable client renegotiate
requests via the "allowRenegotiate" attribute, for said connector, in
jetty.xml.in/jetty.xml.

The default setting is allowRenegotiate=TRUE. Explicitly setting to
"FALSE" will configure ZCS to always disallow SSL renegotiation for the
SSL connector in question. A mailboxd restart is required for this change.

Major New Feature Enhancements for 8.0

Zimbra Web Client Serenity User Experience

 Streamlined User Interface. The user interface has been completely

redesigned with simplicity and ease of use being the key improvements.
The Zimbra 8 interface is more streamlined so that common actions are
easily discoverable and highly intuitive to use.

Zimbra Collaboration Server

Open Source Edition 8.0.6 1

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

 Conversation View. In Zimbra 8 email is presented to users in a “natural”

conversation view that makes reading and replying to messages
convenient and intuitive. Quoted text is hidden and messages are laid out
in a way that is easy for users to understand the “in-reply-to” relationship
between different messages in the same email thread. Discreet links to
Reply, Forward and More Actions (presented just below the email) let users
respond to messages quickly and efficiently.

 Rich Composition. Improved composition editor allows users to craft rich

text emails, with features such as paste-style support from desktop
applications and the ability to include inline images bring the power of
desktop word processors to email.

 Shared Tagging. In Zimbra 8 tagging functionality has been improved so
that when items are shared users cannot only use tags to organize their
data but also share these tags across applications as well as mailboxes.

Activity Stream

Activity Stream allows users extensive control over the messages that go to
their Inbox. Activity Stream is intended for low priority mail that the user will get
to at a later time. Users can easily set up activity stream filters that direct
incoming messages to various folders (or are deleted from) based on different
criteria that they can specify. For example, emails to distribution lists, feed and
notifications that are not directly addressed to the user can be archived in
folders that can be read when convenient.

“Graymail” filtering prevents user’s Inbox from being cluttered by legitimate but
unwanted emails.

Dedicated Search Tab

A dedicated search tab is created whenever a user enters a new query in the
header search box. This allows users to perform a search, navigate away from
the search tab to perform another action such as compose an email, or
schedule an event and then come back to the search tab to continue with the
query.

Zimbra 8 provides users with a simple yet powerful search interface allowing
users to perform simple actions such as quickly filter on common attributes or
perform complex search queries making use of complex logical operators.

Enterprise Calendaring

Zimbra 8 provides an intuitive and sophisticated enterprise calendaring
system that enables users to manage multiple calendars and provides support
for advanced scheduling activities.

 Experience improvements to time and resource suggestions. Zimbra 8 has

significantly improved the user’s experience when working with the
appointment scheduling feature. Once users select attendees, Zimbra 8
can compare calendar availability and provide users with a list of suggested

 2  Open Source Edition 8.0.6

Zimbra Collaboration Server

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

meeting times. Similarly, based on meeting requirements such as the size
of the room and location, Zimbra’s scheduler can provide users with a list of
conference facilities that fit meeting requirements.

 Merge and split views of “Day” view gives users the flexibility to view their
different calendars (e.g. personal and work-related) either individually or
overlaid on top of each other. (In other words, see a “merged” view of
appointments from several different calendars in one calendar.)

Description

In ZCS 8.0, IPv6 is a beta release. IPv6 option can be configured
during ZCS installation.

The default is to use IPv4, unless IPv6 is configured.

The expected way to change IP mode is by changing
zimbraIPMode first, and then running libexec/zmiptool tool, e.g.:
$ zmprov ms `zmhostname` zimbraIPMode ipv4 ; libexec/
zmiptool ; zmcontrol restart
$ ps aux | grep java | grep preferIPv4Stack | wc -l
3
$ zmprov ms `zmhostname` zimbraIPMode both ; libexec/
zmiptool ; zmcontrol restart
$ ps aux | grep java | grep preferIPv4Stack | wc -l
0

Provide warning message when -l options is specified or if running
the command on a non-mailbox server.

Shared items can be tagged and the tags displays in the shared
users’ lists as well.

Users can set their account preferences to delegate authority to
another user to send messages as if came from them (Send As)
or send messages on behalf of the user. When a delegated user
composes a message for the user, they select the user’s name in
the From address drop-down menu.

In the advanced client, added printing options to Calendar.

Ability to configure antispam settings to bypass messages
originating from internal ZWC users.

Zimlets can now make GET, POST, PUT AND DELETE HTTP
requests via the proxy.

Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true is added by default. It is removed
if configured ZCS for use with IPv6 networks

Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true is added if both IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses are configured on the system

stating that the source server version does not support the
zmmboxmove command.

• A -force option is provided at the command line. The force

option overrides the source server version check and offers a
warning message at the command line stating not all data
may be copied from the source to the destination mailbox.

ZCO. Outlook's Work Offline option is now fully supported.

OL2003/7: File->Work Offline

OL2010: Send/Receive ribbon-> Work Offline

Work Offline can be used in conjunction with Send/Receive
Groups to control when connections are made to the server, and
when syncs are done. This is useful for connections that are
bandwidth/cost-sensitive.

Autocomplete matches now work correctly for Contact Groups.

zmprov. Introduced a new CLI option -r. Using this allows
replacement of multi-valued attribute value. If -r is not specified,
and neither +/- is provided, than the command fails.

The Zimbra user objectClass has been changed to
inetOrgPerson starting with ZCS 8.0. When you provision new
members starting with ZCS 8.0, the object class will be
inet.OrgPerson. When you upgrade from ZCS 8.0 to 8.0.x, user
data will be updated to reflect this change.

The Reading Pane displays on the right by default.

Changed the CA time period from 365d to 1825d (5 years).

Default hard coded time out for self-signed certificates is now
set to five years (1825 days).

The Zimbra Assistant feature is no longer available in the Zimbra
Web Client

When you upgrade to ZCS 8.0, the value for
zimbraPrefGalAutoCompleteEnabled in the default COS is
changed from FALSE to TRUE.

The value for zimbraPrefGalAutoCompleteEnabled in other
cos's are not changed.

The default value of zimbraPrefGalAutoCompleteEnabled in
newly created COS's will be TRUE.

Now if dynamic lists are used, the default is to allow lists of up to
10,000 members.  This can be controlled via the localconfig key
postfix_virtual_alias_expansion_limit.

During the initial installation of ZCS, a GAL sync account is
automatically created for the default domain.

Show selection checkbox for selecting email, contract, voicemail
items in a list view is now disabled by default. Users will have to
go to Preferences>General and select Settings to display
checkboxes.

If the zimbra-mta service is installed, Swatch will use it for
delivering messages. If it is not installed, Swatch will attempt to
use the system sendmail binary for delivering messages.

On multi-node servers that do not have zimbra-mta installed, it is
necessary to ensure that there is a system sendmail binary that
is correctly configured to deliver email if administrators expect
swatch notifications to work.

Created generic protocol throttle for POP3 and IMAP4 servers.
The throttle will limit requests/second from a given IP and from a
given account ID. The limit is enforced per-protocol; i.e. requests
from POP and IMAP clients are handled separately.

The limits are configurable in LC, with the following keys and
default values:

imap_throttle_ip_limit - default 250

imap_throttle_acct_limit - default 250

imap_throttle_command_limit - default 25

pop3_throttle_ip_limit - default 200

pop3_throttle_acct_limit - default 200

When a domain is deleted, ZCS now deletes all its alias
domains (i.e. alias domains with zimbraDomainAliasTargetId
pointing to the domain being deleted.)

On upgrade the ZCS installer automatically renames the existing
admin extension com_zimbra_smime to
com_zimbra_smime_cert_admin to avoid naming conflicts
with the new com_zimbra_smime end user client Zimlet.

Implement throttle for requests from an IP for LMTP service. By
default, no throttling applied because the requests mostly come
from internal MTAs.

To enable, throttling for LMTP service add the hostname/IP of
MTA to zimbraThrottleSafeHosts and set the LC key
lmtp_throttle_ip_limit.

Customers currently on ZCS 7.x upgrading to latest version of
ZCS will require full re-indexing mailboxes for sort-by recipients
feature to work properly.

Without full re-indexing the mailbox, sorting by "To" field in the
"Sent" folder message view will skip all the messages from the
sorted results added before the upgrade.

Note: re-indexing mailbox is an expensive operation and if this
feature is NOT so required then, its NOT recommended to do
mailbox re-indexing.

LDAP based GALsync performance improvements.

In 7.x and earlier releases, the server side logging controlled in
log4j.properties was automatically scanned and reloaded even
when the server is running.

In 8.0 it is now necessary to invoke zmprov rlog from the
command line in order to cause log4j.properties to be reloaded
while server is running.

Index data for mailboxes is never deleted so a mailbox index
can become very large over time and might be consuming
excess disk space because of the large index data.

In 8.0, a new zmprov CLI, compactIndexMailbox (cim) was
created to compact index data. This command can be used to
reclaim disk space when the index volume starts to become full.

To compact a mailbox’s index, type
zmprov cim <name@domain|id> start
Note: Depending on the size of the mailbox and the number of
deletes this might take awhile. This might require additional free
space on the index directory.

You can run this command concurrently. It is recommended to
run this command during off peak hours. You cannot cancel the
command once it is started.

To see the status of index compaction on a mailbox, type
zmprov getIndexStats <name@domain|id>

software and run the upgrade.

Note:   Database reloads are performed on 7.x to any 8.x upgrade.

Before You Upgrade

The following might need to be done before you upgrade.

Zimbra Database Integrity Check

Some customers have had corrupted databases prior to upgrade, and the
upgrade has in some of those cases exacerbated the problem. In order to
detect any corrupted databases as early as possible, we have added an

 Zimbra Collaboration Server

 Open Source Edition 8.0.6   21

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

optional step to check the MySQL database with zmdbintegrityreport prior to
making any system changes. You are prompted to decide if you would like to
run the zmdbintegrityreport.

The zmdbintegrityreport can take minutes to an hour to run, depending on
your system size and disk bandwidth.

Note:   The zmdbintegrityreport is run on a weekly basis from cron on all
zimbra-store nodes. Large sites can opt to disable this by setting
zmlocalconfig -e zmdbintegrityreport_disabled=TRUE. If you choose to
disable this, it is recommended that the integrity reports be run by hand
during the your normal maintenance windows and prior to running any
ZCS upgrades.

Preparing Your OS

Before you upgrade ZCS, Zimbra recommends that the operating system is
updated with the latest patches that have been tested with ZCS.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OS

Beginning with ZCS 8.0, only Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (64) is supported. If
you are running an earlier version of RHEL, make sure you install this OS
before upgrading to ZCS 8.0.

SLES 11 OS only

If your OS is SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11, we recommend you have SP3
installed (SP3 is required for 8.0.5 and later). (Bug 83032, 83676)

Verify Certificates Expiration Date

ZCS 8.0.x requires a valid self-signed or commercial SSL certificate for
communication between some components. The self-signed certificates that
are automatically created by the ZCS install have a default expiration in ZCS
7.2 or earlier of 365 days, beginning with ZCS 8.0 default expiration is 1825
days (5 years).

If you have an ZCS installation that is over one year old and are using self-
signed certificates, your certificates will need to be updated either prior to the
upgrade or immediately following the upgrade.

After you upgrade, the following commands run as the zimbra user will
regenerate the self-signed SSL certificates:

 sudo zmcertmgr createca -new

 sudo zmcertmgr deployca

 sudo zmcertmgr deploycrt self -new

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

Upgrading LDAP Replica Servers or Multi-Master Server from ZCS
8.0.0, 8.0.1, 8.0.2 to ZCS 8.0.4 and later

If you have replica servers or are in multi-master mode, you have to install the
Zimbra LDAP schema specific to the release you are upgrading to onto the
replica servers or onto the multi-master server before you upgrade to ZCS
8.0.4 and later. (Bug 81048)

1. On the master LDAP server, perform a software installation only of ZCS

8.0.4 or later.

./install.sh -s

2.   On each replica or additional master LDAP server in MMR mode, as

zimbra user:

a. Stop the server:

ldap stop or zmcontrol stop

b. Move the zimbra schema out of the way

cd /opt/zimbra/data/ldap/config/cn=config/cn=schema

mv cn={4}zimbra.ldif /opt/zimbra/data/ldap/cn={4}zimbra.ldif.dead

c. Copy the schema from the master LDAP server.

scp root@<master>:/opt/zimbra/openldap/etc/openldap/schema/zimbra.ldif
cn={4}zimbra.ldif

d. Edit cn={4}zimbra.ldif to change the following two lines:

dn: cn=zimbra,cn=schema,cn=config

------->     dn: cn={4}zimbra

------->     cn: {4}zimbra

cn: zimbra

e. Start the server:

ldap start or zmcontrol start

3.   On the master LDAP server run:

/opt/zimbra/libexec/zmsetup.pl

4.   On each replica server run:

./install.sh

To continue the upgrade, see Multi-Server Environment Upgrade Steps  on
page 25.

Update Default Proxy SSL Ciphers Attribute

Insecure SSL ciphers have been removed from the default proxy
configuration. Existing sites are recommended to review their enabled ciphers
and set zimbraReverseProxySSLCiphers to
RC4:HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!kEDH:!AD:!SSLv2 for maximum security.

 Zimbra Collaboration Server

 Open Source Edition 8.0.6   23

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

Note:   Some clients might need to be reconfigured if they were previously

using a cipher which is now disabled. (Bug 80133)

If you use Zimbra Clustering

Zimbra Clustering is no longer available for ZCS 8.0. VMware provides
integrated high availability between Zimbra and VMware
HA for automated recovery of critical Zimbra application services and server
components in the event of an application or infrastructure failure. Third party
solutions such as network load balancers, storage mirroring, or OS clustering
solutions like Red Hat Cluster Suite may be used in your deployment, but are
not specifically tested or certified by VMware. (Bug75821)

Upgrade Instructions

Go to www.zimbra.com Open Source Edition Download page for the latest
version of the software.

Important: Even though the upgrade process does not delete accounts on the
mailbox server, you should back up the mailbox server before you begin the
upgrade. After you upgrade, you should back up your server again.

When you run the install script, if ZCS is already installed, you will be asked if
you want to upgrade. Follow the instructions in this release note to perform the
upgrade. For additional information, refer to the installation guide.

Important: Zimbra recommends that an install or upgrade session be run with
a UNIX command such as “screen” to help prevent an install or upgrade
session from terminating before it is completed. This is important when the
upgrade includes restoring a configuration that has a large number of
accounts.

Example command usage: screen ./install.sh

Note:   You cannot revert to a previous ZCS release after you upgrade.

Single-Server Upgrade Steps

Read the release notes before you begin.

You do not need to stop the services before upgrading. The upgrade process
automatically stops and starts the services as required for the upgrade.

Process

1. Log in as root to the Zimbra server and cd to the directory where the ZCS
Open Source Edition 8.0.6 archive tar file is saved (cd /var/tmp). Type the
following commands:

tar xzvf zcs.tgz, to unpack the file

cd [zcsversionfullname], to change to the correct directory

 24  Open Source Edition 8.0.6

Zimbra Collaboration Server

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

./install.sh, to begin the upgrade installation

The upgrade script begins by checking for an existing installation .

2.   The Zimbra software agreement is displayed. Read this software license

agreement and type Y.

3.   The installer checks for prerequisites. If any are missing, the upgrade

stops. Next, Do you want to verify message store database integrity (Y) is
displayed. The default is Yes. This step runs zmdbintegrityreport to verify
that the MySQL database is not corrupt before upgrading to the latest
ZCS.

The zmdbintegrityreport can take minutes to an hour to run, depending on
your system size and disk bandwidth. It is preferable that you run
zmdbintegrityreport at the time of the ZCS upgrade. If you choose to skip
this now, the zmdbintegrityreport will run during a regular scheduled
interval after the upgrade is finished.

4.   When Do you wish to upgrade? [Y] is displayed, press Enter to continue.

The upgrade packages are unpacked.

5.   The packages are listed. The installer also lists packages that are not

installed. If you want to install the packages at this time, type Y; otherwise
press Enter. The upgrade checks that there is enough space to perform
the upgrade. If there is not enough space, the upgrade stops.

6.   When The system will be modified. Continue? [N] is displayed, type Y and
press Enter. The Zimbra server is stopped, and the older packages are
removed. The upgrade process verifies which version of ZCS is being run
and proceeds to upgrade the services, restores the existing configuration
files, and restarts the server. If you have a configuration with a large
number of accounts created, this can take a while.

7.   If you have not set the time zone, you will be asked to set it. This sets the
time zone in the default COS. The time zone that should be entered is the
time zone that the majority of users in the COS will be located in.

8.   When Configuration complete – press return to exit displays, press Enter.

The upgrade is complete.

Multi-Server Environment Upgrade Steps

Upgrade the servers in the following order. Update each server one at a time.

 LDAP master server. The LDAP master server must be running as you

upgrade the other servers.

 LDAP replicas

 MTA servers

 Proxy servers

 Mail store servers

 Zimbra Collaboration Server

 Open Source Edition 8.0.6   25

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

IMPORTANT: Certificates. If self-signed certificates are used, after the LDAP
master is upgraded, the self-signed certificates must be redeployed on all
remaining nodes BEFORE they are upgraded. If you do not do this, the
upgrade will fail. Use CLI zmcertmgr to add the certificates. As root, type

/opt/zimbra/bin/zmcertmgr deploycrt self

Process

1. Log in as root to the Zimbra server and cd to the directory where the ZCS

upgrade archive tar file is saved (cd /var/tmp). Type the following
commands:

tar xzvf zcs.tgz, to unpack the file

cd [zcsversionfullname], to change to the correct directory

./install.sh, to begin the upgrade installation

The upgrade script begins by checking for an existing installation.

2.   Three software license agreements are displayed. Read these license

agreements and enter Y for each.

3.   The installer checks for prerequisites. If any are missing, the upgrade

stops.

4.   When you upgrade the mail store server, the installer displays Do you want
to verify message store database integrity (Y) is displayed. The default is
Yes. This step runs zmdbintegrityreport to verify that the MySQL®
database is not corrupt before upgrading to the latest ZCS.

Running zmdbintegrityreport can take minutes to an hour to run,
depending on your system size and disk bandwidth. It is preferable that
you run zmdbintegrityreport at the time of the ZCS upgrade. If you choose
to skip this now, the zmdbintegrityreport will run during a regular scheduled
interval after the upgrade is finished.

When the MySQL software versions are changed during upgrades, the
underlying database tables need to be upgraded. The zmdbintegrityreport
does this automatically during it’s first run and will report the changes.
These are normal and should not cause alarm when upgrading.

5.   When Do you wish to upgrade? [Y] is displayed, press Enter to continue.

The upgrade packages are unpacked.

6.   The packages you want to install on the server should be marked Y. All

other packages should be marked N.

The upgrade checks that there is enough space to perform the upgrade. If
there is not enough space, the upgrade stops.

7.   When The system will be modified. Continue? is displayed, type Y and

press Enter. The server is stopped and the older packages are removed.
The upgrade process verifies which version of ZCS is being run and

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

proceeds to upgrade the services, restores the existing configuration files,
and restarts the system. If you have a configuration with a large number of
accounts created, this can take a while.

8.   When Configuration complete – press return to exit displays, press Enter.

The upgrade is complete. Continue to upgrade each server.

After the Upgrade is Complete

Important:  A known issue is the administration console might report a
CSFE_SVC_ERROR with HTTP status code 503 when viewing the HSM or
indexing sections. Users experiencing this frequently might add the
administrator's web browser IP address to the DOS filter whitelist. See http://
wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/DoSFilter for details on whitelist configuration. (Bug
82384)

After you completed the upgrade, the following bullet items might need to be
addressed.

 During the upgrade process, zimbra might make a binary backup of

existing databases when there are major structural changes occurring to
the database format for ease of downgrading. Administrators will want to
clean these up once they have confirmed a successful upgrade. For LDAP
servers, these backups are in /opt/zimbra/data/ldap, and in the form of
<dbname>.prev.$$" where $$ is the process ID of the upgrade script. (Bug
81167)

 You should run zmldapupgrade -b 66387 after upgrading.

Beginning with 8.0, zimbraAllowFromAddress attribute cannot be set for
internal accounts or distribution lists. Running this script will change
zimbraAllowFromAddress values to grants.

This step was not included into the installer-driven upgrade due to
potentially long delay for sites that set zimbraAllowFromAddress on many
accounts.

The migration command reports how many accounts had
zimbraAllowFromAddress attribute set and how many of them needed
migration. One way to verify all accounts got migrated is to run the
command again. The total won't change, and the number migrated should
be 0. (Bug 66387)

 If your self-signed SSL certificates have expired, update them. See Verify

Certificates Expiration Date on page 22.

 If you have configured the following keys, you will need to replace them as

described here.

The following keys are deprecated:

httpclient_client_connection_timeout

Updating your MySQL table

If you upgrading from 6.X to ZCS 8.0 or later, MySQL table upgrade is
required after upgrading. If you do not upgrade MySQL, regular reports from
zmdbintegrityreport are going to flag warnings in your MySQL table.
Customers can avoid these errors in the zmdbintegrityreport output by
executing /opt/zimbra/libexec/scripts/migrate20100913-Mysql51.pl.
(Bug 24329, 50557)

MySQL upgrades are not automatically run during the upgrade to 8.0.x,
because of the time that it takes this process to run. There is no known
performance impact when running in production without doing this MySQL
table upgrade.

Applying the Mysql51.pl script requires all Zimbra services except
mysql.server to be stopped.

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

This script should be executed on all the mailstore servers where the mailboxd
process is running. For a 4000 mailbox, 250 MB mailbox size, the script could
take about 70 minutes to run. Customers should schedule their maintenance
window accordingly.

To run the script:

1. Switch to zimbra user.

su - zimbra

2. Stop mailboxd services to avoid email communications that might cause
an interruption.

zmmailboxdctl stop

3. Execute the perl script to upgrade the database tables.

/opt/zimbra/libexec/scripts/migrate20100913-Mysql51.pl

4. Start the mailboxd service.

zmmailboxdctl start

Setting iframes

Zimbra Web Client no longer works in an iframe. If you want to continue to use
iframe, modify zimbra.web.xml.in. The parameter must be set to TRUE.

1. As zimbra user, change directories. Type

   cd /opt/zimbra/jetty/etc

2.   Edit the file zimbra.web.xml.in

3.   To use iframes, in the <filter-name>Set Header Filter</filter-name> <filter-
class>com.zimbra.webClient.filters.SetHeaderFilter</filter-class> section,
add the following

<init-param>

      <param-name>allowInFrame</param-name>

      <param-value>true</param-value>

</init-param>

4.   Restart ZCS.

Remove Current Version and Perform Clean Install of ZCS

If you do not want to upgrade, but prefer to install ZCS Open Source Edition
8.0.6 as a new installation, when you run the ZCS  install script, enter N (no)
when asked Do you wish to upgrade?

A warning displays asking if you want to delete all existing users and mail. If
you enter Yes, all users, mail, and previous files are removed before

 Zimbra Collaboration Server

 Open Source Edition 8.0.6   29

Release Notes and Upgrade Instructions

proceeding with the new installation. Refer to the installation guides for
installation instructions.

Status of Your Customization to ZCS after Upgrade

Upgrading to the newest release does not delete your accounts or change
your configuration.

Configuration settings stored in LDAP and localconfig are preserved during
upgrades. Any files installed by ZCS might be deprecated and/or overwritten
during upgrades, removing any customizations. This includes customized
themes, logo branding changes, and crontab changes.

Only the core Zimlets are enabled after the upgrade. Zimlets that you
customized and/or deployed are preserved during the upgrade but will be
disabled. As upgrading of customized Zimlets cannot be tested before the
release, Zimbra recommends that you verify that your customized Zimlets
work correctly before re-enabling them for your end-users after the upgrade.
The core Zimlet list is on page 20.

Note:   When upgrading to ZCS 8.0.x from a previous major ZCS version, the
upgrade step disables zimlets that are not the core zimlets for ZCS in
all COSs. If you have enabled other zimlets at the account level, you
might need to manually disable these zimlets. (Bug 77836)

All entries between the designated comments in the Zimbra crontab file are
overwritten with new defaults upon upgrade.

Changes to Customized Themes

In ZCS 8.0, a new design for default skins was implemented. Custom skins
created for Zimbra 7.x might not work as intended with Zimbra 8.x. Depending
on what's in the skin, the issues might range from simple things such as colors
being used in the wrong places to larger issues like functional components

this is to take an existing 8.x skin, duplicate it, and update the skin to meet the
same needs as the old skin. (Bug 62523)

Numerous known issues when using Outlook 2013 Exchange ActiveSync.

Since 8.0.0

Rolling Upgrades. Multinode configuration with self-signed certificates will not
function in a rolling upgrade.

If self-signed certificates are used, after the LDAP master is upgraded, the self-
signed certificates must be redeployed on all remaining nodes before they are
upgraded or the upgrade will fail.

Workaround: Use commercial certificates with rolling upgrades.

75280

Won’t fix. When using the new quick reply feature to reply to a message, the
original message is not added as an attachment, even if the user’s preferences
are set to include the original message. This is the correct behavior.

74941/75474 Won’t fix. Users on a mailbox server at 7.2.x cannot send a message “on-behalf-
of”  or “send as” for a user that is on a server upgraded to 8.0.x.

Make sure all users sending mail on behalf of (OBO) are on ZCS 8.0

Rolling Upgrades. While in rolling upgrade mode, cross version sharing does
not work. Users on ZCS 7.x cannot access shares on ZCS 8.0.

Workaround: While in rolling upgrade mode, use the command line search
across accounts.
/opt/zimbra/bin/zmmboxsearch -m "*" -q "test"

Rolling Upgrade: Address Book. While in rolling upgrade mode, contact Group
members are not displayed when users on a 7.2 mailbox server share their
address book with users on an 8.0.x mailbox server.

Rolling Upgrade.The preauth failed request does not lockout the account with
lockout setting. This works correctly when the mailbox server is upgraded.

Rolling Upgrade. You cannot move an account from a later version of ZCS to an
earlier version. For example, an account on a server at ZCS 8.0 cannot be
moved to a ZCS server at 7.2.

Rolling Upgrade. If a calendar resource is renamed while you are performing a
rolling upgrade make sure the rename requests are sent to the LDAP server that
has been upgraded to 8.0.x.

Rolling Upgrade. While in rolling upgrade mode, admins should deploy the drag
and drop zimlet for 7.x users during a rolling upgrade, as this zimlet is no longer
utilized in Zimbra 8.0.x as functionality has moved into core product code.

Rolling Upgrade. In Zimbra 8.0.x checklists are defaulted to off. If the behavior
for users in ZCS 7.2 was to have the check list feature enabled, admins will
need to change the COS settings or users can modify their preferences to
maintain the same behavior.

Rolling Upgrade. Even if the emoticons zimlet was enabled for accounts at
7.2.x, after the rolling upgrade this zimlet is not available in the user’s
Preferences page.
Administrators should redeploy the zimlet. The zimlet zip file is in the /opt/
zimbra/zimlets directory.

Some browser issues can affect how the Zimbra administration console and
Zimbra Web Client work.

When you get a browser error, try reloading the browser to continue.
•

If you use the Firefox browser, the cursor position may not be visible in the
text boxes, and you have no visual feedback to continue to enter text. Even
though you cannot see the cursor, type in the boxes as normal.

Depending on the status of a primary LDAP connection problem, the failover to
another LDAP server is not working.

In a multi-server environment that has both master and replicas, the zmprov -l
option does not fallback to the replica if the master is down.

The administration console might report a CSFE_SVC_ERROR with HTTP
status code 503 when viewing the HSM or indexing sections. Users
experiencing this frequently might add the administrator's web browser IP
address to the DOS filter whitelist. See http://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/DoSFilter for
details on whitelist configuration.

S/MIME does not work with Firefox 22.

Contacts with an anniversary added to the Zimbra Web Client are unable to
sync when using Outlook 2013 Exchange ActiveSync.

Installing Certificate from the administration console issue: If you do not have an
existing .csr on the server, the Download the CSR link in the Certificate
Installation Wizard does not work.

Work around: Make sure that a .csr file is in the ${zimbra_home}/mailboxd/
webapps/zimbraAdmin/tmp/current.csr directory before you begin. When you
configure the new certificate from the administration console, make sure you
check Replace the existing CSR on the Generate the Certificate Signing
Request page in the certificate installation wizard.

If you have replica servers or are in multi-master mode, you have to install the
Zimbra LDAP schema specific to the release you are upgrading to onto the
replica servers or onto the multi-master server before you upgrade to ZCS 8.0.4
or later. See Upgrading LDAP Replica Servers or Multi-Master Server from ZCS
8.0.0, 8.0.1, 8.0.2 to ZCS 8.0.4 and later on page 23.

Customers currently on ZCS 6.0.8 and using a non-default password change
listener should make sure that the zimbraPasswordChangeListener attribute is
set up correctly at the domain level, before upgrading to ZCS 7.x.

To check the value of the attribute, run
$ zmprov gd YOUR_DOMAIN zimbraPasswordChangeListener
To change the value, say, to the samba password listener, run
$ zmprov md YOUR_DOMAIN zimbraPasswordChangeListener

Calendar Week Numbers displayed in the mini-calendar must be set to Monday
to display the correct European week numbers.

If the Short Cut Trainer zimlet is enabled, when a message is deleted a script
error is displayed. To avoid this, disable this zimlet. This is not a supported
zimlet.

Family Mailbox was not supported in ZCS 7.X. See Changes to ZCS 8.0 on
page 20 for more information.

A forwarded recurring appointment instance will not update the organizer’s
attendee list. Therefore, if the organizer modifies the appointment, the user with
the forwarded appointment will not get updated.

After activating or updating a license, the administrator can run
zmprov fc -a license to immediately flush the license cache on all mailbox
nodes.

Third-party issue. iPhone calendar might not sync correctly when declining or
accepting an appointment in ZWC after the appointment has already been
accepted/declined from iPhone.

The Undo Send Zimlet might cause messages to be sent with no content in the
body. To avoid this, disable the Zimlet.

The ability to completely disable SSL Renegotiation might be desirable for some
environments, but due to the performance degradation it is not optimal to use as
a default setting.

The SslSelectChannelConnector can be forced to disable client renegotiate
requests via the "allowRenegotiate" attribute, for said connector, in jetty.xml.in/
jetty.xml.

The default setting is allowRenegotiate=TRUE. Explicitly setting to "FALSE" will
configure ZCS to always disallow SSL renegotiation for the SSL connector in
question. A mailboxd restart is required for this change.

For instance:
<New id="ssl"class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.ssl.SslSelectChannelConnector">
<Set name="Port">%%zimbraMailSSLPort%%</Set>
<Set name="allowRenegotiate">FALSE</Set>
<Set name="useDirectBuffers">%%zimbraMailUseDirectBuffers%%</Set>
<Set name="maxIdleTime">30000</Set>
<Set name="lowResourcesMaxIdleTime">10000</Set>
<Set name="Acceptors">2</Set>
<Set name="keystore"><SystemProperty name="jetty.home"

<Set name="ExcludeCipherSuites">

</Array>
</Set>
<Set name="Forwarded">true</Set>
</New>

When receiving an encrypted message with attachments, the Download,
Briefcase and Remove links are not displayed, and the size of the attachment is
not available.

Zimbra logger is not directly supported in mixed syslog (rsyslog, syslogd,
sysklogd) environments due to formatting differences between the varying
systems.

Product Documentation

Online help and ZCS documents are available on the administration console.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
