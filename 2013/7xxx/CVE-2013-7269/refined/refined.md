  "CVE-2013-7269": {
    "vulnerability_details": "An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improperly initialized msg_name & msg_namelen message header parameters within the Linux kernel's socket layer during recvmsg(2) and recvfrom(2) socket calls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can exploit this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes, potentially revealing sensitive information.",
