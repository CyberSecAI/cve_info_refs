The provided content is related to CVE-2013-3514 and CVE-2013-3515, not CVE-2013-7376. It describes multiple vulnerabilities in OpenX, including a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability (CVE-2013-3514) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-3515).

**CVE-2013-3514 (Local File Inclusion)**

*   **Root cause:** Improper sanitization of the `group` HTTP GET parameter in `/www/admin/plugin-preferences.php` and `/www/admin/plugin-settings.php` scripts, allowing directory traversal sequences and URL-encoded NULL bytes to be used in PHP's `include()` function.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Local File Inclusion (LFI).
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary local file inclusion, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Direct exploitation by an authenticated administrator.
    *   CSRF attacks, allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to exploit the vulnerability by tricking a logged-in administrator into accessing a crafted web page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   Direct exploitation requires administrative access to the OpenX interface.
    *   CSRF exploitation requires the ability to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page.

**CVE-2013-3515 (Cross-Site Scripting)**
*   **Root cause**: Insufficient filtering of user-supplied data in the "package" GET parameter passed to "/www/admin/plugin-index.php" and the "group" GET parameter passed to "/www/admin/plugin-settings.php"
*   **Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in the browser of a logged-in administrator in the context of the vulnerable website. This allows an attacker to potentially steal cookies or perform actions on behalf of the admin.
*   **Attack vectors:** Remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to trick a logged-in admin into opening a malicious link.

The advisory also mentions that the vulnerabilities were fixed by the vendor in SVN revision 82710 and provides links to the updated files and a diff file.
