| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1046839#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-12-27 05:07:26 UTC  ``` In Fedora 19, the "Enter the Command" dialog box is visible even after you lock the screen, so anyone can write the commands in the box and execute them over a locked screen.  The issue is still to be fixed and tested on Gnome Fedora 18 and 19 machines. KDE version were not found to be affected.  This flaw is split from [bug 1030431](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-7220 gnome-shell: blind command execution via activities search keyboard focus")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1046839#c1)  Huzaifa S.

Subject: Two CVE request for gnome-shell/screensaver issues

Hi All,

I would like to request CVEs for two slightly related
gnome-shell/screensaver issues. Details as follows:

1. gnome-shell: blind command execution via activities search keyboard focus
The issue is that in Fedora 18, when you open either the Activities
panel or "Enter a command" dialog box (Alt+F2), and then lock the screen
or let the screensaver lock the screen, then if you start typing on the
lock screen, instead of entering the password or just waking the screen,
it actually types anything you type on the Activities panel or "Enter a
command" dialog box, so anyone who enters a executable command and press
enter, the command is executed even when the screen is locked.

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686740>

And a series of commits fix this issue via:
