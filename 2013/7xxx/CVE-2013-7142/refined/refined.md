Vulnerability Details:
Embedding Javascript code within certain parameters of oAuth API calls can lead to reflected script execution within the user's context and a trusted domain.

Root cause of vulnerability:
Improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags in a web page.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data within oAuth API call parameters.

Impact of exploitation:
Malicious script code execution within the user's context. This can lead to session hijacking, triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (e.g., sending mail, deleting data), and luring the user to untrusted content while still within the context of a trusted domain.

Attack vectors:
Network-based attack via crafted oAuth API calls containing malicious JavaScript code.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to craft malicious oAuth API calls and induce a user to execute them (e.g., via a malicious link).
