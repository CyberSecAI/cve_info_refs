Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7452:

**Summary:**

This CVE refers to a vulnerability found in the `validator` package for Node.js, specifically before version 1.1.0. It involves a bypass of the XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) filter through the use of `javascript:` URIs.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from an insufficient filtering of user-supplied input when using the `validator` library.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The specific weakness is the failure to properly sanitize or block `javascript:` URIs within the input processed by the XSS filter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript code into web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to a range of attacks, including stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, and modifying page content.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is processed by the vulnerable `validator` library and displayed on a web page. By crafting a string containing a `javascript:` URI, the attacker can bypass the filter and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious strings into input that is processed by the vulnerable `validator` component. This could be through various means, such as user forms, URL parameters or other methods where user input is displayed within the web application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided document indicates that CVE-2013-7451, CVE-2013-7453, and CVE-2013-7454 are also related to XSS filter bypasses within the same `validator` package before version 1.1.0, specifically involving nested tags, UI redressing, and nested forbidden strings, respectively.
*   The context of this CVE is related to vulnerabilities found in Node.js packages.
