      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-7349",
      "root_cause": "This CVE ID is associated with multiple vulnerabilities in Gnew 2013.1, specifically a PHP File Inclusion vulnerability (CVE-2013-5639) and several SQL Injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2013-5640). The root cause of these vulnerabilities is insufficient validation of user-supplied input.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "PHP File Inclusion [CWE-98]: Improper validation of the `gnew_language` cookie allows inclusion of arbitrary local files.",
        "SQL Injection [CWE-89]:  Insufficient filtration of parameters including `friend_email`, `user_email`, `answer_id`, `question_id`, and `story_id`, and `thread_id` via HTTP POST requests to different scripts, allowing the execution of arbitrary SQL commands."
      ],
       "impact": "Arbitrary PHP code execution, exposure of sensitive information, and manipulation of data via SQL injection.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attackers can exploit the file inclusion vulnerability by manipulating the `gnew_language` cookie.",
         "Remote unauthenticated attackers can exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities by manipulating HTTP POST parameters to `/news/send.php` and `/users/register.php`.",
         "Remote authenticated attackers can exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities by manipulating HTTP POST parameters to `/polls/vote.php`, `/comments/add.php`, `/comments/edit.php`, `/posts/add.php`, and `/posts/edit.php`."

      "attacker_capabilities": [
        "For the PHP file inclusion, no authentication is needed.",
        "For SQL injection in `/news/send.php` and `/users/register.php`, no authentication is needed.",
        "For SQL injection in `/polls/vote.php`, `/comments/add.php`, `/comments/edit.php`, `/posts/add.php`, and `/posts/edit.php`, the attacker needs to be a registered and logged-in user."
