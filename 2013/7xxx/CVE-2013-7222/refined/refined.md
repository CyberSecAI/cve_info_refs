Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7222:

**CVE-2013-7222** relates to the lack of support for cycling the Rails session secret in Fat Free CRM.

**Root Cause:**
The application used a static, default secret token for verifying the integrity of signed cookies. This secret was publicly available within the source code, making it possible for an attacker to forge signed cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Static Secret Token:** The application used a hardcoded, publicly available secret token, which should be unique and private to each instance.
- **Lack of Secret Rotation:** The application did not enforce or guide users to change the default secret.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker knowing the secret token could forge signed cookies, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Exploiting a Known Secret:** An attacker who is aware of the default secret token (found in the source code) can forge cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to know the default static secret token, which is publicly available in the source code.
- No specific user interaction or prior access is required.
- The attacker needs the ability to forge HTTP requests with crafted cookies.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves requiring users to run `rake ffcrm:secret` to generate a unique secret token during setup.
- The commit `93c182dd4c6f3620b721d2a15ba6a6ecab5669df` addresses this issue.
- The vulnerability is mentioned in the context of multiple security flaws discovered in Fat Free CRM.
