Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7240:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw in the `download-file.php` file of the "Advanced Dewplayer" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `dew_file` parameter in `download-file.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify file paths outside of the intended directory. This enables access to arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application directly uses the value provided in the request parameter to access files, without validation or authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access sensitive files, such as the `wp-config.php` file, which contains database credentials, authentication keys, and salts. This could lead to full compromise of the WordPress site and its associated database.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited to read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `download-file.php` script.
*   **Manipulated `dew_file` Parameter:** The `dew_file` parameter within the crafted GET request is manipulated to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to navigate the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerable code exists within the `download-file.php` file.
* The vulnerable parameter is `dew_file`.
* An example of a vulnerable URL is:  `http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/advanced-dewplayer/admin-panel/download-file.php?dew_file=../../../../wp-config.php`

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Henri Salo.
*   The maintainers of the Advanced Dewplayer plugin have released a fix by restricting the file types allowed for download via the `download-file.php` script.
*   The issue was addressed in version 1.3 of the plugin as noted in the changelog
