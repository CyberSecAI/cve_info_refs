# USN-2945-1: XChat-GNOME vulnerability

4 April 2016

XChat-GNOME could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [xchat-gnome](/security/cves?package=xchat-gnome) - simple and featureful IRC client for GNOME

## Details

It was discovered that XChat-GNOME incorrectly verified the hostname in an

SSL certificate. An attacker could trick XChat-GNOME into trusting a rogue

server's certificate, which was signed by a trusted certificate authority,

to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack.

# SSL: The certificate's Common Name (CN) field is not verified #524

## Description

[![@andreyv](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/397308?v=4&size=48)](/andreyv)[andreyv](https://github.com/andreyv)opened [on Apr 9, 2013](https://github.com/hexchat/hexchat/issues/524#issue-12964255)

HexChat doesn't check that the server-offered certificate really corresponds to the domain name HexChat is connecting to. In other words, it will accept any certificate, as long as it is signed by one of CAs that OpenSSL trusts.

Attack example: Mallet registers a domain name super.hacker.com and obtains a valid CA-signed SSL certificate for this domain. When Alice is connecting to chat.freenode.net, Mallet MITMs the connection and supplies his own certificate to Alice. Since it is not verified that the certificate actually corresponds to chat.freenode.net, verification succeeds and the secure connection is now compromised.
