Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2013-7329:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A flaw in the `CGI::Application` Perl module, specifically related to how it handles cases where run modes are not specified.
*   The `dump_html` function was being called unexpectedly, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.
*   The issue was introduced in version 4.19 of the module with commit `61d327646f01fe`, where the initialization of the default `run_mode` moved from the `setup()` function to being hardcoded in the `run_mode()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The module would dump web query data and server environment information as an error page when no run modes are specified, exposing potentially sensitive information.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** The default behavior of calling `dump_html` when no run modes were set was not expected or intended, and was not documented.
*   **API Change:** A change in the API caused applications that did not explicitly specify a start run mode to inadvertently trigger the vulnerable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially obtain sensitive information, such as web query parameters and server environment variables, leading to a loss of confidentiality.
*   **Unintended data leaks:** Applications could unexpectedly leak data due to the change in the default behavior, potentially including user-specific data, system information, or secrets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when a web application using the vulnerable `CGI::Application` module does not specify a run mode when processing a request.
*   Attackers could potentially craft requests that do not specify run modes to trigger the vulnerable code path, causing sensitive data to be exposed.
*   Applications that relied on the old behavior of `setup()` were also affected by this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a web application that is using the vulnerable `CGI::Application` module.
*   The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*  The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves introducing a new run mode (`no_runmodes`) that displays an error message when no run modes are specified, rather than calling `dump_html`.
*   The patch ensures that a valid HTML page is returned in such cases.
*   The documentation for the `dump_html` function has been updated to warn users of potential security issues.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in versions 4.50-2 and later in Debian, 4.50-7 in Fedora 19, 4.50-9 in Fedora 20, and 4.50-4 in EPEL 6.
*   The fix was also backported to older versions of the affected distributions.
*   The issue was initially reported on CPAN RT as bug #84403.
