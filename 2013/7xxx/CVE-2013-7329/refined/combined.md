| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1067180#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-19 22:14:54 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that the CGI::Application perl module suffered from a flaw where, in certain cases, it would unexpectedly dump a complete set of web query data and server environment information as an error page.  This could allow unintended disclosure of sensitive information.  A suggested fix is available [3] and the commit that caused the problem [4] was most likely introduced in version 4.19.

Subject: CVE request for CGI::Application information disclosure flaw

I don't believe a CVE was requested for this issue.  Looks like it requires a 2013 CVE.  Copying-and-pasting from our bug [5]:

It was reported [1],[2] that the CGI::Application perl module suffered from a flaw where, in certain cases, it would unexpectedly dump a complete set of web query data and server environment information as an error page.  This could allow unintended disclosure of sensitive information.

A suggested fix is available [3] and the commit that caused the problem [4] was most likely introduced in version 4.19.

```
Package: libcgi-application-perl
Version: 4.31-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security upstream patch
Justification: user security hole

An API change indroduced in 2008 alrealy (commit 61d327646f01fe) may cause
unexpected and unwanted data dumps of a complete set of web query data and
environment to the public. Developers of web apps written before the change are
probably unaware of the problem since the general behaviour does change only
in the case of a software error.

The issue has already been reported here:
<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=84403>

A patch has already been suggested here:
<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=84403>

IMHO you should consider a security backport of the patch for all
affected package versions.

For those who haven't looked at it in detail, the bug here is that
CGI::Application will dump the script environment to the web client if the
Perl application that uses it doesn't define a start runmode.  However,
not defining a start runmode is an erroneous use of the library and a bug
in the calling application, and all the examples in the documentation do
set a start runmode.

I agree that the behavior when a runmode is not defined is surprising and
a bug, but I think treating it as a full-blown security vulnerability in
CGI::Application (as opposed to the calling application) may be overkill.
That said, it looks like Fedora did treat it as a security update.

The patch in the Github pull request does look correct (although it's an
irritating patch from a security perspective since it includes apparently
arbitrary code reformatting).

Hi, I'm CGI-Application's maintainer in Fedora.

Yup. I decided to err on the side of caution. Like you, I tend to think
this is overkill but you never know what an application's ENV contains
and I can see CGI-Application's behaviour coming as a surprise.

> The patch in the Github pull request does look correct (although it's an
> irritating patch from a security perspective since it includes apparently

Indeed. I took the liberty of taking only the parts of the patch that were
important and leaving the code reformatting pieces behind. As a result, the
patch Fedora ships is less intrusive than the one submitted upstream.

You can get a copy of the patch by running the command:
git clone git://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/perl-CGI-Application

### @MartinMcGrath **[MartinMcGrath](/MartinMcGrath)** commented [Jan 27, 2014](#issue-26370489)

This pull request resolves the issue raised in <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=84403>

Application.pm

A new runmode named `no_runmodes` is now called rather than `dump_html` when no run modes are specified. This returns a message to the user reporting the problem, without exposing anything which may raise security concerns. The POD has been updated, asking the user to think about potential security issues when calling dump\_html.

basic.t/TestApp.pm

Add tests for the new runmode

load\_tmpl\_hook.t

Test required an update as it was dependant on Application.pm returning the output of `dump_html`

In addition to the changes above, some very minor changes to the indentation.

If there are any issues please let me know.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I would like to STRONGLY endorse the application of this patch. I just was about to open an report for exactly this issue when I found it already addressed by Martin. The problem has been introduced with commit [61d3276](https://github.com/markstos/CGI--Application/commit/61d327646f01fe3483de8f69c644b67df795d622) already but probably did not cause major hassle until it arrived in recent debian repos lately. The security implications of an unexpected and potentially uncontrollable var dump to the world are very serious. We also have lost quite some time trying to find out where this unexpected dump came from in the first place and how it was caused. As an added "bonus", the output of dump\_html is not even a valid html page. |

See also: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=739505>  This bug report is wrong. There was no change in 2008 which "caused" this "problem."  CGI::Application has *always* called dump\_html(), since it was first written. It's been that way for more than a decade, and in that time there has *never been any report of any break-in or security problem* as a result of this.  The purpose of calling dump\_html() is to demonstrate that the application module is working. If a developer installs a bit of code on their web server, and then fails to actually configure it in any way, of course they are going to create problems for themselves. Imagine the dev who installs something like "PhpMyAdmin" and never changes the default password. The security problem is the developer who is failing to do their job in a professional manner... and there's no patch for that.

| fionnb  This second pull request was to address the "bonus" issue you raised, the first which you endorse, apparently because you experienced the problem, would seem to match your requirements. If this is not the case perhaps a short test case replicating your problem would help.  Jesse,  My patch does not remove dump\_html, rather it's no longer called by default when no runmodes are specified. You can still call dump\_html. As you say the developer should be aware of what they're doing by deliberately dumping $ENV to a page.  In my patch the default runmode when none are provided reports this back to the user, rather than the output of dump\_html(). This could be used "to demonstrate that the application module is working", without exposing anything unnecessarily.  Thanks |

I even linked the commmit id four your convenience, did you see? The initialisation of run\_mode to call dump\_html by default moved from setup() to be hard coded in run\_mode(). So, until 2008, if you overloaded setup() - which everyone does - you had NO start->dump\_html default at all in run\_mode!  After the change, you ALWAYS have dump\_html as a default run\_mode unless you explicitly redefine it in your code. Before the change this was not the case. A company I work at sells and runs a major enterprise application system written in perl and this change caused pages with sensitive data to appear in case of an error because some submodules did not have start defined in run\_mode. This problem occurs ONLY with the new version and not with the old one.  Facts: Behaviour of an otherwise unmodified application changed due to an update of Application.pm. Data that should not be shown AND was not shown when using versions before v4.19 was now on screen. Customers were not amused. Considerable amounts of manpower where spent trying to trace the origin of the unexpected "leak" through several application layers. So, please don't tell me that nothing happened.  CGI::Application has *always* called dump\_html(), since it was first written. It's been that way for more than a decade, and in that time there has *never been any report of any break-in or security problem* as a result of this.  I'd dare to say that this default should never have been defined that way at all. Not the version before 08, and even more so the one after. Direction of potentially sensitive data into a publicly accessible entity should ALWAYS be the result of a willful act of the developer and NEVER be triggered by any automatism whatsoever. As an added "bonus" in this case, the documentation (README, Changelog) does neither mention the potentially dangerous "default" nor the behavioral change in the API in any way.  The chances to be hit by this definitely have increased with the above mentioned code change for the reasons explained.  Thank you for reading. I hope to have clarified any doubts now about why this IS indeed an important fix and it should be applied without hesitation. |

| With [CPAN day](http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2014/07/cpan-day---14th-august.html) coming up in 10 days time I was wondering if it we could merge this (and [#16](https://github.com/markstos/CGI--Application/pull/16)) and have a new CPAN release, since the current release is from 2011.  Alternatively if there's anything I can do to help please let me know.  Thanks |
