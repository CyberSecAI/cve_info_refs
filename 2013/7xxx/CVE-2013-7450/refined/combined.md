From: Randy Barlow <rbarlow@...hat.com>
To: Pulp Users <pulp-list@...hat.com>,
        OSS Security <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>
Subject: CVE-2013-7450: Pulp < 2.3.0 distributed the same CA key to all users

Versions of Pulp < 2.3.0 distributed the same certificate authority key and
certificate to all Pulp users[0]. This CA is used by the /login API call
(pulp-admin login uses this call) to generate and sign a client certificate.
This client certificate is then used for subsequent API calls.

Due to this vulnerability, remote attackers are able to obtain the CA key
from the Pulp git repository and use it to generate valid client certificates
for any Pulp installations that use the default CA. The Pulp documentation
did not emphasize the importance of replacing this CA for production
deployments, so there may be users who use this common CA key in production
environments.

Users are urged to replace the CA certificate and key on any Pulp
installations that began their life with a version less than 2.3.0. Upgrading
alone is not sufficient, as Pulp upgrades do not replace existing CA key
pairs. Versions of Pulp >= 2.3.0 do ship a utility (pulp-gen-ca-certificate)
that is capable of generating a new CA keypair for you, but it should be
noted that there are some known local attacks that this script is vulnerable
to as well[1][2]. The best option is to generate your own CA certificate if
you are concerned about these local attacks.

Thanks to Sander Bos for notifying the Pulp team that we had neglected to
acquire a CVE for this vulnerability at the time of its discovery.

Subject: Pulp 2.8.3 Released to address multiple CVEs

Pulp 2.8.3 has been released to address multiple CVEs:

CVE-2016-3111 (Low Impact):
pulp.spec generates its RSA keys for message signing insecurely
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1837>

CVE-2016-3112 (Moderate Impact):
Pulp consumer private keys are world-readable
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1834>

CVE-2016-3107 (Moderate Impact):
Node certificate containing private key stored in world-readable file
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1833>

CVE-2016-3108 (Moderate Impact):
Insecure temporary file used when generating certificate for Pulp Nodes
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1830>

CVE-2016-3106 (Low Impact):
Insecure creation of temporary directory when generating new CA key
<https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1827>

Additionally, CVE-2013-7450[0] was announced during this release cycle
even though it was fixed in Pulp 2.3.0. Users who have upgraded from
Pulp < 2.3.0 may still be vulnerable, action may be required.

Users should read the release notes[1] and the mailing list
announcement[2] to learn more.

Thanks to Florian Weimer, Sander Bos, and Jeremy Cline for reporting
these issues and submitting patches.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c0)  Randy Barlow    2013-09-01 22:07:24 UTC  ``` I learned during our refactor this weekend that we have ca.{crt,key} files in our git repository that our RPM packages and installs on every Pulp installation. This is very bad.  To make matters worse, there is only a tiny paragraph in our docs that mention quite casually that you should make your own SSL certificates. This is putting our users at risk, particularly ones who don't know the full depths of our use of CA certificates. This is particularly bad due to the understated nature of the documentation telling users that they can change the CA if they want to.  A very easy solution would be to have the %post% section of our spec file autogenerate a new CA certificate and key when the package is installed. This has the benefit of still making it easy to install Pulp for newcomers, while also not putting those users at risk to man in the middle attacks. It's still exactly the same effort for the user to install their own CA, if they wish.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c1)  Jeff Ortel    2013-09-19 23:07:40 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/pulp/pulp/pull/627>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c2)  Jeff Ortel    2013-09-26 15:36:36 UTC  ``` build: 2.3.0-0.15.alpha   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c3)  Preethi Thomas    2013-09-30 12:54:50 UTC  ``` verified [root@pulp-v2-server ~]# rpm -qa pulp-server pulp-server-2.3.0-0.16.alpha.el6.noarch [root@pulp-v2-server ~]#   [root@pulp-v2-server ~]# ls -l /etc/pki/pulp/ total 20 -rw-r-----. 1 root   apache 1082 Sep 27 08:33 ca.crt -rw-r-----. 1 root   apache 1675 Sep 27 08:33 ca.key drwxr-xr-x. 2 apache apache 4096 Sep 26 16:44 content drwxr-xr-x. 2 root   root   4096 Sep 27 09:52 nodes drwxr-xr-x. 3 root   root   4096 Sep 19 15:03 qpid [root@pulp-v2-server ~]#   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1003326#c4)  Preethi Thomas    2013-12-09 14:31:29 UTC  ``` Pulp 2.3 released.   ``` |  |

Use CVE-2013-7450.

(We're interpreting this as a request from the Pulp upstream vendor.
In general, it would be hard for a third party to determine whether a
"tiny paragraph" was generally recognized as a required part of the
installation process.)

**Description**

Security researcher Sander Bos contacted the Pulp team to notify us

that the pulp-gen-nodes-certificate script suffers from the same

exploit as was found in CVE-2016-3095, namely that the $TMP

directory that contains the Nodes private key was created in an

unsafe manner. The fix is to use mktemp -d to safely create the

directory.

Thanks to Sander Bos for taking the time to carefully inspect the

Pulp codebase and for writing a wonderfully detailed report

describing the issue and the fix for it.

Credit also goes to Jeremy Cline (Red Hat) for independently

reporting this issue.

[Revision 8571d9a0](/projects/pulp/repository/pulp/revisions/8571d9a0cd7a7cb68c8e8640d01bfbd3560509cf "Revision 8571d9a0")

CVE-2016-3107 & CVE-2016-3108: Safely generate Nodes certificate.

This commit fixes two CVEs.

# CVE-2016-3107[¶](#CVE-2016-3107)

Install Node certificate with 640, apache owned (CVE-2016-3107).

Prior to this commit, the Node certificate had been installed
world-readable:

$ ls -lah /etc/pki/pulp/nodes/
total 4.0K
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 21 Apr 8 16:37 .
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root 90 Apr 8 16:37 ..
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 3.2K Apr 8 16:37 node.crt

This commit adjusts the generation script to limit the permissions
to 0640, and to adjust the group ownership to the apache group.

Credit also goes to Jeremy Cline (Red Hat) for independently
discovering and reporting this issue.

fixes [#1833](/issues/1833 "Issue: CVE-2016-3107: Node certificate containing private key stored in world-readable file (CLOSED - CURRENTRELEASE)")

# CVE-2016-3108[¶](#CVE-2016-3108)

Safely create tmp dir for the Nodes certificate (CVE-2016-3108).

Security researcher Sander Bos contacted the Pulp team to notify us
that the pulp-gen-nodes-certificate script suffers from the same
exploit as was found in CVE-2016-3095, namely that the $TMP
directory that contains the Nodes private key was created in an
unsafe manner. This commit contains his proposed fix to use
mktemp -d to safely create the directory.

Additionally, I added a set -e so that the script would exit upon
error.

Thanks to Sander Bos for taking the time to carefully inspect the
Pulp codebase and for writing a wonderfully detailed report
describing the issue and the fix for it.

Credit also goes to Jeremy Cline (Red Hat) for independently
reporting this issue.

### CVE-2016-3106: Insecure creation of temporary directory when generating new CA key

**Description**

The pulp-gen-ca-certificate script created

the Pulp CA certificate and key in /tmp/$RANDOM. This led to about

32,768 possible directories. Florian Weimer and Sander Bos

notified the Pulp team that if a user happened to own a directory

that the script chose, the user would be able to read the

certificate authority certificate. Additionally, both security

researchers concluded that there is a race condition between

creating the secure folder and the later chmod, during which an

attacker could read and hold open the inode for the $TMP

directory. This would allow an attacker to read the key that is

later written.

Sander Bos additionally concluded that an attacker could create a

DoS attack two ways: 0) By creating a symlink within the $TMP

directory that points at an important system resource, such as

/etc/passwd, or 1) By creating $TMP itself as a symlink to /,

which would cause / to be chmod'd to 0700 later in the script.

The fix adjusts the script to use mktemp -d to ensure that a

unique and safe directory is used to create the Pulp CA

certificate. Additionally, the script uses set -e so that it will

halt if there are errors.

Thanks to Florian Weimer and to Sander Bos for independently

notifying Pulp of the issue and for suggesting the needed changes

to fix it. Thanks to Adam Mariš for advising the Pulp team through

the fix. The Pulp team is thankful to the security community for

their thoughtful analysis, and for taking the time to report these

issues.

32,768 possible directories. Florian Weimer and Sander Bos
notified the Pulp team that if a user happened to own a directory
that the script chose, the user would be able to read the
certificate authority certificate. Additionally, both security
researchers concluded that there is a race condition between
creating the secure folder and the later chmod, during which an
attacker could read and hold open the inode for the $TMP
directory. This would allow an attacker to read the key that is
later written.

Sander Bos additionally concluded that an attacker could create a
DoS attack two ways: 0) By creating a symlink within the $TMP
directory that points at an important system resource, such as
/etc/passwd, or 1) By creating $TMP itself as a symlink to /,
which would cause / to be chmod'd to 0700 later in the script.

This commit adjusts the script to use mktemp -d to ensure that a
unique and safe directory is used to create the Pulp CA
certificate. Additionally, the script uses set -e so that it will
halt if there are errors.

Thanks to Florian Weimer and to Sander Bos for independently
notifying Pulp of the issue and for suggesting the needed changes
to fix it. Thanks to Adam Mariš for advising the Pulp team through
the fix. The Pulp team is thankful to the security community for
their thoughtful analysis, and for taking the time to report these
issues.

Safely create the dir in which the CA is created (CVE-2016-3106).

Prior to this commit, the pulp-gen-ca-certificate script created
the Pulp CA certificate and key in /tmp/$RANDOM. This led to about
32,768 possible directories. Florian Weimer and Sander Bos
notified the Pulp team that if a user happened to own a directory
that the script chose, the user would be able to read the
certificate authority certificate. Additionally, both security
researchers concluded that there is a race condition between
creating the secure folder and the later chmod, during which an
attacker could read and hold open the inode for the $TMP
directory. This would allow an attacker to read the key that is
later written.

Sander Bos additionally concluded that an attacker could create a
DoS attack two ways: 0) By creating a symlink within the $TMP
directory that points at an important system resource, such as
/etc/passwd, or 1) By creating $TMP itself as a symlink to /,
which would cause / to be chmod'd to 0700 later in the script.

This commit adjusts the script to use mktemp -d to ensure that a
unique and safe directory is used to create the Pulp CA
certificate. Additionally, the script uses set -e so that it will
