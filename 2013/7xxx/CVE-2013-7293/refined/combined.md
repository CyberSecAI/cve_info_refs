## ASUS Wireless Router products contain a static DNS entry

#### Vulnerability Note VU#191750

Original Release Date: 2014-01-13 | Last Revised: 2016-05-11

---

### Overview

The ASUS WL-330NUL Pocket Wifi router and possibly other products contain a static DNS entry to the device's configuration pages.

### Description

| The ASUS WL-330NUL Pocket Wifi router and possibly other products contain static DNS entries to the device's configuration pages. The documentation advises users to configure the device via the provided URL of www.asusnetwork .net. The device has a statically configured DNS entry for this site that directs the browser to the IP address of 192.168.1.1. If a user is not connected to an ASUS device, accessing this website in lieu of entering their router's IP address may lead the victim to a malicious site that may contain malware. At the time of publication, asusnetwork .net redirects to a site serving malware. |
| --- |

### Impact

| The user may be redirected to an untrusted page that contains malware which can potentially compromise their machine. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  Asus has provided a fix for this issue. Users are advised to go to the [Asus Support Page](http://support.asus.com/download/options.aspx?SLanguage=en) and download updated firmware for their device. |
| --- |

| **Use the static IP of your router**Use the static IP address of your router (generally 192.168.1.1) in your browser instead of Asus' provided URL. |
