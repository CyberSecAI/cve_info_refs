{
  "vulnerability": {
    "overview": "The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol does not specify unique Link State Advertisement (LSA) lookup identifiers, which allow an attacker to intercept traffic or conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.",
    "description": "The OSPF protocol requires LSAs to be identified by: LS Type, Advertising Router, and Link State ID. However, during the routing table calculation phase, the specification states that an LSA is queried in the LSA database using only the Link State ID. Since the Link State ID is used in the LSA database to identify a particular router, a malformed duplicate entry can cause unexpected and insecure implementation-specific behavior. In some implementations, the vulnerability can allow an attacker to subvert the routing table of a victim router by sending false link state advertisements on behalf of other routers. This subversion can cause the victim router to drop the entire table (denial of service) or to re-route traffic on the network.",
    "impact": "This vulnerability can allow an attacker to re-route traffic, compromising the confidentiality of the data, or to conduct a denial-of-service attack against a router, dropping all traffic.",
    "root_cause": "The OSPF protocol specification does not require the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields to match when a router receives an OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA), leading to potential injection of false routes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-694: Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier"
    ],
   "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted OSPF router LSA (type-1) packets with a Link State ID and Router ID that do not match.",
        "Spoofing a legitimate OSPF peer's source IP address or sending the crafted LSA on an interface with an existing OSPF peer."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control a router within the Autonomous System (AS) and have unfiltered access to an OSPF interface that is not using MD5 authentication.",
