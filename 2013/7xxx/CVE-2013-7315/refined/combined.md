Package        : libspring-java
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4152
Debian Bug     : 720902

Alvaro Munoz discovered a XML External Entity (XXE) injection in the
Spring Framework which can be used for conducting CSRF and DoS attacks
on other sites.

The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity
resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. There are four possible
source implementations passed to the unmarshaller:

DOMSource
StAXSource
SAXSource
StreamSource

For a DOMSource, the XML has already been parsed by user code
and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.

For a StAXSource, the XMLStreamReader has already been created
by user code and that code is responsible for protecting
against XXE.

For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed
external entities by default thereby creating this
vulnerability.

The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing
by default and adding an option to enable it for those users
that need to use this feature when processing XML from a
trusted source.

It was also identified that Spring MVC processed user provided
XML with JAXB in combination with a StAX XMLInputFactory
without disabling external entity resolution. External entity
resolution has been disabled in this case.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.6.RELEASE-6+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.6.RELEASE-10.

We recommend that you upgrade your libspring-java packages.

# CVE-2013-4152 XML External Entity (XXE) injection in Spring Framework

---

*From*: Pivotal Security Team <security () gopivotal com>

*Date*: Thu, 22 Aug 2013 08:06:33 -0700 (PDT)

---

```
Severity: Important

Vendor: Spring by Pivotal

Versions Affected:
- 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 (Spring OXM & Spring MVC)
- 4.0.0.M1 (Spring OXM)
- 4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.M2 (Spring MVC)
- Earlier unsupported versions may also be affected

Description:
The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller.
There are four possible source implementations passed to the unmarshaller:
- DOMSource
- StAXSource
- SAXSource
- StreamSource
For a DOMSource, the XML has already been parsed by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.
For a StAXSource, the XMLStreamReader has already been created by user code and that code is responsible for protecting
against XXE.
For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed external entities by default thereby creating this
vulnerability.
The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing by default and adding an option to enable it for those
users that need to use this feature when processing XML from a trusted source.

It was also identified that Spring MVC processed user provided XML with JAXB in combination with a StAX XMLInputFactory
without disabling external entity resolution. External entity resolution has been disabled in this case.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:
- Users of 3.x should upgrade to 3.2.4 or later
- Users of 4.x should upgrade to 4.0.0.RC1 or later once released
Note the Spring OXM issue is fixed in 4.0.0.M2

# XXE Injection in Spring Framework

---

*From*: "MustLive" <mustlive () websecurity com ua>

*Date*: Sat, 2 Nov 2013 16:04:59 +0200

```

Hello!

```
I'll give you additional information concerning advisory XML External Entity
(XXE) Injection in Spring Framework
(<http://securityvulns.ru/docs29758.html>).
```

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

- 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 (Spring OXM & Spring MVC)
- 4.0.0.M1 (Spring OXM)
- 4.0.0.M1-4.0.0.M2 (Spring MVC)
- Earlier unsupported versions may also be affected

-------------------------
Affected vendors:
-------------------------

Spring by Pivotal.

----------
Details:
----------

```
The Spring OXM wrapper doesn't disable external entity resolution when using
the JAXB unmarshaller (SAXSource and StreamSource instances are vulnerable).
Also Spring MVC processes user provided XML with JAXB in combination with a
StAX XMLInputFactory without disabling external entity resolution.
```

```
Besides standard vectors of attacks with XXE Injection vulnerabilities (such
as local file inclusion), which are usually mentioned in advisories, XXE
Injection also allows to conduct attacks on other sites. And with using
DAVOSET (DDoS attacks via other sites execution tool) it's possible to
automate such attacks.
```

```
I wrote about such attacks in my 2012's article "Using XML External Entities
(XXE) for attacks on other sites"
(<http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2012-August/008481.html>)
and 2013's "Using XXE vulnerabilities for attacks on other sites"
(<http://lists.webappsec.org/pipermail/websecurity_lists.webappsec.org/2013-August/008887.html>).
As I described in my articles, XXE vulnerabilities can be used for
conducting CSRF and DoS attacks on other sites (and at using multiple web
sites it's possible to conduct DDoS attacks). And my tool DAVOSET can be
used for conducting such attacks via XXE vulnerabilities.
```

```
In October I released video demonstration of DAVOSET:
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKi35-f346I>
```

```
So all vulnerable web applications with affected versions of Spring
Framework can be used for attacks on other sites via XXE Injection.
```

# CVE-2013-4152 XML eXternal Entity (XXE) injection in Spring Framework

HIGH | AUGUST 22, 2013 | CVE-2013-4152
# Description

The Spring OXM wrapper did not expose any property for disabling entity resolution when using the JAXB unmarshaller. There are four possible source implementations passed to the unmarshaller: DOMSource, StAXSource, SAXSource and StreamSource.

For a DOMSource, the XML has already been parsed by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.

For a StAXSource, the XMLStreamReader has already been created by user code and that code is responsible for protecting against XXE.

For SAXSource and StreamSource instances, Spring processed external entities by default thereby creating this vulnerability.

The issue was resolved by disabling external entity processing by default and adding an option to enable it for those users that need to use this feature when processing XML from a trusted source.

# Affected Spring Products and Versions
