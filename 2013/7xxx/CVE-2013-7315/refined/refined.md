**CVE-2013-4152**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Spring OXM wrapper did not disable external entity resolution by default when using the JAXB unmarshaller with `SAXSource` and `StreamSource` instances. Additionally, Spring MVC processed user-provided XML with JAXB in combination with a StAX `XMLInputFactory` without disabling external entity resolution.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.

*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Local file inclusion (as a standard XXE vector).
    *   CSRF attacks on other sites.
    *   DoS attacks on other sites, potentially leading to DDoS when exploiting multiple vulnerable sites.

*   **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted XML document to a vulnerable Spring application.

*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send/inject XML into the vulnerable application.

The content provided specifies that CVE-2013-4152 was initially reported on August 22, 2013, and later updated on June 19, 2014 to clarify that the Spring MVC aspect of the vulnerability was split off into CVE-2013-7315.
