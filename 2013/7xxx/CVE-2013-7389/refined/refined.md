Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2013-7389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The D-Link DIR-645 router firmware has multiple vulnerabilities stemming from:

*   **Buffer overflows:** Improper handling of user-supplied input in several CGI scripts and a binary executable. Specifically, these occur in `post_login.xml`, `hedwig.cgi`, and `authentication.cgi`. These scripts copy user-controlled data into fixed-size buffers without proper bounds checking.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Inadequate input sanitization in `bind.php`, `info.php`, and `bsc_sms_send.php` allows injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflows:**
    *   The `post_login.xml` script processes a user-supplied "hash" parameter that is passed to the `/usr/sbin/widget` binary, which copies the hash into a static buffer without validation.
    *   The `hedwig.cgi` script is vulnerable to a buffer overflow via an overly long cookie value.
    *   The `authentication.cgi` script is vulnerable to a buffer overflow via the HTTP POST parameter "password".
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The `bind.php` script is vulnerable to XSS via the `deviceid` parameter.
    *   The `info.php` script is vulnerable to XSS via the `RESULT` parameter.
    *   The `bsc_sms_send.php` script is vulnerable to XSS via the `receiver` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Buffer Overflows:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can overwrite the saved program address or other critical memory locations, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the router.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overwriting memory could lead to crashes and unstable operation of the device.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Configuration Modification:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that can be used to read or change the router's configuration.
    *   **Malfunctioning/Instability:** The execution of malicious scripts can cause the router to malfunction or become unstable for the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated:** All identified vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely by unauthenticated attackers.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Exploits involve sending specially crafted HTTP requests to vulnerable CGI scripts or the `post_login.xml` endpoint.
    *   For buffer overflows: Attackers inject long strings via parameters such as "hash", cookie values or "password".
    *   For XSS: Attackers inject malicious scripts via specific parameters like "deviceid", "RESULT", or "receiver".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router. This typically implies network connectivity with the device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited without needing any authentication, making it easier for attackers to target vulnerable devices.
*   **Understanding of Vulnerable Endpoints:** Attackers need to know the specific vulnerable endpoints (`post_login.xml`, `hedwig.cgi`, `authentication.cgi`, `bind.php`, `info.php`, `bsc_sms_send.php`) to send malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**

* The advisory from roberto.greyhats.it provides specific proof-of-concept exploits using `curl` commands, demonstrating the simplicity of exploitation.
* D-Link released firmware version 1.04B11 to address these vulnerabilities.
* The original advisory includes details about the specific memory locations overwritten during exploitation (e.g., %ra).
* The advisory explicitly states that the issues were found by Roberto Paleari.

In summary, the identified vulnerabilities are serious, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to gain control of the device. This analysis provides details about the root causes, weaknesses, impacts, attack vectors and attacker capabilities based on the provided information, which is consistent with the description of CVE-2013-7389.
