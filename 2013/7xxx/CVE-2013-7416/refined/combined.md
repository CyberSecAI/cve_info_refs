Use CVE-2013-7416.

One might also argue that the underlying problem is that
doc/configuration in the Canto distribution tells users to enter
link_handler lines with " quoting, e.g.,

  link_handler("elinks \"%u\"", text=True)

within the user's ~/.canto/conf.py file. This perhaps could have been
addressed either by making the %u value safe before conf.py is
executed, or by telling the user to add other Python code to conf.py
for correct quoting.

In other words, 731582 is a valid vulnerability report because the
reporter is using a quoting approach that exactly matches the vendor's
recommendation. This is not a site-specific report about an error in
one user's ~/.canto/conf.py file.

2817869f98c54975f31e2dd674c1aefa70749cca adds an shlex.quote call --
shlex.quote is found in
<https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Lib/shlex.py> and has:

   return "'" + s.replace("'", "'\"'\"'") + "'"

# CVE request: Canto Feed URL Parsing Command Line Injection

*From*: Henri Salo <henri () nerv fi>

```
Can I get 2013 CVE for Canto feed URL parsing command line injection
vulnerability, thanks.

Project website: <http://codezen.org/canto-ng/>
Affected versions: All versions prior to v0.9.0
Debian version affected: 0.7.10-4
Canto was later removed from Debian. Versions 0.7.10-4 (wheezy) and 0.7.9-1
(squeeze) are not affected with this payload.
Upstream fix:
<https://github.com/themoken/canto-curses/commit/2817869f98c54975f31e2dd674c1aefa70749cca>
PoCs attached from the original advisory email.
OSVDB: <http://osvdb.org/101335>

Reported in Debian BTS <https://bugs.debian.org/731582> by
<the_walrus_88 () manlymail net>. Quoting the mail:

"""
I have just found a command line injection security vuln in
canto. The program fetches feeds from configured sites, and the
feeds contain URLs that people may want to visit. If a user
starts canto and chooses to go to one URL from one feed, canto
constructs a sh command line to visit the URL, but it doesn't
remove metachars. Therefore a malicious feed (owner turned bad,
man in the middle attack if fetched with http) can put in bad
data in all link and guid elements of the feed and use this to
hack the user when they visit some of the URLs. Not good. See my
conf.py and evil.rss files for an example. Sorry for my English!

Dear Maintainer,

I have just found a command line injection security vuln in
canto. The program fetches feeds from configured sites, and the
feeds contain URLs that people may want to visit. If a user
starts canto and chooses to go to one URL from one feed, canto
constructs a sh command line to visit the URL, but it doesn't
remove metachars. Therefore a malicious feed (owner turned bad,
man in the middle attack if fetched with http) can put in bad
data in all link and guid elements of the feed and use this to
hack the user when they visit some of the URLs. Not good. See my
conf.py and evil.rss files for an example. Sorry for my English!

Thanks for the report, I confirm that using evil.rss creates a /tmp/1337
file when trying to launch the url in a browser. It doesn't seem to be
fixed upstream.

Thanks,
