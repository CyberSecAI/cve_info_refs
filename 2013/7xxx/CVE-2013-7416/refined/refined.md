Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7416:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability in the Canto RSS feed reader. When a user selects a URL from a feed, Canto constructs a shell command to open the URL. However, Canto fails to sanitize or properly quote the URL, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands via a maliciously crafted RSS feed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of URLs before passing them to the shell. This allows an attacker to insert shell metacharacters (e.g., `&`, `;`, `|`) into a URL, which the shell will interpret as commands.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The application's documentation suggested using double quotes in the `link_handler` configuration, which doesn't prevent command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the user running Canto.
- **System Compromise:** This could potentially lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious RSS Feed:** The primary attack vector is a malicious or compromised RSS feed containing crafted URLs with shell metacharacters.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** If feeds are fetched over HTTP, a man-in-the-middle attacker could alter the feed content to include malicious URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Feed Control:**  The attacker must have control over an RSS feed that the victim uses in Canto.
- **No user interaction is required** other than the user clicking on the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of Canto prior to v0.9.0.
- The fix involves using `shlex.quote` to properly escape the URL before passing it to the shell. This prevents the shell from interpreting any metacharacters as commands, effectively stopping command injection.
- The vulnerability was reported in Debian as bug #731582.
- The application's documentation itself led users to implement an unsafe configuration.
