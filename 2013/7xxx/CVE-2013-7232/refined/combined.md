### Summary

This patch addresses security vulnerabilities that affect ArcGIS 10.2 for Server. It is recommended that all ArcGIS Server customers apply this patch immediately.

### Description

EsriÂ® announces the ArcGIS 10.2 for Server Security Patch (September 2013). This patch addresses a persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability that requires administrative access in order to exploit. For further details please read the knowledge base article 41468.

This patch also addresses a vulnerability that allows authenticated administrators to upload any type of file including potentially unsafe files.

This patch also provides a new security option for administrators. ArcGIS for Server allows tokens to be acquired through HTTP GET requests. This patch provides a new option to only grant tokens when an HTTP POST is used. HTTP GET requests expose credentials in the request URL in plain text format which may be stored in browser history or in network components. To learn more about this feature and how to activate it, please see the following help topics:

* [Disabling token acquisition through HTTP GET requests](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//015400000696000000) (Windows)
* [Disabling token acquisition through HTTP GET requests](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//01550000069v000000) (Linux)

Finally the patch addresses a SQL-injection vulnerability that affects ArcGIS for Server deployments with relational databases such as SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, or Informix. The SQL-injection vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of data. It deals specifically with the issues listed below under [Issues Addressed with this Patch](#bugs).

### Issues Addressed with this Patch

* NIM092795 - The File Upload Filter for mobile content directories should block an upload of unwanted file types.
* NIM092820 - The Mobile Content Directory in ArcGIS Server 10.1 SP1 has persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities.
* NIM092841 - Add a configurable property to the ArcGIS token service that disables support for HTTP GET.
* NIM094447 - There is a SQL injection vulnerability in map and feature services that allows unauthorized modification of data.
* NIM094481 - When StandardizedQueries is True, a map service's query operation ignores the definition expression set on the layer in the source map document when outStatistics gets used.
* NIM097252 - Asking for the extent of a 10.x fileGDB or SDE feature class after copy and paste returns none even if features exist.
