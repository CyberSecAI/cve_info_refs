Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerabilities addressed by the ArcGIS 10.2 for Server Security Patch (September 2013):

**1. Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** A persistent XSS vulnerability exists within the Mobile Content Directory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability allows injection of malicious scripts that are stored and executed when other users access the affected part of the application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the browser of a user accessing the application, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  An attacker could potentially inject malicious javascript code that gets stored and is executed when a victim visits the affected page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires administrative access to exploit.

**2. Unrestricted File Upload**

*   **Root Cause:** The system does not properly filter file uploads allowing authenticated administrators to upload any type of file.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper file type validation which could allow upload of malicious files, including executable or otherwise unsafe files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers could upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) and execute them on the server, potentially gaining control of the server or the web application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** File upload functionality accessible to authenticated administrators.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires authenticated administrator privileges.

**3. SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** A SQL injection vulnerability in map and feature services.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within SQL queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing unauthorized modification of data, or could lead to exfiltration of database contents.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities within the map and feature services.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No specific attacker capabilities or position are mentioned, but it implies access to map and feature services are necessary to trigger the vulnerability.

**4. HTTP GET token exposure**
*   **Root Cause:** ArcGIS for Server allows tokens to be acquired through HTTP GET requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Exposing sensitive credentials via URL, leading to potential storage in browser history or network components.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** If an attacker gains access to the request URL they may gain access to sensitive tokens.
*  **Attack Vectors:**  HTTP GET requests.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker who can capture/access network traffic or browser history might be able to access tokens.
