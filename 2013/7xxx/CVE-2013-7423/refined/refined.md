Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-7423:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `getaddrinfo()` function in glibc incorrectly handles file descriptors under high load. Specifically, it starts sending DNS queries to random file descriptors instead of the intended ones. This indicates a flaw in how `getaddrinfo()` manages or reuses file descriptors when performing DNS lookups under concurrent operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incorrect File Descriptor Usage**: The core vulnerability is that DNS queries are being written to the wrong file descriptors, potentially leading to data corruption, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Race condition/Concurrency issues**: The vulnerability is triggered under high load conditions, indicating a concurrency issue or race condition within the implementation of `getaddrinfo()`.
*   **Socket Caching Issue (Possible):** Some comments suggest that the problem might be related to how glibc's resolver caches sockets.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  DNS queries might be sent to unintended recipients, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Data Corruption:**  Writing DNS queries to unrelated sockets connected to other services could lead to corrupted data on those remote services.
*   **Denial of Service:** The improper handling of file descriptors could lead to an application crash or hang. In some cases (e.g. Exim) it can lead to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is to trigger a high load on the system while performing name resolutions using `getaddrinfo()`. This could be done locally, or remotely if a service is using `getaddrinfo` to resolve an attacker controlled hostname.
*   The provided code snippets in the sourceware bug report, demonstrate how to trigger the issue. The steps involve filling up file descriptors and concurrently calling `getaddrinfo()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker must have the ability to generate enough concurrent DNS resolution requests to trigger the improper file descriptor usage within `getaddrinfo()`.

**Additional notes:**

*   The issue is described as being present in multiple versions of glibc, including versions 2.6.11, 2.13, 2.17, and 2.18. The fix was introduced in glibc 2.20.
*   The vulnerability was initially reported on the sourceware bugzilla site.
*   The issue affects applications, possibly written in various languages, which utilize the vulnerable glibc function, `getaddrinfo()`, to resolve host names under high concurrency.
*   The bug can be triggered in highly concurrent scenarios, which may be easily reproducible in environments using Docker or similar container technologies, where many short-lived containers are spun up concurrently.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in several Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions and Ubuntu releases by applying a patch and updating the `glibc` packages.
*   A related bug report on openSUSE indicates the issue affects `glibc` versions older than `2.21-r2`.
*   The vulnerability is also described as related to a general class of issues where sockets get reused in unexpected ways leading to a vulnerability.
*   There's mention of a `__check_pf` netlink socket being a potential target for the out-of-bounds DNS queries, with SELinux reporting issues if this occurs.

Overall, CVE-2013-7423 is a serious vulnerability in `getaddrinfo()` that can lead to various impacts depending on how the affected application utilizes network resources, particularly under high load conditions.
