Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2013-7375:

**Summary:**

The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in PHP-Fusion 7.02.05, including SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion (LFI), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  While the CVE description is a placeholder, the extracted content clearly identifies the vulnerabilities and their root causes.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection in `includes/classes/Authenticate.class.php` (Authentication Bypass)**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `$_COOKIE[COOKIE_USER]` and `$_COOKIE[COOKIE_ADMIN]` values.  The `userID` obtained from these cookies is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper escaping.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation/sanitization, direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can craft malicious cookies to bypass authentication, log in as any user (including administrator) and gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `COOKIE_USER` or `COOKIE_ADMIN` HTTP cookies.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to craft and send HTTP requests with modified cookies. `magic_quotes_gpc` needs to be off.
    *   **Additional Details:** The proof of concept uses a crafted SQL injection within the cookie data to bypass authentication.

2.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI) in `maincore.php`**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `user_theme` POST parameter. The `stripinput()` function doesn't prevent directory traversal or null-byte injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate input sanitization, allowing directory traversal (`../`) and null byte termination (`\0`) in user-supplied data.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a malicious payload as a profile picture and using directory traversal in the `user_theme` parameter. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a malicious POST request to the user profile update form with a crafted `user_theme` parameter containing directory traversal characters and a null byte.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Valid user login. The "Allow users to change theme" option must be enabled, and PHP < 5.3.4 to exploit null byte.
     *  **Additional Details:**  The vulnerability leverages the way themes are loaded by the application, making it possible to include a file from an arbitrary path.

3.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI) in `administration/user_fields.php`**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `enable` GET parameter. The `stripinput()` function is not effective against directory traversal and null-byte injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate input sanitization, directory traversal, null byte termination.
    *  **Impact:** Arbitrary file inclusion, potentially leading to RCE if a malicious file is included.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request with the malicious payload to `administration/user_fields.php`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Administrator access with user field administration privileges. PHP < 5.3.4 for null byte exploit.

4. **SQL Injection in `downloads.php`**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `orderby` GET parameter. The `stripinput()` function does not prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted `orderby` GET parameter in `downloads.php`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Valid download category with at least one download.

5. **SQL Injection in `forum/postedit.php`**
    *  **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of the `delete_attach_*` POST parameters.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation, direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
    *  **Impact:** SQL injection.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Crafting a POST request with a malicious `delete_attach_*` parameter.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Logged in user with forum posting privileges.  `magic_quotes_gpc=off`.

6. **SQL Injection in `forum/postnewthread.php`**
    *   **Root Cause:** Uninitialized variable `$poll_opts` used in SQL query.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Uninitialized variables, direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a POST request with a malicious `poll_opts[]` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Logged in user with poll creation privileges,  available forum with poll creation abilities, `magic_quotes_gpc=off`, `register_globals=on`.

7. **SQL Injection in `administration/settings_messages.php`**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of `pm_email_notify`, `pm_save_sent`, `pm_inbox`, `pm_sentbox`, `pm_savebox` POST parameters.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a POST request with malicious parameters to the settings page.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Administrator access with private message settings change privileges, `magic_quotes_gpc=off`.

8.  **SQL Injection in `administration/settings_photo.php`**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization of `thumb_compression`, `photo_watermark_text_color1`, `photo_watermark_text_color2`, and `photo_watermark_text_color3` POST parameters. A flawed regex allows for SQL injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries, flawed regex.
    *  **Impact:** SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a POST request with malicious parameters to photo gallery settings.
