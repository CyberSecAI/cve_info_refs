Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2013-7382:

**CVE-2013-7382 is UNRELATED.**

The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in VICIDIAL, specifically:
  *   **Pre-Auth SQL Injection:** This vulnerability is in `SCRIPT_multirecording_AJAX.php`, and is assigned **CVE-2013-4467.**
  *   **Command Injection:** This is in `manager_send.php`, and is assigned **CVE-2013-4468.**
  *   **Hard-coded Credentials:** This involves the accounts VDAD and VDCL with password 'donotedit'. This is not assigned a CVE.

**CVE-2013-7382** itself is not mentioned in the provided content and appears to be a placeholder or incorrect assignment. However, the content does describe vulnerabilities in VICIDIAL that were assigned other CVEs.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on the **Command Injection** vulnerability because the exploit relies on the **SQL injection** to bypass authentication checks:

**Vulnerability:** Command Injection (CVE-2013-4468)

*   **Root Cause:** The `manager_send.php` script uses the `passthru()` function without sanitizing user-supplied input, specifically the `extension` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unsanitized input:** The `$extension` parameter is directly passed to the `passthru()` function, enabling command injection.
    *   **SQL Injection (CVE-2013-4467) for authentication bypass:**  The `server_ip` parameter in `manager_send.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection. By crafting a malicious `server_ip` value, an attacker can bypass the session check and gain access to the vulnerable command injection function. This SQL injection vulnerability exists in the line `SELECT count(*) from web_client_sessions where session_name='$session_name' and server_ip='$server_ip';`
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The presence of hardcoded user accounts (VDAD/donotedit and VDCL/donotedit) allows an attacker to bypass the authentication step to reach the vulnerable code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user (wwwrun in the example).
    *   **Complete system compromise:** With command execution, the attacker can potentially gain full control of the server, install malware, steal data, and perform other malicious activities.
    *   **Data breach:** An attacker may be able to gain access to sensitive information by reading files or accessing databases.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially crash or significantly degrade service.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack can be performed by crafting a malicious GET request to the `manager_send.php` script with specific parameter values, including the command to be injected in the `extension` parameter.
     *  **SQL Injection:** The attack uses the `server_ip` parameter for SQL injection which allows an attacker to bypass the session check.
      * **Hardcoded Credentials:** The attack uses credentials for `user` and `pass` as "VDCL" and "donotedit".

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the VICIDIAL server.
    *   **Knowledge of the vulnerabilities:** The attacker must be aware of the command injection and SQL injection vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.
    *   **VICIDIAL credentials:** While not strictly necessary due to the SQL injection bypass, having the hardcoded credentials (VDCL/donotedit) simplifies the exploit.
    *   **Session Creation:** At least one session must have been created at some point in time or the attacker needs to use  astGUIcient credentials in order to create one.

In summary, while the provided content does not pertain to **CVE-2013-7382**, it provides detailed information on a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2013-4468) in VICIDIAL, which, combined with a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2013-4467) and hardcoded credentials, could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. The content also explains how the described vulnerabilities were discovered and the vendor's response at the time.
