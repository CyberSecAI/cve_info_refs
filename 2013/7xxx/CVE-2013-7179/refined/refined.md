Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')** within the Seowon Intech WiMAX SWU-9100 mobile router. Specifically, the router's web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the `ping_ipaddr` parameter in the `diagnostic.cgi` script, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection (CWE-77):** The primary vulnerability is that the router executes commands based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the router's operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device. This can result in:
    *   Full compromise of the device.
    *   Potential data exfiltration.
    *   Denial of service (DoS).
    *   Malware installation or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the router.
*   An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `diagnostic.cgi` script. The `ping_ipaddr` parameter within this request is injected with operating system commands, which the vulnerable web script then executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the router's web interface. This could be via a local network (LAN) or potentially via the WAN interface if it is not properly firewalled.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this command injection vulnerability. The vulnerability is accessible without prior authentication.

**Technical details:**
The proof-of-concept provided shows how to inject commands using the ping functionality.
```
curl -v --data "select_mode_ping=on&ping_ipaddr=127.0.0.1>/dev/null; ls -lash /etc%23&ping_count=1&action=Apply&html_view=ping" "http://[IP_Router]/cgi-bin/diagnostic.cgi" > /dev/null
```
This command injects the command `ls -lash /etc` which lists the files in `/etc` directory on the device, using the ping functionality and redirects the output to `/dev/null`, thus hiding the output of the ping and the injected command, making it silent.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided CVSS score (8.3 Base) indicates a high severity vulnerability due to the potential for complete compromise of the device.
