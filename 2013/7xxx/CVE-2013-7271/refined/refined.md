    },
    "Technical Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is due to improperly initialized `msg_name` and `msg_namelen` message header parameters in the socket layer when using the `recvmsg(2)` or `recvfrom(2)` system calls. This leads to an information leak from kernel memory.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Information Leakage"
      ],
      "Impact": "An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Local Access",
        "System calls"
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": "Unprivileged local user access.",
       "Additional Details": "This vulnerability affects various socket families including ISDN, apple talk, ipx, netrom, packet and x25 protocols."
