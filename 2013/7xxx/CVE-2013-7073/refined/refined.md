Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of permission checks within the "Content Editing Wizards" component of TYPO3. Specifically, it fails to validate user permissions when accessing table columns.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Authenticated editors can read data from arbitrary TYPO3 table columns they should not have access to. This is achieved by manipulating URL parameters.
*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the absence of proper authorization checks when accessing data through the content editing wizards.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers with valid editor credentials can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database. This could expose data that editors are not supposed to view, but the data cannot be updated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers need to craft specific URL parameters to access the desired data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Editor Access:** An attacker needs valid login credentials for a TYPO3 editor account to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of TYPO3 Structure:** The attacker needs some understanding of the TYPO3 table structure and how URL parameters can be manipulated to retrieve data.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity.
*   The affected versions of TYPO3 are 4.5.0 through 4.5.31, 4.7.0 through 4.7.16, 6.0.0 through 6.0.11, and 6.1.0 through 6.1.6, and the development branch of 6.2
*   The fix involves updating to TYPO3 versions 4.5.32, 4.7.17, 6.0.12, or 6.1.7.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Georg Ringer, a member of the TYPO3 Security Team.

**CVSS v2 Score:**

*   AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:N

This translates to:

*   **Access Vector:** Network (N)
*   **Access Complexity:** Low (L)
*   **Authentication:** Single (S)
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Complete (C)
*   **Integrity Impact:** None (N)
*   **Availability Impact:** None (N)
