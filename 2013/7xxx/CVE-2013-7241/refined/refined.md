Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7241:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `mergedRSS.php` file where the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable is used in the `<atom:link>` tag within the generated XML. This variable is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code by manipulating the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable when constructing the XML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the RSS feed. When a user views the crafted feed, this code can be executed in their browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Stealing cookies/session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the web page.
    *   Other actions as dictated by the injected malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through manipulating the URL that is used to access the RSS feed. By injecting malicious code into the URL, the attacker can control the `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` variable, which is then reflected in the generated RSS XML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL that can be used to access the vulnerable RSS feed.
*   The attacker does not need any special permissions to exploit this vulnerability.
