Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2013-7402:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause lies in multiple flaws within the parsing logic of ICAP requests in the `c-icap` server. Specifically, the identified issues relate to how the server handles malformed or incomplete ICAP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper input validation:** The c-icap server doesn't properly validate the ICAP request structure. It may not check for the presence of mandatory elements like a space or a question mark in the request. 
- **Buffer Overflow (Potential):** When a buffer does not contain a space or question mark, a pointer used in the `parse_request()` function can increment beyond the allocated memory for the buffer.
- **Crash on malformed requests**:  The server was prone to crashing when encountering invalid ICAP requests, particularly those with incorrect method names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send specially crafted, invalid ICAP requests to the server, causing it to crash. This effectively denies service to legitimate users relying on the `c-icap` server.
- **Unspecified Impacts:** The advisories also mention other unspecified impacts, suggesting other potential consequences beyond simple crashes, although these aren't detailed in the provided text.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attacks:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, via the network.
- **Malformed ICAP Requests:** Attackers send malicious ICAP requests to the server, crafted to trigger the parsing issues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to the network port where the `c-icap` service is listening.
- **ICAP knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the ICAP protocol to craft malicious requests.
- **No Authentication Required**: The provided information does not indicate that any authentication is required to send the malicious requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for CVE-2013-7402 was introduced in `c-icap` commits `r1018` and `r1021` and addresses the multiple parsing issues.
- The information indicates the issue was resolved in `c-icap` versions 1:0.1.6-1.1+deb7u1 for Debian Wheezy, and 1:0.3.1-1 for Debian Jessie and Sid, as well as c-icap-0.2.6-2.2.mga4 in Mageia 4.
-  The vulnerability can be triggered by sending invalid ICAP requests such as those with invalid method names
