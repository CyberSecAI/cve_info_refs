How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Use CVE-2013-7401 for this specific issue discovered by Peter

```

Use CVE-2013-7402 for the chtsanti discoveries, i.e., the other issues
in the pre-r1018 code that made a remote crash possible. This might,
for example, include attack vectors with invalid method names.

There is no CVE ID for the <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/code/1021>
issue. This seems to be a usability problem that was introduced by the
first version of the security fixes.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14153#c0)  David Walser    2014-09-23 18:38:00 CEST  ``` Gentoo has issued an advisory on September 19: <http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-201409-07.xml>  According to Gentoo it was fixed upstream in 0.2.6, so only Mageia 3 is affected.  Reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=14153#c1)  David Walser    2014-09-23 18:39:33 CEST  ``` According to the Gentoo bug, it actually wasn't yet fixed upstream in 0.2.6, they had backported an additional patch: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=455324>  So Mageia 4 would also be affected. ```  ---   Version: 3 => 4Whiteboard: (none) => MGA3TOO  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14153#c2)  David Walser    2014-10-03 23:38:54 CEST  ``` The patch Gentoo added only fixes CVE-2013-7401: <http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/net-proxy/c-icap/files/c-icap-0.2.6-fix-icap-parsing.patch?revision=1.1&view=markup>  CVE-2013-7402 is only fixed in 0.3.x, in these commits: <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/code/1018/> <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/code/1021/>  see this bug report for CVE-2013-7402: <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/bugs/59/>  I guess it could be updated to 0.3.x in Mageia 3 and Mageia 4 (and c-icap-modules-extra would need to be as well I would imagine).  If so, even Cauldron should be updated to the newest 0.3.4, as it contains a crasher fix: <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/news/>  Here's an osvdb advisory for CVE-2013-7401 and more info including a PoC: <http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/89304> <http://osvdb.org/ref/89/c-icap.txt> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=14153#c3)  David Walser    2014-12-13 22:12:24 CET  ``` Debian has issued an advisory for this on December 13: <https://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-3101>  Now I see that the two upstream commits that I linked in [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14153#c2) apply cleanly to 0.2.6 and fix both CVEs.  I guess I should have figured that out earlier...  Patched package uploaded for Mageia 4.  Removing Mageia 3 from the whiteboard due to EOL.  This package has been removed from Cauldron due to lack of response from the maintainer.  Advisory: ========================  Updated c-icap packages fix security vulnerabilities:  Several vulnerabilities were found in c-icap, which could allow a remote attacker to cause c-icap to crash, or have other, unspecified impacts (CVE-2013-7401, CVE-2013-7402).
