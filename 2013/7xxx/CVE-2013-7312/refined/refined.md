The provided content is related to CVE-2013-0149, as indicated in the "Other Information" section of the document, which explicitly mentions "CVE IDs: [CVE-2013-0149](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2013-0149)". Although the primary vulnerability note uses VU#229804, it is cross-referenced with CVE-2013-0149, and the vulnerability description matches.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The OSPF protocol specification does not require the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields in a Link State Advertisement (LSA) to match when a router receives the LSA. During routing table calculations, OSPF implementations only use the 'Link State ID' for lookups in the LSA database. This discrepancy allows attackers to inject malformed LSAs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-694: Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier:** The OSPF protocol utilizes the 'Link State ID' as a primary key for LSA lookups. Lack of uniqueness checks across other fields allows for the injection of duplicate or modified LSAs.
- The protocol's lack of specification for the consistency between "Link State ID" and "Advertising Router" fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Traffic Redirection:** An attacker can subvert the routing table of a victim router, causing traffic to be redirected through the attacker's controlled router, compromising the confidentiality of data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can cause routers to drop the entire routing table, leading to a denial of service by sending a crafted LSA. This can also be achieved by overwriting existing routes or clearing the OSPF database
- **Routing Table Corruption:** Crafted LSA can corrupt routing tables leading to traffic subversion or black holing

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending crafted/malformed OSPF Router LSAs (type-1) where the Link State ID and Router ID do not match.
- Spoofing a legitimate OSPF peer to send malicious LSAs.
- Sending the crafted Router LSA on an interface where an OSPF peer is already present.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have control of a router within the Autonomous System (AS), or the ability to inject traffic to an OSPF interface of a router.
- The attacker must be able to send OSPF link-state update (LSU) packets to a vulnerable router without filtering or authentication.
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the targeted router or have the ability to send packets to the router's OSPF interface.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is implementation-specific, meaning some vendors may be affected while others may not.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by enabling OSPF MD5 authentication, which ensures routers only accept LSAs with the correct authentication value, and by implementing access controls/firewall filters to limit access to OSPF interfaces.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) script using Scapy is included, demonstrating how to craft malicious LSAs.
