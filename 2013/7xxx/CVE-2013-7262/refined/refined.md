  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-provided time filter strings in the `msPostGISLayerSetTimeFilter` function when using PostGIS and WMS-Time. Specifically, single quotes (') and backslashes (\\) were not being properly handled in the time filter strings before being used in SQL queries.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary SQL code into the time filter clause of the query, which could lead to unintended data disclosure from the specified database table. However, direct execution of secondary SQL commands like 'delete' was not possible according to the description.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the WMS-Time parameter, which is provided in the GET request to the WMS server. The attack is triggered when the server interacts with a PostGIS database.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted WMS request with a malicious time parameter to a MapServer instance configured with WMS-Time, using a PostGIS data source, and where GetFeatureInfo output formats dump all attributes."
