## Description

[![@ef4](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/319282?v=4&size=48)](/ef4)[ef4](https://github.com/ef4)opened [on Sep 3, 2013](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile/issues/350#issue-18939823)

I spent some time auditing the crypto constructs for Seafile's encrypted repos, because I'd like to help make Seafile more secure and trustworthy. I found some significant problems.

An attacker who obtains a copy of the encrypted library without the key can:

* read the complete list of directory and file names.
* know the size of every file
* know which files share some of the same information
* see the history of who changed each file, when, and what byte ranges were altered

Furthermore, since the same initialization vector is reused for all chunks, the library is vulnerable to watermarking and known-plaintext attacks.

The first problem is straightforward to solve: encrypt all file and directory entries, not just the content chunks.

The second problem (predictable IVs) is not as easy to fix. To maintain seafile's existing deduplication and synchronization capabilities, you want deterministic encryption. But maintaining semantic secrecy with deterministic encryption is probably not possible.

As a practical improvement, you could use an HMAC of each chunk as its IV. This is still deterministic, but it would at least prevent chunks with the same prefix from sharing the same ciphertext prefix.

To achieve strong secrecy, Seafile would need to give up deterministic encryption. This can still provide reasonable reduplication and efficient sync, but it would require clients to maintain their own cached mapping from chunk sha1 sums to their encrypted identities. You may want to look at how the Tarsnap client does something similar.
