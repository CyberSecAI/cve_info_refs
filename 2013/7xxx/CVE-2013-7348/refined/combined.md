aio: prevent double free in ioctx\_allocioctx\_alloc() calls aio\_setup\_ring() to allocate a ring. If aio\_setup\_ring()
fails to do so it would call aio\_free\_ring() before returning, but
ioctx\_alloc() would call aio\_free\_ring() again causing a double free of
the ring.
This is easily reproducible from userspace.

drm/radeon/audio: correct ACR table
commit 3e71985f2439d8c4090dc2820e497e6f3d72dcff upstream.
The values were taken from the HDMI spec, but they assumed
exact x/1.001 clocks. Since we round the clocks, we also need
to calculate different N and CTS values.
Note that the N for 25.2/1.001 MHz at 44.1 kHz audio is out of
spec. Hopefully this mode is rarely used and/or HDMI sinks
tolerate overly large values of N.

In order to have any realistic chance of calculating proper

not just CTS. We still aim for the ideal N as specified in
the HDMI spec though.

aio: Fix a trinity splat
commit e34ecee2ae791df674dfb466ce40692ca6218e43 upstream.
aio kiocb refcounting was broken - it was relying on keeping track of
the number of available ring buffer entries, which it needs to do
anyways; then at shutdown time it'd wait for completions to be delivered
until the # of available ring buffer entries equalled what it was
initialized to.
Problem with that is that the ring buffer is mapped writable into
userspace, so userspace could futz with the head and tail pointers to
cause the kernel to see extra completions, and cause free\_ioctx() to
return while there were still outstanding kiocbs. Which would be bad.
Fix is just to directly refcount the kiocbs - which is more
straightforward, and with the new percpu refcounting code doesn't cost
us any cacheline bouncing which was the whole point of the original
scheme.
Also clean up ioctx\_alloc()'s error path and fix a bug where it wasn't
subtracting from aio\_nr if ioctx\_add\_table() failed.

ntp: Make periodic RTC update more reliable
commit a97ad0c4b447a132a322cedc3a5f7fa4cab4b304 upstream.
The current code requires that the scheduled update of the RTC happens
in the closest tick to the half of the second. This seems to be
difficult to achieve reliably. The scheduled work may be missing the
target time by a tick or two and be constantly rescheduled every second.
Relax the limit to 10 ticks. As a typical RTC drifts in the 11-minute
update interval by several milliseconds, this shouldn't affect the
overall accuracy of the RTC much.

elevator: Fix a race in elevator switching and md device initialization

This is caused by a race between md device initialization by multipathd and
shell script to switch the scheduler using sysfs.
- multipathd:
SyS\_ioctl -> do\_vfs\_ioctl -> dm\_ctl\_ioctl -> ctl\_ioctl -> table\_load
-> dm\_setup\_md\_queue -> blk\_init\_allocated\_queue -> elevator\_init
q->elevator = elevator\_alloc(q, e); // not yet initialized
- sh -c 'echo deadline > /sys/$DEVPATH/queue/scheduler':
elevator\_switch (in the call trace above)
struct elevator\_queue \*old = q->elevator;
q->elevator = elevator\_alloc(q, new\_e);
elevator\_exit(old); // lockup! (\*)
- multipathd: (cont.)
err = e->ops.elevator\_init\_fn(q); // init fails; q->elevator is modified
(\*) When del\_timer\_sync() is called, lock\_timer\_base() will loop infinitely
while timer->base == NULL. In this case, as timer will never initialized,
it results in lockup.
This patch introduces acquisition of q->sysfs\_lock around elevator\_init()
into blk\_init\_allocated\_queue(), to provide mutual exclusion between
initialization of the q->scheduler and switching of the scheduler.
This should fix this bugzilla:

iommu: Remove stack trace from broken irq remapping warning
commit 05104a4e8713b27291c7bb49c1e7e68b4e243571 upstream.
The warning for the irq remapping broken check in intel\_irq\_remapping.c is
pretty pointless. We need the warning, but we know where its comming from, the
stack trace will always be the same, and it needlessly triggers things like
Abrt. This changes the warning to just print a text warning about BIOS being
broken, without the stack trace, then sets the appropriate taint bit. Since we
automatically disable irq remapping, theres no need to contiue making Abrt jump
at this problem

iommu/vt-d: Fixed interaction of VFIO\_IOMMU\_MAP\_DMA with IOMMU address limits
commit f9423606ade08653dd8a43334f0a7fb45504c5cc upstream.
The BUG\_ON in drivers/iommu/intel-iommu.c:785 can be triggered from userspace via
VFIO by calling the VFIO\_IOMMU\_MAP\_DMA ioctl on a vfio device with any address
beyond the addressing capabilities of the IOMMU. The problem is that the ioctl code
calls iommu\_iova\_to\_phys before it calls iommu\_map. iommu\_map handles the case that
it gets addresses beyond the addressing capabilities of its IOMMU.
intel\_iommu\_iova\_to\_phys does not.
This patch fixes iommu\_iova\_to\_phys to return NULL for addresses beyond what the
IOMMU can handle. This in turn causes the ioctl call to fail in iommu\_map and
(correctly) return EFAULT to the user with a helpful warning message in the kernel
log.

After commit 09fc7d22b024692b2fe8a943b246de1af307132b (usb: musb: fix incorrect
usage of resource pointer), CPPI DMA driver on DaVinci DM6467 can't detect its
dedicated IRQ and so the MUSB IRQ is erroneously used instead. This is because
only 2 resources are passed to the MUSB driver from the DaVinci glue layer, so
fix this by always copying 3 resources (it's safe since a placeholder for the
3rd resource is always there) and passing 'pdev->num\_resources' instead of the
size of musb\_resources[] to platform\_device\_add\_resources().

[ 135.300005] Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception
This is because raid5d() can be running when the multi-thread
resources are changed via system. We see need to provide locking.
mddev->device\_lock is suitable, but we cannot simple call
alloc\_thread\_groups under this lock as we cannot allocate memory
while holding a spinlock.
So change alloc\_thread\_groups() to allocate and return the data
structures, then raid5\_store\_group\_thread\_cnt() can take the lock
while updating the pointers to the data structures.
This fixes a bug introduced in 3.12 and so is suitable for the 3.12.x
stable series.

mm: numa: return the number of base pages altered by protection changes
commit 72403b4a0fbdf433c1fe0127e49864658f6f6468 upstream.
Commit 0255d4918480 ("mm: Account for a THP NUMA hinting update as one
PTE update") was added to account for the number of PTE updates when
marking pages prot\_numa. task\_numa\_work was using the old return value
to track how much address space had been updated. Altering the return
value causes the scanner to do more work than it is configured or
documented to in a single unit of work.
This patch reverts that commit and accounts for the number of THP
updates separately in vmstat. It is up to the administrator to
interpret the pair of values correctly. This is a straight-forward
operation and likely to only be of interest when actively debugging NUMA
balancing problems.
The impact of this patch is that the NUMA PTE scanner will scan slower
when THP is enabled and workloads may converge slower as a result. On
the flip size system CPU usage should be lower than recent tests
reported. This is an illustrative example of a short single JVM specjbb
test

Performance is similar but note the reduction in system CPU time. While
this showed a performance gain, it will not be universal but at least
it'll be behaving as documented. The vmstats are obviously different but

xfs: add capability check to free eofblocks ioctl
commit 8c567a7fab6e086a0284eee2db82348521e7120c upstream.
Check for CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN since the caller can truncate preallocated
blocks from files they do not own nor have write access to. A more
fine grained access check was considered: require the caller to
specify their own uid/gid and to use inode\_permission to check for
write, but this would not catch the case of an inode not reachable
via path traversal from the callers mount namespace.
Add check for read-only filesystem to free eofblocks ioctl.

xfrm: Fix null pointer dereference when decoding sessions
[ Upstream commit 84502b5ef9849a9694673b15c31bd3ac693010ae ]
On some codepaths the skb does not have a dst entry
when xfrm\_decode\_session() is called. So check for
a valid skb\_dst() before dereferencing the device
interface index. We use 0 as the device index if
there is no valid skb\_dst(), or at reverse decoding
we use skb\_iif as device interface index.
Bug was introduced with git commit bafd4bd4dc
("xfrm: Decode sessions with output interface.").

{pktgen, xfrm} Update IPv4 header total len and checksum after tranformation
[ Upstream commit 3868204d6b89ea373a273e760609cb08020beb1a ]
commit a553e4a6317b2cfc7659542c10fe43184ffe53da ("[PKTGEN]: IPSEC support")
tried to support IPsec ESP transport transformation for pktgen, but acctually
this doesn't work at all for two reasons(The orignal transformed packet has
bad IPv4 checksum value, as well as wrong auth value, reported by wireshark)
- After transpormation, IPv4 header total length needs update,
because encrypted payload's length is NOT same as that of plain text.
- After transformation, IPv4 checksum needs re-caculate because of payload
has been changed.
With this patch, armmed pktgen with below cofiguration, Wireshark is able to
decrypted ESP packet generated by pktgen without any IPv4 checksum error or
auth value error.

Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
This is because the macro operations in smc91x.h defined
for Versatile are missing SMC\_outsw() as used in this
commit.
The Versatile needs and uses the same accessors as the other
platforms in the first if(...) clause, just switch it to using
that and we have one problem less to worry about.
This includes a hunk of a patch from Will Deacon fixin
the other 32bit platforms as well: Innokom, Ramses, PXA,
PCM027.
Checkpatch complains about spacing, but I have opted to
follow the style of this .h-file.

When a skb has frags, bytes\_compl plus skb->len nr\_frags times in cp\_tx().
It's not the correct value(actually, it should plus skb->len once) and it
will trigger the BUG\_ON(bytes\_compl > num\_queued - dql->num\_completed).
So only increase bytes\_compl when finish sending all frags. pkts\_compl also
has a wrong value, fix it too.
It's introduced by commit 871f0d4c ("8139cp: enable bql").

Windows driver will enable ALDPS function, but linux driver and firmware
do not have any configuration related to ALDPS function for 8168g.
So restart system to linux and remove the NIC cable, LAN enter ALDPS,
then LAN RX will be disabled.
This issue can be easily reproduced on dual boot windows and linux
system with RTL\_GIGA\_MAC\_VER\_40 chip.
Realtek said, ALDPS function can be disabled by configuring to PHY,

via-velocity: fix netif\_receive\_skb use in irq disabled section.
[ Upstream commit bc9627e7e918a85e906c1a3f6d01d9b8ef911a96 ]
2fdac010bdcf10a30711b6924612dfc40daf19b8 ("via-velocity.c: update napi
implementation") overlooked an irq disabling spinlock when the Rx part
of the NAPI poll handler was converted from netif\_rx to netif\_receive\_skb.
NAPI Rx processing can be taken out of the locked section with a pair of
napi\_{disable / enable} since it only races with the MTU change function.
An heavier rework of the NAPI locking would be able to perform NAPI Tx
before Rx where I simply removed one of velocity\_tx\_srv calls.

sch\_tbf: handle too small burst

If a too small burst is inadvertently set on TBF, we might trigger

Fix the bug, and add a warning, as such configuration is not
going to work anyway for non GSO packets.
(For some reason, one has to use a burst >= 1520 to get a working
configuration, even with old kernels. This is a probable iproute2/tc
bug)

gro: Only verify TCP checksums for candidates
[ Upstream commit cc5c00bbb44c5d68b883aa5cb9d01514a2525d94 ]
In some cases we may receive IP packets that are longer than
their stated lengths. Such packets are never merged in GRO.
However, we may end up computing their checksums incorrectly
and end up allowing packets with a bogus checksum enter our
stack with the checksum status set as verified.
Since such packets are rare and not performance-critical, this
patch simply skips the checksum verification for them.

gso: handle new frag\_list of frags GRO packets
[ Upstream commit 9d8506cc2d7ea1f911c72c100193a3677f6668c3 ]
Recently GRO started generating packets with frag\_lists of frags.
This was not handled by GSO, thus leading to a crash.
Thankfully these packets are of a regular form and are easy to
handle. This patch handles them in two ways. For completely
non-linear frag\_list entries, we simply continue to iterate over
the frag\_list frags once we exhaust the normal frags. For frag\_list
entries with linear parts, we call pskb\_trim on the first part
of the frag\_list skb, and then process the rest of the frags in
the usual way.
This patch also kills a chunk of dead frag\_list code that has
obviously never ever been run since it ends up generating a bogus
GSO-segmented packet with a frag\_list entry.
Future work is planned to split super big packets into TSO
ones.

packet: fix use after free race in send path when dev is released
[ Upstream commit e40526cb20b5ee53419452e1f03d97092f144418 ]
Salam reported a use after free bug in PF\_PACKET that occurs when
we're sending out frames on a socket bound device and suddenly the
net device is being unregistered. It appears that commit 827d9780
introduced a possible race condition between {t,}packet\_snd() and
packet\_notifier(). In the case of a bound socket, packet\_notifier()
can drop the last reference to the net\_device and {t,}packet\_snd()
might end up suddenly sending a packet over a freed net\_device.
To avoid reverting 827d9780 and thus introducing a performance
regression compared to the current state of things, we decided to
hold a cached RCU protected pointer to the net device and maintain
it on write side via bind spin\_lock protected register\_prot\_hook()
and \_\_unregister\_prot\_hook() calls.
In {t,}packet\_snd() path, we access this pointer under rcu\_read\_lock
through packet\_cached\_dev\_get() that holds reference to the device
to prevent it from being freed through packet\_notifier() while
we're in send path. This is okay to do as dev\_put()/dev\_hold() are
per-cpu counters, so this should not be a performance issue. Also,
the code simplifies a bit as we don't need need\_rls\_dev anymore.

The reason is that when the bridge dev's address is changed, the

the bridge was removed, the address entry in the fdb did not free,
the bridge\_fdb\_cache still has objects when destroy the cache, Fix
this by flushing the bridge address entry when removing the bridge.
v2: according to the Toshiaki Makita and Vlad's suggestion, I only
delete the vlan0 entry, it still have a leak here if the vlan id
is other number, so I need to call fdb\_delete\_by\_port(br, NULL, 1)
to flush all entries whose dst is NULL for the bridge.

net: core: Always propagate flag changes to interfaces
[ Upstream commit d2615bf450694c1302d86b9cc8a8958edfe4c3a4 ]
The following commit:
b6c40d68ff6498b7f63ddf97cf0aa818d748dee7
net: only invoke dev->change\_rx\_flags when device is UP
tried to fix a problem with VLAN devices and promiscuouse flag setting.
The issue was that VLAN device was setting a flag on an interface that
was down, thus resulting in bad promiscuity count.
This commit blocked flag propagation to any device that is currently
down.
A later commit:
deede2fabe24e00bd7e246eb81cd5767dc6fcfc7
vlan: Don't propagate flag changes on down interfaces
fixed VLAN code to only propagate flags when the VLAN interface is up,
thus fixing the same issue as above, only localized to VLAN.
The problem we have now is that if we have create a complex stack
involving multiple software devices like bridges, bonds, and vlans,
then it is possible that the flags would not propagate properly to
the physical devices. A simple examle of the scenario is the
following:
eth0----> bond0 ----> bridge0 ---> vlan50
If bond0 or eth0 happen to be down at the time bond0 is added to
the bridge, then eth0 will never have promisc mode set which is
currently required for operation as part of the bridge. As a
result, packets with vlan50 will be dropped by the interface.
The only 2 devices that implement the special flag handling are
VLAN and DSA and they both have required code to prevent incorrect
flag propagation. As a result we can remove the generic solution
introduced in b6c40d68ff6498b7f63ddf97cf0aa818d748dee7 and leave
it to the individual devices to decide whether they will block
flag propagation or not.

ipv4: fix race in concurrent ip\_route\_input\_slow()
[ Upstream commit dcdfdf56b4a6c9437fc37dbc9cee94a788f9b0c4 ]
CPUs can ask for local route via ip\_route\_input\_noref() concurrently.
if nh\_rth\_input is not cached yet, CPUs will proceed to allocate
equivalent DSTs on 'lo' and then will try to cache them in nh\_rth\_input
via rt\_cache\_route()
Most of the time they succeed, but on occasion the following two lines:
orig = \*p;
prev = cmpxchg(p, orig, rt);
in rt\_cache\_route() do race and one of the cpus fails to complete cmpxchg.
But ip\_route\_input\_slow() doesn't check the return code of rt\_cache\_route(),
so dst is leaking. dst\_destroy() is never called and 'lo' device
refcnt doesn't go to zero, which can be seen in the logs as:
unregister\_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 1
Adding mdelay() between above two lines makes it easily reproducible.
Fix it similar to nh\_pcpu\_rth\_output case.

tcp: don't update snd\_nxt, when a socket is switched from repair mode
[ Upstream commit dbde497966804e63a38fdedc1e3815e77097efc2 ]
snd\_nxt must be updated synchronously with sk\_send\_head. Otherwise
tp->packets\_out may be updated incorrectly, what may bring a kernel panic.
Here is a kernel panic from my host.
[ 103.043194] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000048
[ 103.044025] IP: [] tcp\_rearm\_rto+0xcf/0x150
...
[ 146.301158] Call Trace:
[ 146.301158] [] tcp\_ack+0xcc0/0x12c0
Before this panic a tcp socket was restored. This socket had sent and
unsent data in the write queue. Sent data was restored in repair mode,
then the socket was switched from reapair mode and unsent data was
restored. After that the socket was switched back into repair mode.
In that moment we had a socket where write queue looks like this:
snd\_una snd\_nxt write\_seq
|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|
|
sk\_send\_head
After a second switching from repair mode the state of socket was
changed:
snd\_una snd\_nxt, write\_seq
|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|
|
sk\_send\_head
This state is inconsistent, because snd\_nxt and sk\_send\_head are not
synchronized.
Bellow you can find a call trace, how packets\_out can be incremented
twice for one skb, if snd\_nxt and sk\_send\_head are not synchronized.
In this case packets\_out will be always positive, even when
sk\_write\_queue is empty.
tcp\_write\_wakeup
skb = tcp\_send\_head(sk);
tcp\_fragment
if (!before(tp->snd\_nxt, TCP\_SKB\_CB(buff)->end\_seq))
tcp\_adjust\_pcount(sk, skb, diff);
tcp\_event\_new\_data\_sent
tp->packets\_out += tcp\_skb\_pcount(skb);
I think update of snd\_nxt isn't required, when a socket is switched from
repair mode. Because it's initialized in tcp\_connect\_init. Then when a
write queue is restored, snd\_nxt is incremented in tcp\_event\_new\_data\_sent,
so it's always is in consistent state.
I have checked, that the bug is not reproduced with this patch and
all tests about restoring tcp connections work fine.

netfilter: push reasm skb through instead of original frag skbs
[ Upstream commit 6aafeef03b9d9ecf255f3a80ed85ee070260e1ae ]
Pushing original fragments through causes several problems. For example
for matching, frags may not be matched correctly. Take following
example:
On HOSTA do:
ip6tables -I INPUT -p icmpv6 -j DROP
ip6tables -I INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmp6 --icmpv6-type 128 -j ACCEPT
and on HOSTB you do:
ping6 HOSTA -s2000 (MTU is 1500)
Incoming echo requests will be filtered out on HOSTA. This issue does
not occur with smaller packets than MTU (where fragmentation does not happen)

As was discussed previously, the only correct solution seems to be to use
reassembled skb instead of separete frags. Doing this has positive side
effects in reducing sk\_buff by one pointer (nfct\_reasm) and also the reams
dances in ipvs and conntrack can be removed.
Future plan is to remove net/ipv6/netfilter/nf\_conntrack\_reasm.c
entirely and use code in net/ipv6/reassembly.c instead.

net: rework recvmsg handler msg\_name and msg\_namelen logic
[ Upstream commit f3d3342602f8bcbf37d7c46641cb9bca7618eb1c ]
This patch now always passes msg->msg\_namelen as 0. recvmsg handlers must
set msg\_namelen to the proper size <= sizeof(struct sockaddr\_storage)
to return msg\_name to the user.
This prevents numerous uninitialized memory leaks we had in the
recvmsg handlers and makes it harder for new code to accidentally leak
uninitialized memory.
Optimize for the case recvfrom is called with NULL as address. We don't
need to copy the address at all, so set it to NULL before invoking the
recvmsg handler. We can do so, because all the recvmsg handlers must
cope with the case a plain read() is called on them. read() also sets
msg\_name to NULL.
Also document these changes in include/linux/net.h as suggested by David
Miller.
Changes since RFC:
Set msg->msg\_name = NULL if user specified a NULL in msg\_name but had a
non-null msg\_namelen in verify\_iovec/verify\_compat\_iovec. This doesn't
affect sendto as it would bail out earlier while trying to copy-in the
address. It also more naturally reflects the logic by the callers of
verify\_iovec.
With this change in place I could remove "
if (!uaddr || msg\_sys->msg\_namelen == 0)
msg->msg\_name = NULL
".
This change does not alter the user visible error logic as we ignore
msg\_namelen as long as msg\_name is NULL.
Also remove two unnecessary curly brackets in \_\_\_sys\_recvmsg and change
comments to netdev style.

pkt\_sched: fq: fix pacing for small frames
[ Upstream commit f52ed89971adbe79b6438c459814034707b8ab91 ]
For performance reasons, sch\_fq tried hard to not setup timers for every
sent packet, using a quantum based heuristic : A delay is setup only if
the flow exhausted its credit.
Problem is that application limited flows can refill their credit
for every queued packet, and they can evade pacing.
This problem can also be triggered when TCP flows use small MSS values,
as TSO auto sizing builds packets that are smaller than the default fq
quantum (3028 bytes)
This patch adds a 40 ms delay to guard flow credit refill.

connector: improved unaligned access error fix
[ Upstream commit 1ca1a4cf59ea343a1a70084fe7cc96f37f3cf5b1 ]
In af3e095a1fb4, Erik Jacobsen fixed one type of unaligned access
bug for ia64 by converting a 64-bit write to use put\_unaligned().
Unfortunately, since gcc will convert a short memset() to a series
of appropriately-aligned stores, the problem is now visible again
on tilegx, where the memset that zeros out proc\_event is converted
to three 64-bit stores, causing an unaligned access panic.
A better fix for the original problem is to ensure that proc\_event
is aligned to 8 bytes here. We can do that relatively easily by
arranging to start the struct cn\_msg aligned to 8 bytes and then
offset by 4 bytes. Doing so means that the immediately following
proc\_event structure is then correctly aligned to 8 bytes.
The result is that the memset() stores are now aligned, and as an
added benefit, we can remove the put\_unaligned() calls in the code.

sit: fix use after free of fb\_tunnel\_dev
[ Upstream commit 9434266f2c645d4fcf62a03a8e36ad8075e37943 ]
Bug: The fallback device is created in sit\_init\_net and assumed to be
freed in sit\_exit\_net. First, it is dereferenced in that function, in
sit\_destroy\_tunnels:
struct net \*net = dev\_net(sitn->fb\_tunnel\_dev);
Prior to this, rtnl\_unlink\_register has removed all devices that match
rtnl\_link\_ops == sit\_link\_ops.
Commit 205983c43700 added the line
+ sitn->fb\_tunnel\_dev->rtnl\_link\_ops = &sit\_link\_ops;
which cases the fallback device to match here and be freed before it
is last dereferenced.
Fix: This commit adds an explicit .delllink callback to sit\_link\_ops
that skips deallocation at rtnl\_unlink\_register for the fallback
device. This mechanism is comparable to the one in ip\_tunnel.
It also modifies sit\_destroy\_tunnels and its only caller sit\_exit\_net
to avoid the offending dereference in the first place. That double
lookup is more complicated than required.
Test: The bug is only triggered when CONFIG\_NET\_NS is enabled. It
causes a GPF only when CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SLAB is enabled. Verified that
this bug exists at the mentioned commit, at davem-net HEAD and at
3.11.y HEAD. Verified that it went away after applying this patch.

tcp: tsq: restore minimal amount of queueing
[ Upstream commit 98e09386c0ef4dfd48af7ba60ff908f0d525cdee ]
After commit c9eeec26e32e ("tcp: TSQ can use a dynamic limit"), several
users reported throughput regressions, notably on mvneta and wifi
adapters.
802.11 AMPDU requires a fair amount of queueing to be effective.
This patch partially reverts the change done in tcp\_write\_xmit()
so that the minimal amount is sysctl\_tcp\_limit\_output\_bytes.
It also remove the use of this sysctl while building skb stored
in write queue, as TSO autosizing does the right thing anyway.
Users with well behaving NICS and correct qdisc (like sch\_fq),
can then lower the default sysctl\_tcp\_limit\_output\_bytes value from
128KB to 8KB.
This new usage of sysctl\_tcp\_limit\_output\_bytes permits each driver
authors to check how their driver performs when/if the value is set
to a minimum of 4KB.
Normally, line rate for a single TCP flow should be possible,
but some drivers rely on timers to perform TX completion and
too long TX completion delays prevent reaching full throughput.

macvtap: limit head length of skb allocated
[ Upstream commit 16a3fa28630331e28208872fa5341ce210b901c7 ]
We currently use hdr\_len as a hint of head length which is advertised by
guest. But when guest advertise a very big value, it can lead to an 64K+
allocating of kmalloc() which has a very high possibility of failure when host
memory is fragmented or under heavy stress. The huge hdr\_len also reduce the
effect of zerocopy or even disable if a gso skb is linearized in guest.
To solves those issues, this patch introduces an upper limit (PAGE\_SIZE) of the
head, which guarantees an order 0 allocation each time.

6lowpan: Uncompression of traffic class field was incorrect
[ Upstream commit 1188f05497e7bd2f2614b99c54adfbe7413d5749 ]
If priority/traffic class field in IPv6 header is set (seen when
using ssh), the uncompression sets the TC and Flow fields incorrectly.
Example:
This is IPv6 header of a sent packet. Note the priority/TC (=1) in
the first byte.
00000000: 61 00 00 00 00 2c 06 40 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000010: 02 02 72 ff fe c6 42 10 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000020: 02 1e ab ff fe 4c 52 57
This gets compressed like this in the sending side
00000000: 72 31 04 06 02 1e ab ff fe 4c 52 57 ec c2 00 16
00000010: aa 2d fe 92 86 4e be c6 ....
In the receiving end, the packet gets uncompressed to this
IPv6 header
00000000: 60 06 06 02 00 2a 1e 40 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000010: 02 02 72 ff fe c6 42 10 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000020: ab ff fe 4c 52 57 ec c2
First four bytes are set incorrectly and we have also lost
two bytes from destination address.
The fix is to switch the case values in switch statement
when checking the TC field.

Since commit 7b0c5f21f348a66de495868b8df0284e8dfd6bbf
"sierra\_net: keep status interrupt URB active", sierra\_net triggers
status interrupt polling before the net\_device is opened (in order to
properly receive the sync message response).

random32: fix off-by-one in seeding requirement
[ Upstream commit 51c37a70aaa3f95773af560e6db3073520513912 ]
For properly initialising the Tausworthe generator [1], we have
a strict seeding requirement, that is, s1 > 1, s2 > 7, s3 > 15.
Commit 697f8d0348 ("random32: seeding improvement") introduced
a \_\_seed() function that imposes boundary checks proposed by the
errata paper [2] to properly ensure above conditions.
However, we're off by one, as the function is implemented as:
"return (x < m) ? x + m : x;", and called with \_\_seed(X, 1),
\_\_seed(X, 7), \_\_seed(X, 15). Thus, an unwanted seed of 1, 7, 15
would be possible, whereas the lower boundary should actually
be of at least 2, 8, 16, just as GSL does. Fix this, as otherwise
an initialization with an unwanted seed could have the effect
that Tausworthe's PRNG properties cannot not be ensured.
Note that this PRNG is \*not\* used for cryptography in the kernel.

ipv6: use rt6\_get\_dflt\_router to get default router in rt6\_route\_rcv
[ Upstream commit f104a567e673f382b09542a8dc3500aa689957b4 ]
As the rfc 4191 said, the Router Preference and Lifetime values in a
::/0 Route Information Option should override the preference and lifetime
values in the Router Advertisement header. But when the kernel deals with
a ::/0 Route Information Option, the rt6\_get\_route\_info() always return
NULL, that means that overriding will not happen, because those default
routers were added without flag RTF\_ROUTEINFO in rt6\_add\_dflt\_router().
In order to deal with that condition, we should call rt6\_get\_dflt\_router
when the prefix length is 0.

net: Fix "ip rule delete table 256"
[ Upstream commit 13eb2ab2d33c57ebddc57437a7d341995fc9138c ]
When trying to delete a table >= 256 using iproute2 the local table
will be deleted.
The table id is specified as a netlink attribute when it needs more then
8 bits and iproute2 then sets the table field to RT\_TABLE\_UNSPEC (0).
Preconditions to matching the table id in the rule delete code
doesn't seem to take the "table id in netlink attribute" into condition
so the frh\_get\_table helper function never gets to do its job when
matching against current rule.
Use the helper function twice instead of peaking at the table value directly.

Commit 1e2bd517c108816220f262d7954b697af03b5f9c ("udp6: Fix udp

there is enough space to include a fragment header in the skb from a
skb->mac\_header dervived one to skb\_headroom. Because we already peeled
off the skb to transport\_header this is wrong. Change this back to check
if we have enough room before the mac\_header.
This fixes a panic Saran Neti reported. He used the tbf scheduler which
skb\_gso\_segments the skb. The offsets get negative and we panic in memcpy
because the skb was erroneously not expanded at the head.

aio: prevent double free in ioctx\_alloc

```
ioctx_alloc() calls aio_setup_ring() to allocate a ring. If aio_setup_ring()
fails to do so it would call aio_free_ring() before returning, but
ioctx_alloc() would call aio_free_ring() again causing a double free of
the ring.

This is easily reproducible from userspace.
