{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "OS command injection in the UPnP SOAP interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind OS command injection vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary OS command execution on the target device. This can lead to complete compromise of the device, including establishing a telnet backdoor or deploying a malicious payload.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending crafted SOAP requests to the UPnP interface of vulnerable D-Link routers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router's UPnP service, usually on port 49152. The attacker can be on the same local network or potentially be remote depending on the router's configuration."
