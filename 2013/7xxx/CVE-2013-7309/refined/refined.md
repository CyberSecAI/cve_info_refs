The provided content is related to CVE-2013-7309, as it refers to the same vulnerability described by CVE-2013-0149, which is a duplicate ID of CVE-2013-7309.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The OSPF protocol does not enforce a requirement for the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields to match when a router receives a Link State Advertisement (LSA). During routing table calculation, LSAs are queried using only the Link State ID. This allows for the injection of malformed, duplicate LSA entries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694): The OSPF protocol uses the Link State ID as the primary lookup identifier in its database, while the complete LSA is identified by LS Type, Advertising Router, and Link State ID. This discrepancy allows for malicious LSA entries to be injected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Subversion of routing tables: An attacker can inject false LSAs that cause routers to re-route traffic.
- Denial of service: Malformed LSAs can cause routers to drop their routing tables, leading to DoS.
- Traffic interception: By controlling routing, an attacker can intercept and redirect network traffic, compromising confidentiality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending spoofed LSA packets: Attackers craft and send malicious LSAs to targeted routers. The crafted LSA must come from a source IP of an OSPF peer, or be sent in an interface where an OSPF peer is already present.
- Malformed LSA with mismatched Link State ID and Advertising Router: The attacker exploits the lack of validation of these fields, crafting a LSA with a false advertising router ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Control of a router within the Autonomous System (AS):  The attacker needs to have control over at least one router within the network to initiate this attack.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send OSPF packets to the targeted router, either via spoofing a legitimate OSPF peer or being on a network interface where an OSPF peer is present.
- Unfiltered access to an OSPF interface not using MD5 authentication is required for remote exploitation.
