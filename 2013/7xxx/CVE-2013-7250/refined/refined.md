The provided content is related to a commit in the `projectforge-webapp` repository that introduces HTML escaping in the `JsonBuilder` class. While this commit addresses a potential vulnerability by preventing unescaped HTML from being injected into JSON responses, it does not describe a vulnerability that can be associated with CVE-2013-7250. 

The commit introduces a new `escapeHtml` flag and logic to escape HTML characters (<, >, &, ", ', /) using HTML entities when this flag is enabled. This addresses a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the JSON output was rendered in an HTML context without proper escaping.

Specifically:
*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The code previously did not escape HTML characters when generating JSON strings which, if rendered in an HTML context, could lead to XSS.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of HTML escaping in the `JsonBuilder` class before the commit.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: If the JSON output was rendered in an HTML context without proper escaping, it would have allowed an attacker to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code, leading to XSS.
*  **Attack vectors**: An attacker could inject malicious script tags or other HTML via the data being added to the JSON output.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to control the data that is being converted to JSON.

The commit prevents this by adding explicit HTML escaping functionality.

Based on the analysis, this content does not describe the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-7250, however, it does describe a security fix that addresses the potential of XSS.

Therefore:
