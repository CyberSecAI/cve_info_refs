The provided content is related to CVE-2013-7306, which is actually CVE-2013-0149, as mentioned in the document.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The OSPF protocol does not enforce a match between the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields in Link State Advertisements (LSAs). During routing table calculations, the LSA database is queried using only the Link State ID. This allows an attacker to inject a malformed LSA with a different 'Advertising Router', causing routing table corruption or denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694).
- Lack of proper validation when looking up LSAs in the routing table calculation process, using only the Link State ID and not verifying if the Advertising Router matches.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Subversion of routing tables, leading to traffic rerouting and potential data confidentiality breaches.
- Denial of service attacks by dropping the entire routing table or rerouting all traffic to a black hole.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to cause traffic subversion or black hole attacks by sending crafted illegal OSPF router LSAs where the Link State ID and Router ID are not the same.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending false/malformed LSAs from a compromised router within the OSPF autonomous system (AS).
- Spoofing a legitimate OSPF peer's IP address to send the crafted Router LSA.
- Sending the crafted LSA on an interface where an OSPF peer already exists.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Control over a router within the target OSPF AS.
- Ability to craft and send OSPF LSAs to the victim router.
- The attacker needs to be an OSPF peer (or spoof one) and inject a malformed LSA.
