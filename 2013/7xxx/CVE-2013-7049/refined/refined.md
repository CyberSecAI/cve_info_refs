The content is related to CVE-2013-7049.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the FiSH plugin for ZNC, specifically in how it handles base64 encoded public keys during the initiation of a private conversation (query). The plugin decodes a base64 stream into a buffer without checking the bounds, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `b64toh` function in the FiSH plugin.
- Lack of bounds checking when decoding base64 encoded public keys.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Although stack cookies prevent direct code execution on x86 and x64 Windows builds, the buffer overflow causes an exception and crashes the ZNC daemon, leading to a DoS.
- The vulnerability exists in multiple implementations of the FiSH plugin.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted base64 encoded public key during the initiation of a new private query.
- Sending a long string of "A" characters after base64 encoding, prepended with "DH1080_INIT".
- Sending a notice to a user with a crafted string.
- Triggered by an attacker in a chat with a victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be able to send messages to a user using ZNC with the FiSH plugin enabled
- The attacker initiates a private query with a user that has the vulnerable FiSH plugin enabled.
- The attacker needs to send a specially crafted message containing an oversized base64 encoded string.
