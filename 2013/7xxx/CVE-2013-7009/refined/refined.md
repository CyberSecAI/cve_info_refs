Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-7009:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
The provided content directly addresses CVE-2013-7009, as indicated in the email thread where CVEs are being requested for FFmpeg 2.1 and the message from MITRE assigning this CVE ID to the specific commit.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2013-7009 is an out-of-bounds write on the heap within the rpza decoding function of FFmpeg. This is caused by insufficient checks during block processing which leads to writes beyond the allocated buffer.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds Write:** The vulnerability allows writing outside the allocated memory boundaries.
   - **Heap corruption:** Since the out-of-bounds write is on the heap it can lead to heap corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Memory corruption:** Writing beyond the boundaries corrupts heap memory. This can lead to application crashes
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated in the provided content, heap corruption vulnerabilities can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited strategically. This makes remote code execution a plausible, though not directly evidenced, impact.
   - **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds write and memory corruption can also cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition due to crashes.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious media file:** An attacker can craft a malicious media file (specifically an .mov file containing rpza encoded video) to trigger the vulnerability when processed by FFmpeg.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious media file to a system using FFmpeg. This could be through a user opening the file or via a service that uses FFmpeg to process media.
   - No special privileges are required.

**7. Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `rpza_decode_stream` function, specifically at the pointer arithmetic and index usage in the decoding loop.
*   The commit `3819db745da2ac7fb3faacb116788c32f4753f34` on GitHub shows the fix implemented in `libavcodec/rpza.c`. The fix involves adding checks and performing pointer advancements before using them.
*   The original code lacked checks and proper pointer advancements leading to block pointers (`block_ptr`) that go out of bounds.
*   The `ADVANCE_BLOCK()` macro was found to be unreliable leading to an invalid `pixel_ptr` calculation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing techniques as demonstrated by the valgrind output showing "Invalid write of size 2" within the `rpza_decode_stream` function at line 147 of `rpza.c`
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201603-06) lists CVE-2013-7009 among multiple vulnerabilities found in FFmpeg, reinforcing its potential for remote exploitation and associated risks, and providing a description of the broader context of the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2013-7009 arises from an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in FFmpeg's rpza decoder, caused by inadequate bounds checking of block pointers. This can be exploited via a crafted media file leading to a denial of service, memory corruption and potential arbitrary code execution.
