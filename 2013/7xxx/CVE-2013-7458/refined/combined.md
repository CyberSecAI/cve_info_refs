### @denisvm **[denisvm](/denisvm)** commented [Jun 16, 2016](#issue-160757527)

The default CLI history file (`.rediscli_history`) is being written with default user file creation mask, which makes the file readable by group and others. This type of file may contain sensible information and should not be world-readable.

Closes [#3284](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/3284)

Sorry, something went wrong.

```
Package: redis-tools
Version: 2.8.17-1+deb8u3
Severity: grave
Tags: security

redis-cli stores its history in ~/.rediscli_history, this file is
created with permissions 0644. Home folders are world readable as well
in debian, so any user can access other users redis history, including
AUTH commands, which include credentials.

I've contacted upstream on 2016-05-30 without any reaction at all and
discovered this bug was first reported 3 years ago, still unfixed.
@RedisLabs keeps referring to their paid support on twitter.

Demo: `cat /home/*/.rediscli_history`

Boo. Is there an upstream bug# for this or was this reported privately?

Indeed this looks like it might affect some other packages in Debian:

 <https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=int+linenoiseHistorySave&perpkg=1>

Can you check these? I'm about to get on a flight and won't be able to
work on this for perhaps 24h.

I can confirm the same bug is present in mongodb:

	cat /home/*/.dbshell

I'm looking into the other packages tomorrow.

# redis-cli: permissions when opening history file¬†#3284

## Description

[![@kpcyrd](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7763184?v=4&size=48)](/kpcyrd)[kpcyrd](https://github.com/kpcyrd)opened [on May 30, 2016](https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/3284#issue-157524025)

redis-cli saves it's history here:

<https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/8c4f4d12d856e57534277c1737d7cb07890bbe63/src/redis-cli.c#L1290>

and uses the linenoise library to fopen the file there:

<https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/e0eb5f6bbf2407c802a231594acb90aa7a6a8e9a/deps/linenoise/linenoise.c#L1163>

If the file does not exist, it's created with default umask 0022, so the file ends up with 0644. redis-cli writes it's history to `~` by default, which usually expands to a folder in /home, which is world accessible by default in a lot of distributions. This causes the file to be world readable.

You could either call umask to change the default permissions or pass appropriate permissions when creating, like bash does:

```
          file = open (hf, O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_WRONLY, 0600);

```

<http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/bashhist.c?id=ae339e9c3c855a2bbd8f8667d4cf2999e3f06bfa#n385>

================================================================================Redis 3.2.10 Released Fri Jul 28 17:49:07 CEST 2017================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: This release contains a number of fixes that are not critical in the general case, but quite important in certain use cases. Upgrading is suggested but not mandatory.
Dear Redis users,
while 4.0.1 is already out, this is a maintenance release of Redis 3.2.It fixes several bugs, the most interesting ones are the following:
1. INFO server.stat\_net\_output\_bytes field was computed in a wrong way, now the output is correct.2. SET with EX/PX options are now propagated correctly in the AOF, using the absolute times.3. CLIENT PAUSE was fixed to prevent eviction of keys, so that master and slave continue to be consistent for the time the pause is active.4. GEORADIUS(BYMEMBER)\_RO variants for read-only operations added.5. HyperLogLog sanity detection fixed in an edge case.6. Redis Cluster crash due to mis-handling of hidden node flags fixed.
If you think you may be affected by the above problems, upgrading is agood idea.
Have a nice day,Salvatore

================================================================================Redis 3.2.8 Released Sun Feb 12 16:11:18 CET 2017================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release reverts back the Jemalloc upgrade that is believed to potentially cause a server deadlock. A MIGRATE crash is also fixed.
Two important bug fixes, the first of one is critical:
1. Apparently Jemalloc 4.4.0 may contain a deadlock under particular conditions. See https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3799. We reverted back to the previously used Jemalloc versions and plan to upgrade Jemalloc again after having more info about the cause of the bug.
2. MIGRATE could crash the server after a socket error. See for reference: https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3796.

================================================================================Redis 3.2.7 Released Tue Jan 31 16:21:41 CET 2017================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: This release fixes important security and correctness issues. It is especially important to upgrade for Redis Cluster users and for users running Redis in their laptop since a cross-scripting attack is fixed in this release.
Main bugs fixes and improvements in this release:
1. MIGRATE could incorrectly move keys between Redis Cluster nodes by turning keys with an expire set into persisting keys. This bug was introduced with the multiple-keys migration recently. It is now fixed. Only applies to Redis Cluster users that use the resharding features of Redis Cluster.
2. As Redis 4.0 beta and the unstable branch already did (for some months at this point), Redis 3.2.7 also aliases the Host: and POST commands to QUIT avoiding to process the remaining pipeline if there are pending commands. This is a security protection against a "Cross Scripting" attack, that usually involves trying to feed Redis with HTTP in order to execute commands. Example: a developer is running a local copy of Redis for development purposes. She also runs a web browser in the same computer. The web browser could send an HTTP request to http://127.0.0.1:6379 in order to access the Redis instance, since a specially crafted HTTP requesta may also be partially valid Redis protocol. However if POST and Host: break the connection, this problem should be avoided. IMPORTANT: It is important to realize that it is not impossible that another way will be found to talk with a localhost Redis using a Cross Protocol attack not involving sending POST or Host: so this is only a layer of protection but not a definitive fix for this class of issues.
3. A ziplist bug that could cause data corruption, could crash the server and MAY ALSO HAVE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS was fixed. The bug looks complex to exploit, but attacks always get worse, never better (cit). The bug is very very hard to catch in practice, it required manual analysis of the ziplist code in order to be found. However it is also possible that rarely it happened in the wild. Upgrading is required if you use LINSERT and other in-the-middle list manipulation commands.
4. We upgraded to Jemalloc 4.4.0 since the version we used to ship with Redis was an early 4.0 release of Jemalloc. This version may have several improvements including the ability to better reclaim/use the memory of system.

================================================================================Redis 3.2.6 Released Tue Dec 06 09:33:29 CET 2016================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: GEORADIUS, BITFIELD and Redis Cluster minor fixes.
This release mainly fixes three bugs:
1. A bug with BITFIELD that may cause the bitmap corruption when setting offsets larger than the current string size.
2. A GEORADIUS bug that may happen when using very large radius lengths, in the range of 10000km or alike, due to wrong bounding box calculation.
3. A bug with Redis Cluster which crashes when reading a nodes configuration file with zero bytes at the end, which sometimes happens with certain ext4 configurations after a system crash.

================================================================================Redis 3.2.4 Released Mon Sep 26 08:58:21 CEST 2016================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Redis 3.2 and unstable contained a security vulnerability fixed by this release.
Hello Redis Wizards of the Memory Stores Empire,
this is a Redis critical release in order to fix a security issuewhich is documented clearly here:
 https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/6d9f8e2462fc2c426d48c941edeb78e5df7d2977
Thanks to Cory Duplantis of Cisco Talos for reporting the issue.
IMPACT:
The gist is that using CONFIG SET calls (or by manipulating redis.conf)an attacker is able to compromise certain fields of the "server" globalstructure, including the aof filename pointer, that could be made pointingto something else. In turn the AOF name is used in different contexts suchas logging, rename(2) and open(2) syscalls, leading to potential problems.
Please note that since having access to CONFIG SET also means to be ableto change the AOF filename (and many other things) directly, this issueactual real world impact is quite small, so I would not panik: if youhave CONFIG SET level of access, you can do more and more easily.
AFFECTED VERSIONS:
All Redis 3.2.x versions are affected.
OTHER CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE:
This release also includes other things:
\* TCP binding bug fixed when only certain addresses were available fora given port.
\* A much better crash report that includes part of the Redis binary:this will allow to fix bugs even when we just have a crash log andno other help from the original poster oft the issue.
\* A fix for Redis Cluster redis-trib displaying of info after creatinga new cluster.
Please check the following list of commits for credits about who did what.Thanks to all the contributors and a special thank to Oran Agra for thehelp in this release.

================================================================================Redis 3.2.3 Released Tue Aug 02 10:55:24 CEST 2016================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: Fix replication delay and redis-cli security issue.
Hello,
this is a minor release of Redis addressing two bugs:
1. There was an inverted if statement logic problem in replication.c causing a replication delay. This is not an actual problem since things work as expected, but worth to fix ASAP anyway.
2. Redis-cli created the history file with insecure permissions, allowing reding from the file. This was actually a bug in linenoise which is now fixed. The applied fix is from Chris Lamb.

================================================================================Redis 3.2.2 Released Thu Jul 28 14:14:54 CEST 2016================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: A Redis server and a Sentinel crash are now fixed. GEORADIUS errors in reported entries are fixed.
Hi all! Redis 3.2.2 is finally out with non trivial bugfixes and a few newfeatures. Let's start from the bugs:
1. There was a bug in the List type implementation, able to cause the crash of the server under certain (non trivial to replicate) circumstances when the LSET command was used. Now the bug is fixed and a new stress tester that was able to easily trigger the bug was added to the test suite.
2. Redis Sentinel, when monitoring multiple masters, could crash after a Sentinel address update event.
3. Redis Sentinel now checks slaves INFO state more often when disconnected. This is not really a bug fix, but may allow to more easily detect that a slave is able to fail over its master reducing certain delays.
4. It was possible, under a variety of conditions, that the AOF and RDB children process could spawn at the same time. This is known to trash disk I/O, AOF performances, and to ultimately create latency in the Redis server. Normally Redis avoids to have the two writing children at the same time, but there were edge cases discovered by Oran Agra (that also co-authored the fix with me) where the double-fork could happen. In order to fix this bug non trivial changes to the replication code were operated, however it was important to back port this fix into 3.2.2 because the bug could lead to bad latency experiences in certain cases.
5. Many GEORADIUS bugs are now fixed \o/. This started as a failing CI test. I grepped for more clues and there were a number of random failures in the points reported by GEORADIUS. The errors were found to be related to three different bugs (one of these was a bug in the test itself). It's not a critical bug: the effect is to, sometimes, don't report objects that are near the radius, but only with specific sets of coordinates and radius settings. However now the issues are fixed and the error vectors were added as regression tests.
And now the good news (not that bug fixes are not good...), that is, thenew features!
1. Now slaves support the slave-announce-ip and slave-announce-port options. Using these features a slave can be reported by the master `INFO` output and `ROLE` command as having arbitrary IP and port. This allows to have Sentinel deployments when working with containers or NAT-ed environments more easily.
2. The RDB check utlity is now part of Redis and uses the same RDB code that Redis uses in order to load the dataset in memory, so a given version of Redis is always able to check the RDB it produced... without another external check tool which is supposed to be taken in sync with the rdb.c implementation. This in turn also means that the new RDB checking is able to spot more complex bugs, since it really loads the dataset instead of just skipping bytes.
About the redis-check-dump utility, now it is also able to show certaininformation about the RDB file, like the version that produced it, whenit was produced, and so forth. Example:
 ./redis-check-rdb dump.rdb [offset 0] Checking RDB file dump.rdb [offset 32] AUX FIELD redis-ver = '3.2.2' [offset 46] AUX FIELD redis-bits = '64' [offset 58] AUX FIELD ctime = '1469710178' [offset 73] AUX FIELD used-mem = '1186528'
The ability to check how much memory was used by the instance that producedthe RDB file can be especially useful.
For credits and the full change log, see the list of commits below, that wasmodified in order to be a bit less verbose compared to the last releases.
Enjoy!Salvatore

================================================================================Redis 3.2.1 Released Fri Jun 17 15:01:56 CEST 2016================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Critical fix to Redis Sentinel, due to 3.2.0 regression compared to 3.0.
Hey, this is Redis 3.2.1, and this release should bring some grain ofmaturity to Redis 3.2. The list of commits following this note will tellyou the details, but the main things addressed in this release are thefollowing:
1. A critical bug in Sentinel was hopefully fixed. During the big 3.2 refactoring of Redis Sentinel, in order to implement connection sharing to make Sentinel able to scale better (few Sentinels to monitor many masters), a bug was introduced that mis-counted the number of pending commands in the Redis link. This in turn resulted into an inability to talk with certain Redis instances. A common result of this bug was the inability of Redis Sentinel to reconfigure back the old master, after a failover, when it is reachable again, as the slave of the new master. This was due to the inability to talk with the old master at all.
2. BITFIELD bugs fixed.
3. GEO commands fixes on syntax errors and edge cases.
4. RESTORE now accepts dumps generated by older Redis versions.
5. Jemalloc now is really configured to save you memory, for a problem a change in the jemalloc configuration did not really survived when the 3.2.0 release was finalized.
6. TTL and TYPE command no longer alter the last access time of a key, for LRU evictions purposes. A new TOUCH command was introduced \*just\* to update the access time of a key.
7. A bug was fixed in redis-cli, that connected to the instance running on the port 6379 if there was one, regardless of what was specified.
8. TCP keep alive is now enabled by default. This should fix most ghost connections problems without resulting in any practical change in otherwise sane deployments.
9. A Sentinel crash that could happen during failovers was fixed.
And of course, more minor things that you can read in the detailed logbelow. There are still reported bugs for 3.2 that were not fixed in thisrelease, but nothing critical AFAIK, and I wanted to release this one ASAP,so likely a new release will not be too far.
Enjoy,Salvatore

This bug most experienced effect was an inability of Redis toreconfigure back old masters to slaves after they are reachable againafter a failover. This was due to failing to reset the count of thepending commands properly, so the master appeared fovever down.
Was introduced in Redis 3.2 new Sentinel connection sharing featurewhich is a lot more complex than the 3.0 code, but more scalable.
Many thanks to people reporting the issue, and especially to@sskorgal for investigating the issue in depth.
Hopefully closes #3285.

I recently introduced populating the autocomplete help array with theCOMMAND command if available. However this was performed before parsingthe arguments, defaulting to instance 6379. After the connection isperformed it remains stable.
The effect is that if there is an instance running on port 6339,whatever port you specify is ignored and 6379 is connected to instead.The right port will be selected only after a reconnection.
Close #3314.

Reference issue #3218.
Checking the code I can't find a reason why the original RESTOREcode was so opinionated about restoring only the current version. Thecode in to `rdb.c` appears to be capable as always to restore data fromolder versions of Redis, and the only places where it is needed thecurrent version in order to correctly restore data, is while loading theopcodes, not the values itself as it happens in the case of RESTORE.
For the above reasons, this commit enables RESTORE to accept olderversions of values payloads.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them ‚Äî but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

### @georgenicolaou **[georgenicolaou](/georgenicolaou)** commented [Nov 30, 2013](#issue-23527588)

the redis-cli history file (in linenoise) is created with the default OS umask value which makes it world readable in most systems and could potentially expose authentication credentials to other users.

PS: I think AUTH commands shouldn't be logged in the history file at all

Sorry, something went wrong.

Package        : redis
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-7458
Debian Bug     : 832460

It was discovered that redis, a persistent key-value database, did not
properly protect redis-cli history files: they were created by default
with world-readable permissions.

Users and systems administrators may want to proactively change
permissions on existing ~/rediscli_history files, instead of waiting
for the updated redis-cli to do so the next time it is run.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u5.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 2:3.2.1-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| It is not my call but this is ok imo.  I suggest a new "docstring", this is explicit and clear to POSIX users:  You can also +use `linenoiseHistoryPrivSave` to no group nor world access when creating +a new history file on POSIX systems.  On POSIX systems, you can optionally use linenoiseHistoryPrivSave() to force saving the command line history file with a umask of 0077 ("u=rwx, g=, o=") This will block world and group from accessing a critical history file without changing your shell's default umask. |
