Package        : nbd
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-7441 CVE-2015-0847
Debian Bug     : 781547 784657

Tuomas RÃƒÂ¤sÃƒÂ¤nen discovered that unsafe signal handling in nbd-server, the
server for the Network Block Device protocol, could allow remote
attackers to cause a deadlock in the server process and thus a denial of
service.

Tuomas RÃƒÂ¤sÃƒÂ¤nen also discovered that the modern-style negotiation was
carried out in the main server process before forking the actual client
handler. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service
(crash) by querying a non-existent export. This issue only affected the
oldstable distribution (wheezy).

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:3.2-4~deb7u5.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.8-4+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:3.10-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.

# USN-2676-1: NBD vulnerabilities

22 July 2015

Several security issues were fixed in NBD.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [nbd](/security/cves?package=nbd) - Network Block Device protocol

## Details

It was discovered that NBD incorrectly handled IP address matching. A

remote attacker could use this issue with an IP address that has a partial

match and bypass access restrictions. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-6410](/security/CVE-2013-6410))

Tuomas RÃ¤sÃ¤nen discovered that NBD incorrectly handled wrong export names

and closed connections during negotiation. A remote attacker could use this

issue to cause NBD to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-7441](/security/CVE-2013-7441))

Tuomas RÃ¤sÃ¤nen discovered that NBD incorrectly handled signals. A remote

attacker could use this issue to cause NBD to crash, resulting in a denial

of service. ([CVE-2015-0847](/security/CVE-2015-0847))

As far as we can tell, the CVE request is primarily about the
vulnerability that affects versions 2.9.22 through 3.3. Use
CVE-2013-7441.

>> Versions released between 2.9.16 and 2.9.22 ... are vulnerable in the
>> sense that the bad design is still there, but I don't believe they
>> would crash in that manner.

If someone is interested in a CVE ID for those older versions
(released in 2010 and 2011), and the behavior is different (e.g., if
the unexpected client behavior doesn't immediately lead to a crash and
instead can cause memory corruption), please let us know.

Subject: CVE Request: nbd denial of service

Hello,

the following vulnerability was reported in the Debian bug tracker for nbd:

> There's a remotely exploitable denial of service flaw, similar/identical
> to CVE-2011-1925 in nbd-server. It has been documented publicly in
> 2013-01-28[1]. It has been fixed in upstream version 3.4 [2] and hence
> affects only the stable release (1:3.2-4~deb7u4).

> [2]: <https://github.com/yoe/nbd/commit/741495cb08503fd32a9d22648e63b64390c601f4>
>
> The flaw can be exploited easily by connecting to a server (listening at
> 10.0.0.1 in this example) and asking for a non-existing export:

>   nbd-client 10.0.0.1 -N some-non-existing-export-name /dev/nbd1
>
> The root (listener) nbd-server process will exit because of failed
> negotiation procedure, effectively denying the service from others.

See <https://bugs.debian.org/781547>

According to the upstream author (Wouter Verhelst):

> versions <= 2.9.16 and >= 3.4 are definitely not vulnerable. Versions released
> immediately after CVE-2011-1925 are *probably* not vulnerable, but I'm not
> sure (and I don't want to go test all of them...). Versions released between
> 2.9.16 and 2.9.22 (which fixes CVE-2011-1925) are vulnerable in the sense that
> the bad design is still there, but I don't believe they would crash in that
> manner.

Can a CVE be assigned for this please?

Cheers

Subject: nbd-server: server dies if client asks for a non-existing export
Date: Mon, 30 Mar 2015 23:04:51 +0300
```
Package: nbd-server
Version: 1:3.2-4~deb7u4
Severity: important
Tags: security

Dear Maintainer,

There's a remotely exploitable denial of service flaw, similar/identical
to [CVE-2011-1925](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1925) in nbd-server. It has been documented publicly in
2013-01-28[1]. It has been fixed in upstream version 3.4 [2] and hence
affects only the stable release (1:3.2-4~deb7u4).

[1]: <http://sourceforge.net/p/nbd/mailman/message/30410146/>
[2]: <https://github.com/yoe/nbd/commit/741495cb08503fd32a9d22648e63b64390c601f4>

The flaw can be exploited easily by connecting to a server (listening at
10.0.0.1 in this example) and asking for a non-existing export:

  nbd-client 10.0.0.1 -N some-non-existing-export-name /dev/nbd1

The root (listener) nbd-server process will exit because of failed
negotiation procedure, effectively denying the service from others.

I'm the author of the commit which fixed the issue in upstream release
3.4 and I'm willing to help to get it fixed/backported also to stable. I
have drafted and tested a backported patch on top of nbd 1:3.2-4~deb7u4
[3]. It is basically identical to
741495cb08503fd32a9d22648e63b64390c601f4, I just had to use msg2(),
msg3() and msg4() instead of msg() and a single modernsock instead of a
socket array.

nbd-server: handle modern-style negotiation in a child process

[Browse files](/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/tree/741495cb08503fd32a9d22648e63b64390c601f4)

```
Previously, the modern style negotiation was carried out in the root
server (listener) process before forking the actual client handler. This
made it possible for a malfunctioning or evil client to terminate the
root process simply by querying a non-existent export or aborting in the
middle of the negotation process (caused SIGPIPE in the server).

This commit moves the negotiation process to the child to keep the root
process up and running no matter what happens during the negotiation.
