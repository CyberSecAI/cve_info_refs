Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-7020:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content from openwall.com clearly identifies CVE-2013-7020 as being associated with the following commit:
     `https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/b05cd1ea7e45a836f7f6071a716c38bb30326e0f`
   - The commit message on github.com further confirms this by stating: "ffv1dec: Check bits_per_raw_sample and colorspace for equality in ver 0/1 headers prevents inconsistency and out of array write".

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of `bits_per_raw_sample` and `colorspace` values within the FFV1 decoder when processing version 0 or 1 headers. Specifically, the decoder did not check for equality in these parameters, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Out-of-bounds write:** A critical vulnerability where the decoder writes data to a memory location beyond the allocated buffer, corrupting other memory regions or causing a crash.
   - **Data Inconsistency:** The lack of checks on `bits_per_raw_sample` and `colorspace` allows for inconsistencies in the decoder's internal state.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can overwrite other data structures in memory, leading to unpredictable behavior.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The memory corruption can cause the application to crash, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Maliciously crafted FFV1 video file:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing the FFmpeg library with a specially crafted FFV1 video file. This file would contain manipulated version 0 or 1 headers with inconsistent `bits_per_raw_sample` and `colorspace` values that trigger the flaw during decoding.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Ability to provide crafted media file:** An attacker must be able to supply a victim with a malicious FFV1 video file. This could occur through various channels such as:
        *   Embedding the video on a website
        *   Sending the video via email/messaging
        *   Providing the video as an input to a vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that `bits_per_raw_sample` and `colorspace` are equal in version 0/1 headers, thus preventing the inconsistency and out-of-bounds write.
- The `Found-by` information (e.g., "ami_stuff") suggests this vulnerability was discovered through internal or external vulnerability research.
- The vulnerability was found in the `ffv1dec.c` file which is part of libavcodec library.
