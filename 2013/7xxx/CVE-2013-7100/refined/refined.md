Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-7100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `unpacksms16()` function in `app_sms.c` of Asterisk.
*   This function is responsible for decoding 16-bit SMS messages.
*   The function incorrectly assumes that the user data header in the SMS message will always contain an even number of bytes.
*   When a multipart 16-bit SMS message with an odd number of bytes in the user data header is received, the decoding loop in `unpacksms16()` enters an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The infinite loop within `unpacksms16()` causes it to continuously write past the boundaries of the buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Infinite Loop:** The loop condition `l` (which is meant to control the loop based on the length of the message) never reaches 0 when the length of the data is odd, causing the infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The buffer overflow corrupts memory and results in a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), causing Asterisk to crash.
*   **Denial of Service:** The crash leads to a denial of service for the Asterisk server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote SMS Messages:** The vulnerability is triggered by receiving a specially crafted 16-bit multipart SMS message.
*   **Odd Length User Data Header:** The key is that the user data header within the SMS contains an odd number of bytes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send SMS messages to an Asterisk server that processes them via `app_sms`.
*   The attacker needs to craft an SMS message with a 16-bit encoding and an odd number of bytes in the user data header.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was found while receiving SMS messages from Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone to a German landline number handled by Asterisk.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by a patch that checks for an odd number of bytes in the user data header and adds an extra byte to ensure an even length, thereby preventing the infinite loop and buffer overflow.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Asterisk including open source and certified builds.
*   The fix is included in versions 1.8.24.1, 10.12.4, and 11.6.1 for open-source Asterisk, and corresponding certified and Digiumphone versions.
