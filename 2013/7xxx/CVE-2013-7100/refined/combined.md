| Summary: | ASTERISK-22590: BufferOverflow in unpacksms16() when receiving 16 bit multipart SMS with app\_sms | | |

| Priority: | Critical | Regression? |  |

| Environment: | Debian 7,1, Kernel 3.2.0-4-686-pae | Attachments: | ( 0) [Handle16BitSmsWithOddLength.patch](../attachments/22/ASTERISK-22590/00-Handle16BitSmsWithOddLength.patch)( 1) [smsT8](../attachments/22/ASTERISK-22590/01-smsT8) |
| Description: | In the current HEAD, a buffer overflow in app\_sms.c prevents Asterisk from receiving 16 bit multipart SMS, as it runs in an endless loop over the array boundaries.   The function unpacksms16() always expects an even number of bytes to be processed. If, however, the user data header contains an odd number of bytes, the second while-loop never terminates (l is never 0 in the while condition) and it keeps overwriting the boundaries of \*i until Asterisk terminates with a SIGSEGFAULT.  The odd number of bytes are according to specification, though (http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi\_ts%5C123000\_123099%5C123040%5C11.05.00\_60%5Cts\_123040v110500p.pdf page 74).   The error has been reproduced by sending a multipart SMS with 16 bit encoding from Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone to a German landline number, which is handled by Asterisk.   We have addressed this issue by creating a patch, which checks for an odd number of bytes and adds another byte in that case. | | |
| Comments: | By: Jan Juergens (j\_juergens) 2013-09-26 07:17:21.374-0500The patch that addresses the issue.  ---   By: Matt Jordan (mjordan) 2013-09-26 07:28:36.604-0500For now, I've locked down this issue to Bug Marshal + Issue Reporter.   In the future, if you think you've identified something that could be remotely exploitable, please contact a bug marshal or e-mail us at security@asterisk.org. That helps to keep such things from becoming public before they are addressed.  ---   By: Jan Juergens (j\_juergens) 2013-10-09 09:47:29.024-0500We dumped the content of a sms\_t struct at the beginning of sms\_handleincoming() while trying to understand the issue. I'll add it here so others can reproduce the bug. This data was received from the Deutsche Telekom.  ---   By: Scott Griepentrog (sgriepentrog) 2013-10-21 13:59:23.863-0500Jan-   Can you confirm that in your example smsT8 the text portion of the message is supposed to include the 4 character, as in "...adgj54" is correct instead of "...adgj5"?   Thanks,  Scott  ---   By: Jan Juergens (j\_juergens) 2013-10-23 09:04:13.052-0500Hi Scott, unfortunately, the phone from which we sent the test messages did not save all the sent messages. I found a message with a similar text passage, so I'm guessing this should be it:   Ucs2 mit uberlÂªnge  1.adgjmptw2.adgjmptw3.adgjmptw4.adgjmptw5.adgj543210.adgjmptw1Âªend   So yes, it looks like the 4 is included.  ---   By: Scott Griepentrog (sgriepentrog) 2013-10-23 09:49:30.767-0500Great!  Okay, then this patch duplicates that functionality and should be correct.  I'm running it on a test loop trying to break it against random garbage input and it's been fine so far, so there should be no more surprises.  --- | | |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2013-006

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Buffer Overflow when receiving odd length 16 bit SMS message |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Buffer Overflow and Remote Crash |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote SMS Messages |
| **Severity** | Major |
| **Exploits Known** | None |
| **Reported On** | September 26, 2013 |
| **Reported By** | Jan Juergens |
| **Posted On** | December 16, 2013 |
| **Last Updated On** | December 17, 2013 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Scott Griepentrog <sgriepentrog AT digium DOT com> |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2013-7100 |

| **Description** | A 16 bit SMS message that contains an odd message length value will cause the message decoding loop to run forever. The message buffer is not on the stack but will be overflowed resulting in corrupted memory and an immediate crash. |

| **Resolution** | This patch corrects the evaluation of the message length indicator, ensuring that the message decoding loop will stop at the end of the received message.    Thanks to Jan Juergens for finding, reporting, testing, and providing a fix for this problem. |

| **Affected Versions** | | |
| **Product** | **Release Series** |  |
| Asterisk Open Source | 1.8.x | All Versions |
| Asterisk Open Source | 10.x | All Versions |

Package        : asterisk
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-7100
Debian Bug     : 732355

Jan Juergens discovered a buffer overflow in the parser for SMS messages
in Asterisk.

An additional change was backported, which is fully described in
<http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2013-007.html>

With the fix for AST-2013-007, a new configuration option was added in
order to allow the system adminitrator to disable the expansion of
"dangerous" functions (such as SHELL()) from any interface which is not
the dialplan. In stable and oldstable this option is disabled by default.
To enable it add the following line to the section '[options]' in
/etc/asterisk/asterisk.conf (and restart asterisk)

  live_dangerously = no

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze12.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8.13.1~dfsg1-3+deb7u3.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:11.7.0~dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:11.7.0~dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.
