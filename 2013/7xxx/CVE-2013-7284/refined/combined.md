# PlRPC Perl module: pre-auth remote code execution, weak crypto

---

*From*: Florian Weimer <fweimer () redhat com>

PlRPC is a Perl module that implements IDL-free RPCs. It is intended
for cross-domain applications, but it fails to achieve that goal because
it uses Storable, which is known to be insecure when deserializing
(thawing) untrusted data. User name and password are transmitted using
Storable, so code execution can happen before authentication.
```

```
The cryptographic hook built into PlRPC is limited: there is no MAC, no
reply protection, and there's just a symmetric group key shared by all
users. It's not really PlRPC's fault, considering its age.
```

<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=90474>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1030572>

```
PlRPC mainly lives on because it is a dependency of DBD::Proxy, which is
carried around by the DBI module.
```

```
This might warrant two CVE assignments (one for the Storable-based code
execution), and one for the weak crypto. This was first reported in
2013. The patches that exist just document the issues and are not real
fixes (for Storable itself, there is only a documentation fix, so this
has precedent).

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572#c0)  Florian Weimer    2013-11-14 17:23:00 UTC  ``` The transport layer uses messages encoded with Storable.  Storable is not secure across trust boundaries, see the warning that upstream added in Version 2.45.  We should at least add a strong warning that PlRPC is equally unsafe.  In addition, the instructions are overly optimistic.  We don't seem to ship any really strong ciphers, and the API of the Crypt:: modules is not really a good match for authenticated encryption modes.  (Unauthenticated tend to be vulnerable to all kinds of attacks.)  There appears to be zero reply protection.  Additionally, compression is enabled unconditionally, which can reveal message contents, especially in conjunction with chosen-ciphertext attacks.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572#c4)  Petr Pisar    2013-11-18 11:33:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 825551](attachment.cgi?id=825551&action=diff "Proposed documentation fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=825551&action=edit "Proposed documentation fix") Proposed documentation fix  This has been posted to the upstream for a review.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572#c5)  Florian Weimer    2013-11-18 11:38:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to Petr Pisar from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572#c4)) > Created [attachment 825551](attachment.cgi?id=825551&action=diff "Proposed documentation fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=825551&action=edit "Proposed documentation fix") > Proposed documentation fix >  > This has been posted to the upstream for a review.  It seems that Storable deserialization is exposed prior to password-based authentication (see how AcceptUser is called in the server code).  I think the warning should mention that.  It's probably best to replace the entire "SECURITY" section with a clear warning that you absolutely have to use an external authentication mechanism.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572#c6)  Petr Pisar    2013-11-18 12:43:24 UTC  ``` You are right. However the decryption is done before deserialization. So I guess if somebody wants to use a password for authentication, he will use encryption too. And that turns into two-step authentication as drafted in the SECURITY/Protection against untrusted users/Encryption paragraph:  I recommend two phase encryption: The first phase is the login phase, where to use a host based key. As soon as the user has authorized, you should switch to a user based key. See the DBI::ProxyServer for an example.  I will improve the text.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572#c7)  Petr Pisar    2013-11-18 12:57:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 825588](attachment.cgi?id=825588&action=diff "Proposed documentation fix 2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=825588&action=edit "Proposed documentation fix 2") Proposed documentation fix 2  Updated documentation.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572#c8)  Petr Pisar    2013-11-18 12:59:39 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 825589](attachment.cgi?id=825589&action=diff "Proposed documentation fix 2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=825589&action=edit "Proposed documentation fix 2") Proposed documentation fix 2  Correct README conversion.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572#c9)  Petr Pisar    2013-11-26 13:01:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 829254](attachment.cgi?id=829254&action=diff "Proposed documentation fix 2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=829254&action=edit "Proposed documentation fix 2") Proposed documentation fix 2  I attached wrong patch.

Subject: [CVE-2013-7284] Remote pre-authentication code execution in PlRPC
Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2014 21:01:53 +0100
```
Package: libplrpc-perl
Severity: grave
Version: 0.2020-2
Tags: security upstream

The PlRPC module uses Storable in an unsafe way, leading to a remote
code execution vulnerability (in both the client and the server).

Upstream bug report:

<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=90474>

A fix (which is not yet available) requires a protocol change.  I
think we should remove the package from the distribution instead.

```

Use CVE-2013-7284 for this code-execution issue.

```

```

At this point, we will postpone deciding on the number of CVE IDs
needed for cryptographic issues in PlRPC, pending a possible upstream
response that might clarify whether the product had been specifically
trying to achieve the associated cryptographic goals.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-09 17:28:57 UTC  ``` PlRPC is a Perl module that implements IDL-free RPCs. It is intended for cross-domain applications, but it fails to achieve that goal because it uses Storable, which is known to be insecure when deserializing (thawing) untrusted data. User name and password are transmitted using Storable, so code execution can happen before authentication.  The patches that exist just document the issues and are not real fixes.  References: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/56> <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=90474>  Commit/Patch: <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/perl-PlRPC.git/commit/?id=b9497b8d780a54ff5be6661c5f24d70135e0bb79>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c1)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-09 17:32:38 UTC  ```  Created perl-PlRPC tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1051110](show_bug.cgi?id=1051110 "CLOSED WONTFIX - perl-PlRPC: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-01-09 22:01:40 UTC  ``` The actual proposed patch to upstream is here:  * <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Ticket/Attachment/1293961/685696/0001-Security-notice-on-Storable-and-reply-attack.patch>  Based on the discussion in [bug #1030572](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - perl-PlRPC: not secure across trust boundaries"), there is no real "fix" for this as it seems that Storable deserialization is exposed prior to password-based authentication (see how AcceptUser is called in the server code).  MITRE assigned [CVE-2013-7284](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7284) to this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c3)  Petr Pisar    2014-01-10 08:54:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c2)) > The actual proposed patch to upstream is here: >  > * > <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Ticket/Attachment/1293961/685696/0001-Security>- > notice-on-Storable-and-reply-attack.patch >  > Based on the discussion in [bug #1030572](show_bug.cgi?id=1030572 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - perl-PlRPC: not secure across trust boundaries"), there is no real "fix" for this as > it seems that Storable deserialization is exposed prior to password-based > authentication (see how AcceptUser is called in the server code). >  > MITRE assigned [CVE-2013-7284](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7284) to this issue.  Is amending the PlRPC documentation with this patch sufficient to close this bug, or should we keep this open until a real fix in the code (extension of Storable module and utilizing it in PlRPC) will be available?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 10:41:54 UTC  ``` Here is Storable documentation that describes security risks of deserializing untrusted inputs using Storable: <http://search.cpan.org/~ams/Storable-2.45/Storable.pm#SECURITY_WARNING>  The only package shipped in Red Hat Software Collections 1 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Beta is perl-DBI with DBI::Proxy / DBI::ProxyServer modules.  Those modules are not used by any other package shipped as part of those products.  There is an upstream bug requesting addition of security warnings to DBI documentation: <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=90475>  It does not seem there's a way to fix without introducing incompatible protocol change by using different way to serialize data for network transfer.  Alternative may be to have Storable provide a safe mode to deserialize untrusted inputs.  That seems to be on the Storable upstream TODO list, but not available in current version.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 10:43:19 UTC  ``` Possible mitigation here is to use host based access restrictions to any service using PlRPC to ensure only trusted hosts/users have access.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 10:55:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c5)) > The only package shipped in Red Hat Software Collections 1 and Red Hat > Enterprise Linux 7 Beta is perl-DBI with DBI::Proxy / DBI::ProxyServer > modules.  Those modules are not used by any other package shipped as part of > those products.  Search through Debian archive (using <http://codesearch.debian.net/>) also fails to find any user of PlRPC or DBI::Proxy*.  Reducing impact rating based on the fact that this module does not seem to be used by any real world application.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c9)  Petr Pisar    2014-05-30 11:20:32 UTC  ``` Without PlRPC modules, DBD::Proxy* modules have to be removed. Without DBD::Proxy* modules, Bundle::DBI module, DBI's t/80proxy.t test and DBI's /usr/bin/dbiproxy tool have to be removed.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1051108#c10)  Stefan Cornelius    2014-06-10 09:35:22 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
