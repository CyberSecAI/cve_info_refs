Based on the provided content, here's the extracted information regarding CVE-2013-7284:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The PlRPC Perl module uses the `Storable` module for serializing and deserializing data. `Storable` is known to be insecure when handling untrusted data due to its ability to execute arbitrary code during deserialization. User credentials are also transmitted using `Storable`, meaning an attacker can execute code before authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The core issue is the use of `Storable` to deserialize untrusted data, which allows for pre-authentication remote code execution.
- **Weak cryptography:** While not the focus of CVE-2013-7284, the content mentions that PlRPC has weak cryptography (no MAC, no reply protection, and a shared symmetric key), making it vulnerable to other attacks, although it's not considered PlRPC's fault due to its age.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server by sending malicious serialized data to the PlRPC service. This occurs prior to authentication, meaning the attacker does not need valid credentials.
- **Information Disclosure:** Additionally, the unconditional compression could expose message contents through chosen-ciphertext attacks (though this is not the main focus of the CVE).

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if they can reach the PlRPC service.
- **Malicious serialized data:** The attacker sends specially crafted, malicious serialized data to the PlRPC service, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PlRPC service.
- **Ability to craft malicious input:** The attacker needs to be able to craft serialized data that can exploit the unsafe deserialization process of the `Storable` module.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability exists in both client and server implementations of PlRPC.
- There is no easy fix for this vulnerability without changing the protocol and moving away from `Storable`.
- Mitigation strategies include host-based access restrictions.
- The affected software is mainly used in `DBD::Proxy`, which is a dependency of the `DBI` module.
- Patches primarily consist of documentation updates and warnings about the dangers of using `Storable` in this manner, as a proper fix requires protocol changes.
