Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7013:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
The provided content includes a commit message that explicitly references "Fixes out of array accesses in g2m4" and a ticket number #2922, which matches information mentioned in the openwall email, the github commit message, and the trac ticket. Therefore, the content is related to CVE-2013-7013.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
The root cause is an incorrect order of operations when calculating memory allocation for image tiles in the g2m4 decoder. The code was performing alignment after multiplying by the pixel size, resulting in an allocation that was too small, and could lead to out of bounds writes when decompressing data. 

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to insufficient buffer allocation for tiles in the g2m4 decoder. Specifically, the `c->tile_stride` was calculated using: `FFALIGN(c->tile_width, 16) * 3;` instead of  `FFALIGN(c->tile_width * 3, 16)`. This incorrect stride calculation led to a smaller than needed buffer, resulting in out-of-array writes during the decoding process.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
   -  **Segmentation Fault (SIGSEGV):** As shown in the provided gdb output, a segmentation fault occurs due to memory corruption when `_int_malloc` tries to allocate memory at an address which is not accessible.
   -  **Memory Corruption:** Out of bounds write corrupts memory. The "corrupted double-linked list" message indicates such corruption.
   -  **Crash:** The provided logs indicate crashes when decoding crafted files.
   -  **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution (Unconfirmed):** The Gentoo Security Advisory mentions "arbitrary code execution" is a possible outcome, however the provided logs only show memory corruption leading to crashes.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   -  **File Input:** A malicious crafted media file using the G2M4 codec is supplied as input to a vulnerable FFmpeg instance.
   -  **Decoding:** The vulnerability is triggered during the decoding of G2M4 video data.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Crafted Media File:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted G2M4 video file that can trigger this specific bug in allocation calculation.
   - **FFmpeg Processing:** A vulnerable FFmpeg must process the crafted media file. 

**Additional Notes**
- The fix involves a simple correction in the `g2m_init_buffers` function in `libavcodec/g2meet.c` to compute the tile stride using the correct order of operations: `c->tile_stride = FFALIGN(c->tile_width * 3, 16);`.
- The vulnerability was found by "ami_stuff".
- The issue was present in the `git-master` version of FFmpeg.
- The fix was introduced in commit `821a5938d100458f4d09d634041b05c860554ce0`.
- The vulnerability is located in the `libavcodec/g2meet.c` file, specifically within the `g2m_init_buffers` function.
- The trac ticket #2922 is related to this vulnerability.
- The issue was fixed on September 15, 2013

This vulnerability is a critical issue in FFmpeg's G2M4 decoder, leading to potential denial of service and, more worryingly, the possibility of arbitrary code execution, requiring careful handling and patching of vulnerable systems.
