Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7299:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing null termination in the Tntnet web server's HTTP header parsing logic. When a crafted HTTP request ends its headers with a single newline character ("\n") instead of the expected carriage return and newline ("\r\n"), the parser fails to properly terminate the header string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Null Termination:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of null termination when parsing HTTP headers ending with "\n".
*   **Header Appending:** Due to the missing null termination, headers from a previous unrelated request can be appended to a crafted request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can potentially inject sensitive headers from other users' requests into their own, such as:
    *   Cookies (session hijacking)
    *   HTTP authentication credentials.
*   **Confidentiality breach:** The ability to access other user's headers can lead to exposure of sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a malicious HTTP request where the headers are terminated with a single newline character ("\n") instead of the standard "\r\n".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No authentication:** No specific authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
* The fix was implemented by commit 9bd3b14 which added a check to ensure header data does not exceed the buffer size and commit 9d1a859e which added additional validation for newlines in the header.
* The vulnerability affects Tntnet version <= 2.2 and is fixed in version 2.2.1
* The vulnerability allows for information disclosure through the leakage of sensitive header information.
