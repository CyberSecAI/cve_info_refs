Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-7249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `to_json` method for user models in Fat Free CRM was using default serialization, which exposed sensitive user data, including password hashes and salts, when a JSON request was made (e.g., `/users/1.json`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure:  The default `to_json` method was not sanitizing the output, leading to the exposure of sensitive data.
- Lack of Custom Serialization: The application didn't have a custom `to_json` method to control which user attributes are exposed when rendering JSON responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Information Access: An attacker, if logged in, could access other users' password hashes and salts.
- Potential for Credential Compromise: Although plain text passwords are not exposed, the leak of password hashes and salts could be used for offline attacks (e.g., cracking attempts) and further compromise user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access: An attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Authenticated User: The attacker must be logged into the application to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account and be logged into the Fat Free CRM application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application (e.g., by using a web browser or a command-line tool).

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was publicly disclosed on December 24, 2013, by joernchen.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by adding a custom `to_json` method to the user model that only exposes the user's name, preventing leakage of other sensitive information. Additionally, the to_xml method was also customized.
*   The fix also included restricting access to user data via JSON and XML by modifying the routes, excluding index and destroy actions.
*   The fix was committed on December 27, 2013,  and is associated with commit `cf26a04b356ad2161c4c6160260eb870a3de5328`.
