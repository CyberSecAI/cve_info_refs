The most reliable and versatile information security software on the market, reacts immediately to threats and the notification appears on the screen immediately.

– F‑Secure Total customer

It just seems to work well in the back­ground and F‑Secure have kept my computers safe for many years.

– F-Secure Internet Security Customer

Works and is reliable, just great!

– F-Secure VPN Customer

It's an easy and safe way to save passwords and protect other personal information.

– F-Secure ID Protection Customer

my computer came with f-secure and im very happy with it! comes with a vpn and lots of other stuff as well

– maria @svnflowerhrry

...so I urge everyone to use a password vault, a fairly cheap one on a cheap yearly price can be obtained from @FSecure. I use it daily on PC and mobile. Includes VPN and virus protection. The other method is to use 2-step authentication. Preferably both. Be safe. Bless you.

– Matti Hirvonen @Hiljaa\_Tulee

Remember to always protect your internet connections. An easy way to do this is to use a trusted and paid VPN service. I recommend @FSecure’s VPN, because it’s made by a cyber security company, whose only purpose is to safe­guard the data and privacy of its customers. #InfoSec

User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the FSDBCom ActiveX control. The issue lies in the failure to sanitize input before executing SQL queries. By carefully constructing a series of SQL queries an attacker can force the backend database to execute arbitrary code. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the backend database. |
