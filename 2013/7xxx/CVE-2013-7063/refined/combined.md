Hash: SHA1

SA-CONTRIB-2013-093   CVE-2013-7063

SA-CONTRIB-2013-094   CVE-2013-7064

Note that this says 'The module doesn't sufficiently fiter [sic] and
validate configuration values entered by administrators. This
vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have a
role with the permission "Administer EU Cookie Compliance popup".' Our
perspective is that, typically, web applications do not have a threat
model in which crafted configuration settings entered by admins are a
vector that qualifies for a CVE assignment. You, in the context of
representing the "vendor" of the module, are allowed to have that
threat model if you want to. (This is entirely reasonable if an XSS
attack would realistically result in privilege escalation to a
higher-level admin account.) If you want to reconsider, we can
optionally reject this CVE for you. Otherwise, it will remain a valid
(and non-disputed) CVE.

Subject: CVE request for Drupal core, and contributed modules

Hi there, here is a combined request for CVE identifiers for Drupal core,
and contributed modules.

First, core:
SA-CORE-2013-003 - Drupal core - Multiple vulnerabilities
 <https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003>

- "Multiple vulnerabilities due to optimistic cross-site request forgery
protection (Form API validation - Drupal 6 and 7)": Correct me if I'm
wrong, but I read this as a single vulnerability in the underlying core
CSRF prevention code; it manifests differently based on the user-created
("contrib") callbacks that employ it.

- "Multiple vulnerabilities due to weakness in pseudorandom number
generation using mt_rand() (Form API, OpenID and random password generation
- Drupal 6 and 7)": Not sure if further classification of this one is
necessary.

- "Code execution prevention" for the "files" directory .htaccess for
Apache: Execution of local code.

- Access bypass in security token validation (as performed by
drupal_valid_token() ).

- Cross-site scripting in Drupal core's Image module.

- Open redirect in Drupal core's Overlay module.

Now the contributed modules:
SA-CONTRIB-2013-093 - Invitation - Access Bypass
<https://drupal.org/node/2140097>

SA-CONTRIB-2013-094 - EU Cookie Compliance - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
<https://drupal.org/node/2140123>

SA-CONTRIB-2013-095 - Organic Groups - Access bypass
<https://drupal.org/node/2140217>

SA-CONTRIB-2013-096 - Entity reference - Access bypass
<https://drupal.org/node/2140237>

SA-CONTRIB-2013-097 - OG Features - Access bypass
<https://drupal.org/node/2149791>

Thanks!

Forest
