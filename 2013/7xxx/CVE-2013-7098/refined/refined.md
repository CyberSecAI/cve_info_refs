Based on the provided changelog, the following information regarding CVE-2013-7098 can be extracted:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A potential heap overflow could occur if the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is increased during a reconnection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap overflow vulnerability when MTU is increased on reconnection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A heap overflow can lead to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific scenario during reconnection with increased MTU.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to somehow force the MTU to increase on reconnection. This might be possible by manipulating the server's response during the negotiation.
