Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-7182

**Vulnerability Description:**
*   The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in Fortinet FortiOS 5.0.5 and potentially earlier versions.
*   The "mkey" parameter within the "/firewall/schedule/recurrdlg" page is vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack.

**Root Cause:**
*   The root cause is improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the "mkey" parameter does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before being included in the HTML output, which allows for injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. This allows an attacker to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of an end-user's browser session. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Stealing session cookies, potentially leading to account compromise.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing malicious script within the "mkey" parameter.
*   The attacker needs to entice or trick the user to visit the malicious URL.
*   Since it is a reflected XSS, the malicious script is not stored on the server but rather embedded within the URL and is executed by the victim's browser when the crafted URL is accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the FortiOS system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
*   The attacker must induce a victim to access the manipulated URL (e.g., via social engineering, phishing).

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by William Costa.
*   The vendor released FortiOS 5.0.6 to address this vulnerability.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   **Base Score:** 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
*   **Temporal Score:** 3.3 (E:U/RL:ND/RC:UC)
