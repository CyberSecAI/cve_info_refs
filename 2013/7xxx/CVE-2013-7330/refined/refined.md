Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7330:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks in the standard post-build action within Jenkins. Specifically, when configuring a job to trigger a downstream project, the system didn't verify if the user had the necessary permission (`BUILD`) to actually build the downstream project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks. A user could configure a build trigger to initiate a downstream build even without the right permissions to do so directly.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Job Execution:** A malicious user could configure a job (Job X) to trigger another job (Job Y) that they do not have permission to build directly, thus circumventing intended access controls.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Configuration Modification:** The attack is performed through the job configuration interface. A user with permission to configure a job can add or modify the post-build action to trigger a build of another job without having the necessary build permissions for that downstream job.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Jenkins User Account:** An attacker must have a valid Jenkins user account.
- **Job Configuration Permission:** The attacker needs to have the permission to configure at least one Jenkins job.

**Additional details:**
* The fix implemented in commit `36342d71e29e0620f803a7470ce96c61761648d8` addresses this vulnerability by introducing permission checks to verify the user has `BUILD` permission on the downstream project before allowing configuration.
* The commit also includes changes to provide error messages in the UI when the user lacks required permissions.
* This vulnerability is related to SECURITY-55 in Jenkins.
* The vulnerability is rated as high severity, because it allowed privilege escalation using valid user accounts.
