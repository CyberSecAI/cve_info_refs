Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7273:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the GNOME Display Manager (gdm) when the "disable-user-list" setting is enabled (set to true). This setting disables the display of a user list and instead presents username and password fields directly.
- When a user enters a username and is then prompted for a password, pressing the "cancel" button triggers a sequence of events that lead to a broken state in the greeter. The greeter's UI elements disappear and the user is unable to interact further with the login screen.
- The root cause is related to a race condition where D-Bus signals and the reset functions are not processed correctly, resulting in a disabled state for the greeter's extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary vulnerability is a DoS condition that prevents users from logging into the system.
- **Incorrect State Handling:** GDM fails to properly reset its state after a user cancels the login process when `disable_user_list` is set to true. This leads to a state where no interactive elements are available, rendering the system inaccessible.
- **Timing Issue:**  A timing-dependent case or race condition is involved in the issue, making it difficult to reproduce consistently under debugging.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Denial of Service:** A local user can trigger the vulnerability, preventing any user from logging into the system.
- **System Unusability:** The system becomes unusable, requiring an administrator to kill the X server, restart the display manager, or reboot the machine to restore the login screen.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system. The attacker needs to have access to the login screen.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker interacts with the login screen by entering a username and then pressing the "cancel" button or the escape key at the password prompt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** Any user with local access to the system's login screen can trigger this vulnerability. No special privileges are required.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to interact with the login screen, specifically how to use the cancel button.
- **GDM Configuration:** The target system must be configured with `disable-user-list` set to `true` and be using the fallback greeter in GDM3.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects gdm 3.4.1 and earlier versions.
- The issue was initially reported in Debian bug #683338.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2013-7273 by MITRE.
-  A patch was proposed but later reverted because it introduced a similar issue when login fails.
-  The fallback greeter that caused this issue has been dropped. The issue is resolved in later versions of gdm, specifically 3.8.3-1
- The bug also affects the handling of incorrect password attempts, leading to similar greeter issues.
