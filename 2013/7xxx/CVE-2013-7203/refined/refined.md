Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7203:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is incorrect file permission settings during the installation of gitolite. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the creation of world-writable and world-readable files by gitolite setup, dependent on the user umask.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **World-Writable Files:** During fresh installs, certain files were created with world-writable permissions.
*   **World-Readable Files:** Depending on the user's umask when running gitolite setup, world-readable files could be created, leading to information leakage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **World-Writable Files:** This could allow any local user on the system to modify gitolite's configuration or data, leading to potential compromise of the git repositories and server itself.
*   **World-Readable Files:** This could leak sensitive information about gitolite's configuration or the repositories it manages to any local user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker would need to have an account on the same system where gitolite is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the system where the vulnerable gitolite instance is running.
*   **No Privileges Required:**  No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, standard user account would suffice.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is present in older versions of gitolite, predating the fix for CVE-2013-4451. This necessitated the creation of a separate CVE ID.
*   The issue was categorized under CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions).
