{
  "cve": "CVE-2013-7051",
  "description": "The D-Link DIR-100 router has a weak authentication enforcement vulnerability. Once a user logs into the administration interface, the cli CGI is unlocked and can be used without further authentication. The only access check is if the IP address is the same.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `/cli.cgi` script does not properly check authentication parameters after initial login, relying only on matching IP addresses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-287: Improper Authentication"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as a logged-in administrator can execute privileged commands on the router without authenticating through the `/cli.cgi` interface.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the router's web interface.",
        "Attacker needs to be on the same network as a logged-in administrator."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.",
           "Must know the IP address of the router"
      ]
