Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stemmed from how gnome-shell handled keyboard input when the screen was locked. Specifically, if the Activities panel or the "Enter a command" dialog (Alt+F2) was open before the screen was locked, any subsequent keystrokes on the lock screen would be directed to these elements instead of the password prompt. This allowed for arbitrary command execution by a malicious actor by inputting commands while the screen was locked, effectively bypassing the screen lock.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Input Handling:** The core vulnerability was the failure to properly redirect keyboard input to the lock screen's password entry field when the screen was locked.
*   **Lack of Focus Control:** The input focus was not being correctly managed during the transition to a locked state, causing it to remain on the previously active elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the user's system, even when the screen was locked.
*   **Bypass of Screen Lock:** The vulnerability allowed complete bypass of the screen lock mechanism.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** If the attacker was able to execute privileged commands through this vulnerability, they could potentially gain complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker would need physical access to the target machine while it is locked.
*   **Pre-Existing Conditions:** The Activities panel or the "Enter a command" dialog had to be open *prior* to the screen being locked.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical access to the locked computer.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware that the vulnerability exists and how to exploit it (i.e. how to execute commands through the Activities panel or "Enter a command" dialog).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in older versions of gnome-shell, specifically affecting Fedora 18 and potentially 19.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that keyboard input is correctly redirected to the password prompt when the screen is locked. This was achieved through a series of commits to the `screenShield.js` file in gnome-shell.
*   The fix also included changes to how the screen shield is raised, making it more responsive.
*  The issue was resolved in gnome-shell version 3.7.92.
* There is a separate but related vulnerability (CVE-2013-7221) where the run command dialog remains visible above the lock screen, also allowing for command execution.
