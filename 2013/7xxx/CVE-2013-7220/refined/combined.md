209014b083dbe86ed0e0860a6016735571b56f94 ensures that the keypress
always goes to the login dialog box, while
127f10e7a8bbbbd089d217f8cd89971c187ae9c3 seems to be usability fix to me.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2013-11-14 12:41:34 UTC  ``` Fedora 18 is found to be vulnerable to the blind command execution on the lock screen, and Fedora 19 is found to execute command through "Enter the Command" dialog box at the lock screen.  The issue is that in Fedora 18, when you open either the Activities panel or "Enter a command" dialog box (Alt+F2), and then lock the screen or let the screensaver lock the screen, then if you start typing on the lock screen, instead of entering the password or just waking the screen, it actually types anything you type on the Activities panel or "Enter a command" dialog box, so anyone who enters a executable command and press enter, the command is executed even when the screen is locked.  In Fedora 19, the "Enter the Command" dialog box is visible even after you lock the screen, so anyone can write the commands in the box and execute them over a locked screen.  The issue is still to be fixed and tested on Gnome Fedora 18 and 19 machines. KDE version were not found to be affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c1)  Bastien Nocera    2013-11-14 12:44:43 UTC  ``` The Alt+F2 dialogue doesn't come from gnome-settings-daemon.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c2)  Ratul Gupta    2013-11-14 13:09:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to Bastien Nocera from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c1)) > The Alt+F2 dialogue doesn't come from gnome-settings-daemon.

The lock screen also doesn't live in gnome-settings-daemon. Which part of gnome-settings-daemon do you think might be at fault here?  I also couldn't reproduce this on F20.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c4)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-14 19:25:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Bastien Nocera from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c3)) > (In reply to Ratul Gupta from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c2)) > > (In reply to Bastien Nocera from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c1)) > > > The Alt+F2 dialogue doesn't come from gnome-settings-daemon. > >  > > The bug is not related to the Alt+F2 dialog box, but with the lock screen > > function itself. >  > The lock screen also doesn't live in gnome-settings-daemon. Which part of > gnome-settings-daemon do you think might be at fault here?  See [bug #1024786](show_bug.cgi?id=1024786) for the original report.  There are a few moving parts here -- it could be the lock screen functionality, it could be the search functionality in some way.  I can't say whether or not gnome-settings-daemon is incorrect or not; if you have a better suggestion of the component this may belong to, please feel free to advise.  We're not the GNOME experts and only have a (reproducable) bug to go on.   > I also couldn't reproduce this on F20.  So?  Fedora 18 and 19 are both still supported and should be looked at to see what the cause is and what probably fixed it for F20 (and whether that can be applied to F18/F19 to fix it there as well).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c5)  Vincent Danen    2013-11-14 19:32:52 UTC  ``` Taking another look at this, gnome-screensaver is probably _not_ the culprit as it is the same version on Fedora 18, 19, and 20 (3.6.1), unless it is due to an interaction with some other library that may have a different version between Fedora 19 and 20.  Unfortunately I don't have time to look into this further, but perhaps bringing this up with upstream and seeing if it affects GNOME3 on other platforms, would be a wise way of tracking the problem down.  Or maybe Ratul can bring this up on the oss-sec mailing list as well (in particular of F20 is no longer affected, upstream may no longer be affected also, if it ever was).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c7)  Bastien Nocera    2013-11-14 21:34:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c5)) > Taking another look at this, gnome-screensaver is probably _not_ the culprit > as it is the same version on Fedora 18, 19, and 20 (3.6.1), unless it is due > to an interaction with some other library that may have a different version > between Fedora 19 and 20.  gnome-screensaver is unused in GNOME sessions in F19 and F20.  > Unfortunately I don't have time to look into this further, but perhaps > bringing this up with upstream  I'm the gnome-settings-daemon maintainer upstream. I'll reassign this to gnome-shell where the Alt+F2 dialogue and the screensaver are implemented.  > and seeing if it affects GNOME3 on other > platforms, would be a wise way of tracking the problem down.  Or maybe Ratul > can bring this up on the oss-sec mailing list as well (in particular of F20 > is no longer affected, upstream may no longer be affected also, if it ever > was).  Some more details on how to reproduce the problem would certainly be helpful. What sort of session was this running? Do you have a video showing the problem?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c9)  Florian Müllner    2013-11-15 13:07:53 UTC  ``` Assuming that the issue is triggered by leaving the run dialog open when locking the screen, this was fixed upstream in <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=708218>, which should be easy to backport. Or is there a way to trigger the run dialog itself from the lock screen? In that case, the session log would probably provide useful pointers to the cause of the bug.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2013-11-15 13:56:38 UTC  ``` [Bug 1024786](show_bug.cgi?id=1024786) describe another vector using search in the activity screen (that's the "blind" part) that may have been fixed earlier.  Looking at the fix, is there really no proper way to implement screen locking other than building list of dialogs that may need closing?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c11)  Florian Müllner    2013-11-15 16:50:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c10)) > [Bug 1024786](show_bug.cgi?id=1024786) describe another vector using search in the activity screen > (that's the "blind" part) that may have been fixed earlier.  Since at least GNOME 3.8 (F19) locking the screen will fail if we cannot get a keyboard grab; this should make this situation impossible. More so, typing away at the lock screen will now trigger the unlock dialog (and redirect input to the password field).  So I very much doubt that this can be reproduced on newer versions.   > Looking at the fix, is there really no proper way to implement screen > locking other than building list of dialogs that may need closing?  Alternatively we could make sure that screen shield and unlock dialog are stacked above system dialogs, but then we'd need to special-case system dialogs that actually may show in a locked environment (for instance when asking for polkit authentication when a shutdown is requested from the login screen while other users have open sessions).   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c12)  Ratul Gupta    2013-11-18 12:28:00 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank M.Schwarz of resellerdesktop.de for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2013-11-18 12:47:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to Florian Müllner from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c11)) > Since at least GNOME 3.8 (F19) locking the screen will fail if we cannot get > a keyboard grab; this should make this situation impossible. More so, typing > away at the lock screen will now trigger the unlock dialog (and redirect > input to the password field).  Do you possibly have a reference (bug and/or commit) for that change handy?   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c15)  Florian Müllner    2013-11-18 15:32:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c13)) > Do you possibly have a reference (bug and/or commit) for that change handy?  Sure, <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686740>.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c16)  Tomas Hoger    2013-11-18 16:01:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Florian Müllner from [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c15)) > Sure, <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686740>.  I assume that bug is for:  > More so, typing away at the lock screen will now trigger the unlock dialog > (and redirect input to the password field).  I though this is the real reason 3.8 is no longer affected:  > Since at least GNOME 3.8 (F19) locking the screen will fail if we cannot get > a keyboard grab; this should make this situation impossible.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c18)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-12-27 04:52:32 UTC  ``` There are two distinct issues which are reported in the bug:  1. blind command execution via activities search keyboard focus 2. run command dialog visible above screen locker  Therefore it makes sense to split this bug into two parts. We will be using this bug for the first issue.  Description: The issue is that in Fedora 18, when you open either the Activities panel or "Enter a command" dialog box (Alt+F2), and then lock the screen or let the screensaver lock the screen, then if you start typing on the lock screen, instead of entering the password or just waking the screen, it actually types anything you type on the Activities panel or "Enter a command" dialog box, so anyone who enters a executable command and press enter, the command is executed even when the screen is locked.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c19)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-12-27 05:09:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c18))  > 2. run command dialog visible above screen locker  This issue is filed under:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1046839](show_bug.cgi?id=1046839 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2013-7221 gnome-shell: run command dialog visible above screen locker")   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c20)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-12-27 05:43:17 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved (as mentioned in [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c11)) by slightly changing the behaviour of gnome-shell with respect to how keystrokes are handled when the screensaver is on.  More details are available at: <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686740>  And a series of commits fix this issue via:  <https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/log/js/ui/screenShield.js?qt=grep&q=686740>  This issue was addressed in upstream release of gnome-shell-3.7.92  This issue does not affect the version of gnome-shell as shipped with Fedora-19 and Fedora-20.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1030431#c21)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-12-28 02:45:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned [CVE-2013-7220](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7220) as per:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/12/27/8>   ``` |  |

Subject: Two CVE request for gnome-shell/screensaver issues

Hi All,

I would like to request CVEs for two slightly related
gnome-shell/screensaver issues. Details as follows:

1. gnome-shell: blind command execution via activities search keyboard focus
The issue is that in Fedora 18, when you open either the Activities
panel or "Enter a command" dialog box (Alt+F2), and then lock the screen
or let the screensaver lock the screen, then if you start typing on the
lock screen, instead of entering the password or just waking the screen,
it actually types anything you type on the Activities panel or "Enter a
command" dialog box, so anyone who enters a executable command and press
enter, the command is executed even when the screen is locked.

<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=686740>

And a series of commits fix this issue via:

<https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/log/js/ui/screenShield.js?qt=grep&q=686740>

This issue was addressed in upstream release of gnome-shell-3.7.92

Reference: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1030431>

2. gnome-shell: run command dialog visible above screen locker
In Fedora 19, the "Enter the Command" dialog box is visible even after
you lock the screen, so anyone can write the commands in the box and
execute them over a locked screen.

Upstream bug:
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=708313>

Upstream patch:
<https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-shell/commit/js/ui/main.js?id=efdf1ff755943fba1f8a9aaeff77daa3ed338088>

This issue has been addressed in gnome-shell-3.10.0

Reference: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1046839>

Can two CVEs be please assigned to these issues?

Thanks!

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c0)  William Jon McCann    2012-10-23 22:41:36 UTC  ``` Many users of gnome-screensaver / gnome 2 are accustomed to being able to just type their password without looking when unlocking the screen. We don't allow this now with the new shield. Typing any characters just "bumps" up the shield a little bit. One user I observed today thought this was offensive - like it was mocking him or taunting him.  In my original conception of the lock shield I wanted typing to lift the shield. The reason for this is compatibility with existing practice and the fact that we don't need to guard the screen from stray touches when the input is purely keyboard based.  He also had no idea that escape lifted the shield at all. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c1)  Jakub Steiner    2012-10-23 22:59:31 UTC  ``` My original thought of just wanting to get to the notifications/music controls on a display in sleep by hitting a random key is easily worked around by using the Esc key as it toggles the shield on and off.  I've heard this complaint a number of times and there might be something about that trolling bit :) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c2)  Rui Matos    2012-10-24 00:37:57 UTC  ``` I agree with this. It's how the Windows 8 lock shield behaves FWIW. The timing is also important to reduce frustration IMO, see [bug 686745](show_bug.cgi?id=686745 "RESOLVED FIXED - screenShield: Tweak curtain animation timings"). ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c3)  Allan Day    2012-10-31 19:16:18 UTC  ``` Me, Jon and Jakub discussed this today. We agreed that the curtain should be raised when any key is pressed, with the exception of the shift keys.  There was some discussion about not raising for the return key, also, but I have to confess that I'm not 100% on that one.  It would also be good to not raise the curtain if the monitor is switched off. In this case, keyboard input would simply wake up the display. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c4)  Jasper St. Pierre (not reading bugmail)    2012-10-31 19:27:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c3)) > Me, Jon and Jakub discussed this today. We agreed that the curtain should be > raised when any key is pressed, with the exception of the shift keys.  Would the key you pressed to raise the lock screen also enter something into the password field? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c5)  Allan Day    2012-10-31 19:45:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c4)) > (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c3)) > > Me, Jon and Jakub discussed this today.

Good question. The password field should only accept entry once it is visible. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c6)  William Jon McCann    2012-10-31 20:07:34 UTC  ``` What we used to do in gnome-screensaver was save all the keystrokes in a buffer and forward them to the text entry once it became visible. I think think of a reason why we wouldn't want that. It ensures that those keys don't get sent to open windows in the case where the screen isn't locked too.  Maybe Ray has some thoughts. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c7)  Florian MÃ¼llner    2012-10-31 20:12:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c6)) > What we used to do in gnome-screensaver was save all the keystrokes in a buffer > and forward them to the text entry once it became visible.  Anything else doesn't make sense to me to be honest, in particular as passwords are masked by default (e.g. if input is dismissed until the entry becomes visible, users would need to count bullets or something to figure out what's in the entry) ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c8)  Guillaume Desmottes    2012-11-07 15:00:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c4)) > (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c3)) > > Me, Jon and Jakub discussed this today. We agreed that the curtain should be > > raised when any key is pressed, with the exception of the shift keys. >  > Would the key you pressed to raise the lock screen also enter something into > the password field?  Definitely. User should just has to enter his password and Enter to unlock, no need to type any extra key. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c9)  Matthias Clasen    2012-11-13 00:08:13 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 688203](show_bug.cgi?id=688203 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Unlocking with keyboard only is hard to discover") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c10)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2012-11-13 16:44:21 UTC  ``` > Maybe Ray has some thoughts.  A couple:  - with gnome-screensaver people would generally walk up to their machines and do one of:   1) hit escape, then type their password  2) hit space, then type their password  3) hit enter, then type their password  4) just start typing their password right away  We definitely used to queue up what they were typing, and replay it at the appropriate time. We also filtered out the initial space, escape, or enter key when doing the replay, because of the first three cases above.  Lastly, we filtered out Tab, and arrow keys with this comment:  /* Don't queue keys that may cause focus navigation in the dialog */  I think if gnome-shell mimiced the gnome-screensaver behavior, it would be more convenient than what it currently does.  - I do think it's important that media keys and the like don't raise the shield especially if there is an onscreen media control on the shield  - If there is something "focusable" on the screen and someone tries to navigate focus in it (say with alt-tab, tab, arrow keys, whatever), we shouldn't raise the shield but instead move focus to that, or move the focus around in that. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c11)  Jasper St. Pierre (not reading bugmail)    2012-12-08 08:03:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 231025](attachment.cgi?id=231025 "screenShield: Remove bump on key press") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=231025&action=edit "screenShield: Remove bump on key press") [[review]](review?bug=686740&attachment=231025) screenShield: Remove bump on key press  Any key press will now raise the shell. Note that the key press will not be forwarded to the entry yet. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c12)  Allan Day    2013-01-16 10:13:19 UTC  ``` Everything in [comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c10) sounds right to me. I guess that means that this still needs work. ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c13)  Allan Day    2013-02-28 10:23:10 UTC  ``` I thought this was fixed, but it seems that the patch hasn't been committed. Can we get this sorted for 3.8? ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c14)  Florian MÃ¼llner    2013-02-28 11:17:01 UTC  ``` Review of [attachment 231025](attachment.cgi?id=231025 "screenShield: Remove bump on key press") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=231025&action=edit "screenShield: Remove bump on key press") [[review]](review?bug=686740&attachment=231025):  (In reply to [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c13)) > I thought this was fixed, but it seems that the patch hasn't been committed. > Can we get this sorted for 3.8?  I'd like to see that, but in my opinion we need forwarding to the entry - with this patch, starting to type will appear to do the right thing (raise the shield and start the password conversation), but only the former is true, so users will end up with an authentication failure unless they learn to type the first letter twice. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=686740#c15)  Jasper St. Pierre (not reading bugmail)    2013-02-28 14:48:03 UTC  ``` The reason was because of IBus support, but it's been acknowledged that we don't want that in the password entry.
