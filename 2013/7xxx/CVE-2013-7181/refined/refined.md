Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-7181

**Description:**

The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in Fortinet Fortiweb 5.0.3, and potentially earlier versions. Specifically, the "filter" parameter on the "/user/ldap\_user/add" page is vulnerable.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected XSS (CWE-79):** The application doesn't properly encode or sanitize user-provided data before displaying it on the page, leading to the possibility of executing injected scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session.
*   **Potential for Various Attacks:** Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection, or other malicious actions depending on the attacker's script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the "filter" parameter. The user's browser then executes the script when the vulnerable page is loaded with the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the "filter" parameter of the "/user/ldap\_user/add" page is vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attack typically requires the victim to click on a malicious link or visit a website that delivers the malicious request.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by William Costa.
*   Fortinet has released version 5.1.0 to address the vulnerability (FG-IR-14-002).
*   Workarounds include restricting access to trusted networks, however, this does not prevent XSS attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host.
