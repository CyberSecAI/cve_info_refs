The way certificate check was implemented to fix CVE-2013-2073 was
incorrect (check was done on "probe" connection, but not the actual
connection used to transfer data).  This should now be fixed in 0.10
(I can't confirm atm), which switches to use urllib3 with proper
certificate checks.

This should get a new CVE.

# transifex-client: insufficient CVE-2013-2073 fix #42

## Description

[![@thoger](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4051912?v=4&size=48)](/thoger)[thoger](https://github.com/thoger)opened [on Oct 30, 2013](https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/issues/42#issue-21815186)

Commit [e24ea95](https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/commit/e24ea954373874962f22f63a7311d04d6ff56d84) (plus few follow up commits) was added to add verification of HTTPS certificate to avoid MITM attacks. The issue got [CVE-2013-2073](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7m2p-hrg9-pw87 "CVE-2013-2073") assigned.

However, the fix is not really correct. The way it works is:

* verify\_ssl opens connection to the target host and verifies provided certificate, including name check
* connection opened by verify\_ssl is closed immediately
* actual communication with the server is done via urllib2, which opens its own connection(s)

So the actual data is sent over unverified connections opened by urllib2. MITM attacker should be able to steal all transferred data by allowing "probe" connection opened by verify\_ssl to connect to the real transifex server and only intercept subsequent urllib2 connection.

To have two CVEs assigned in response to two different patches for the
same security problem, it's generally necessary for the first patch to
fix some aspect of the problem. If the first patch accomplished
nothing, a total of only one CVE is used.

Here, it seems that the first patch might help with a situation in
which the attacker doesn't have complete man-in-the-middle access, but
the attacker can replace the server. In that case, the attacker
perhaps can't avoid having the probe connection and the later
connection go to the same server. Because of that, checking only the
probe connection might have a security benefit.

(<https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/issues/42> says "MITM
attacker should be able to steal all transferred data by allowing
"probe" connection opened by verify_ssl to connect to the real
transifex server and only intercept subsequent urllib2 connection.")

Use CVE-2013-7110 for the vulnerability in the "actual connection used
to transfer data."

If the above analysis is incorrect, and there are absolutely no cases
in which the original patch had any security benefit, we will reject
one of the two CVEs.
