Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7110:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect implementation of certificate verification in the Transifex command-line client. Although a previous fix (related to CVE-2013-2073) attempted to address the lack of certificate verification, it was flawed. The initial "fix" performed certificate validation on a "probe" connection but not on the actual connections used for data transfer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is that the Transifex client uses `urllib2` to perform the actual data transfer after a probe connection is made. The `urllib2` connections did not perform proper certificate validation, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
Specifically:
*   **Incorrect certificate validation**:  The initial fix verified the certificate on a "probe" connection but failed to apply the validation to the subsequent connection used for data transfer.
*   **Usage of `urllib2`**: The underlying issue stems from the use of  `urllib2`, which opens connections that are not verified.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A man-in-the-middle attacker could intercept the unverified `urllib2` connections, allowing them to:
*   **Spoof the Transifex server**: By presenting an arbitrary certificate, an attacker can impersonate the Transifex server.
*   **Steal transferred data**: The attacker could eavesdrop on all data transmitted between the client and the real server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and the server can intercept the communication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker must have the ability to:
*   Intercept network traffic between the Transifex client and the Transifex server.
*   Present a fraudulent certificate to the client during the `urllib2` connections, while still allowing the probe connection to reach the legitimate server.

**Additional notes:**
* The initial fix for CVE-2013-2073 did provide some partial benefit as stated by MITRE, as it could potentially prevent attacks when the attacker is not in complete control of the network and can not spoof the initial probe connection.
*   The fix for CVE-2013-7110 was to switch to `urllib3`, which includes proper certificate checks.
*  The issue was tracked at  <https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/issues/42> and the fix was implemented via <https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/commit/6d69d61>
