**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-80)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context.
- Session hijacking is possible.
- Unwanted actions can be triggered via the web interface (e.g., sending mail, deleting data).

**Attack vectors:**
- Embedding malicious JavaScript code within a mail filter rule's title.
- An attacker could achieve this through social engineering, or by leveraging other vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify mail filter rules, or to have malicious content placed at the vulnerable location. This might require some level of access to the user's account.
