Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the BSSGP (Base Station Subsystem GPRS Protocol) dissector of Wireshark. A malformed BSSGP packet can trigger a crash in the dissector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The BSSGP dissector has a flaw that can lead to a crash when processing a crafted or malformed packet. This indicates a lack of proper input validation or error handling within the dissector code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause Wireshark to crash. This can lead to denial of service for a user attempting to analyze network traffic.
- In some scenarios, it may also be possible to cause the execution of arbitrary code, although this is not explicitly stated as a direct impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered either by injecting a malformed packet onto the network or by opening a malformed packet trace file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to inject or transmit a specifically crafted BSSGP packet onto the network being analyzed by a vulnerable Wireshark instance.
- Alternatively, an attacker could also send a malicious packet capture file to a Wireshark user.
- No specific position is required.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Laurent Butti.
- This vulnerability was assigned the identifier `wnpa-sec-2013-67` by the Wireshark project.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark version 1.10.4.
- The issue is also tracked as bug #9488 in the Wireshark bug tracker.
