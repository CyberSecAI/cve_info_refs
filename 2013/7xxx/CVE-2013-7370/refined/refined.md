{
  "CVE-2013-7370": {
    "Description": "XSS in the Sencha Labs Connect middleware before 2.8.1 for Node.js allows attacks via an HTTP request with a crafted method name containing JavaScript code.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The methodOverride middleware in node-connect did not properly sanitize the HTTP method name before using it in a 404 error message, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the 404 error page, which can then be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious method name via the `_method` parameter or the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
