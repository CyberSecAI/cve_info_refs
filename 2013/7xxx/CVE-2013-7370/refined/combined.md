| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1091166#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-04-25 05:23:59 UTC  ``` The Node Security Project reports:  methodOverride Middleware Reflected Cross-Site Scripting  Connect is a stack of middleware that is executed in order in each request.  The "methodOverride" middleware allows the http post to override the method of  the request with the value of the "_method" post key or with the header  "x-http-method-override".  Because the user post input was not checked, req.method could contain any kind  of value. Because the req.method did not match any common method VERB, connect  answered with a 404 page containing the "Cannot [method] [url]" content. The  method was not properly encoded for output in the browser.  ===  nodejs-connect 2.8.0 is vulnerable to this, an incomplete fix was applied,  version 2.8.1 is also vulnerable, versions 2.8.2 and later have been corrected.  Please note that the first attempt to fix this was not complete and requires a second fix:  First fix: <https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/277e5aad6a95d00f55571a9a0e11f2fa190d8135> Second fix: <https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/126187c4e12162e231b87350740045e5bb06e93a>  The incomplete fix for this resulted in a second vulnerability referred to as  [CVE-2013-7371](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7371).  External references: <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/methodOverride_Middleware_Reflected_Cross-Site_Scripting> <https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/831> <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=744374> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q2/151>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1091166#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2014-08-15 04:59:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of nodejs-connect as shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1091166#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-04-25 05:23:59 UTC  ``` The Node Security Project reports:  methodOverride Middleware Reflected Cross-Site Scripting  Connect is a stack of middleware that is executed in order in each request.  The "methodOverride" middleware allows the http post to override the method of  the request with the value of the "_method" post key or with the header  "x-http-method-override".  Because the user post input was not checked, req.method could contain any kind  of value. Because the req.method did not match any common method VERB, connect  answered with a 404 page containing the "Cannot [method] [url]" content. The  method was not properly encoded for output in the browser.  ===  nodejs-connect 2.8.0 is vulnerable to this, an incomplete fix was applied,  version 2.8.1 is also vulnerable, versions 2.8.2 and later have been corrected.  Please note that the first attempt to fix this was not complete and requires a second fix:  First fix: <https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/277e5aad6a95d00f55571a9a0e11f2fa190d8135> Second fix: <https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/126187c4e12162e231b87350740045e5bb06e93a>  The incomplete fix for this resulted in a second vulnerability referred to as  [CVE-2013-7371](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7371).  External references: <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/methodOverride_Middleware_Reflected_Cross-Site_Scripting> <https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/831> <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=744374> <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q2/151>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1091166#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2014-08-15 04:59:15 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of nodejs-connect as shipped with Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Moderate security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=875166#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-04-25 09:33:29 UTC  ``` The Node Security Project reported the following issue:  Overview:  Connect is a stack of middleware that is executed in order in each request.  The "methodOverride" middleware allows the http post to override the method of the request with the value of the "_method" post key or with the header "x-http-method-override".  Because the user post input was not checked, req.method could contain any kind of value. Because the req.method did not match any common method VERB, connect answered with a 404 page containing the "Cannot [method] [url]" content. The method was not properly encoded for output in the browser.  First fix: escape req.method output <https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/277e5aad6a95d00f55571a9a0e11f2fa190d8135>  Second fix: whitelist <https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/126187c4e12162e231b87350740045e5bb06e93a>  CVE-2013-7370 was assigned to this issue.  We need fixes for:  openSUSE:12.3 and openSUSE:13.1 + Factory  References: <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/methodOverride_Middleware_Reflected_Cross-Site_Scripting> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1091166> <http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2013/CVE-2013-7370.html> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7370> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=875166#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-04-25 22:00:11 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=875166#c3)  Jordi Massaguer   2014-04-28 15:09:54 UTC  ``` those patches are for 2.x version. We have a 0.x version in openSUSE. The code mentioned on those patches do not even exist. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=875166#c5)  Jordi Massaguer   2014-04-28 15:44:02 UTC  ``` This issue is for the connect middleware that comes bundled in nodejs 2.x (connect overrides http.createServer method).  I tried this code with nodejs that comes in openSUSE 13.1:     require('connect')  and the answer is    Cannot find module 'connect'  This confirms that our nodejs does not include the connect middleware code.  The same for openSUSE 12.3 ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=875166#c7)  Jordi Massaguer   2014-04-28 15:44:41 UTC  ``` can we close this bug? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=875166#c8)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-04-28 16:46:44 UTC  ``` Perfect! Thanks Jordi. I will close this now. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=875166#c9)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-04-28 16:49:15 UTC  ``` Closing bug, as we're not affected by this issue. ``` |  |
