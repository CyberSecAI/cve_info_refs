## Description

[![@mcgwiz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/627599?u=32c39f91efc8aecc0c6714716938a7edd5c7dbec&v=4&size=48)](/mcgwiz)[mcgwiz](https://github.com/mcgwiz)opened [on Oct 31, 2013](https://github.com/klaussilveira/gitlist/issues/395#issue-21876173)

In many circles, it is conventional to use backticks in names of C# files containing generic classes. Accessing a file with a backtick in the name causes the following error to be displayed:

> Oops! sh: 1: Syntax error: EOF in backquote substitution

Accessing a file with two backticks in the name, such as `Source/filename`enclosed`.txt` yields:

> Oops! sh: 1: enclosed: not found fatal: Path 'Source/filename.txt' does not exist in 'master'
