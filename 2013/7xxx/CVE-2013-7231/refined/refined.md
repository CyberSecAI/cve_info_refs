Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities addressed by the ArcGIS 10.2 for Server Security Patch (September 2013):

**1. Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - **Root Cause:** A persistent XSS vulnerability exists within the application.
   - **Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed in the context of other users' browsers.
   - **Impact:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or further exploitation.
   - **Attack Vectors:** This requires administrative access to exploit.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires administrative privileges.

**2. Arbitrary File Upload**
   - **Root Cause:** The application allows authenticated administrators to upload files without proper validation.
   - **Weaknesses:** Lack of file type restrictions allows an attacker to upload any type of file, including potentially unsafe executables or scripts.
   - **Impact:** An attacker can upload malicious files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution or other malicious activities.
   - **Attack Vectors:** File upload functionality accessible to administrators.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires administrative privileges and a valid authenticated session.

**3. SQL Injection Vulnerability**
   - **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
   - **Weaknesses:** Improper handling of user input in SQL queries allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
   - **Impact:** An attacker could potentially modify or access data without authorization, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation or denial of service.
   - **Attack Vectors:**  SQL injection occurs in map and feature services that utilize relational databases.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires network access to the map and feature services.

**4. HTTP GET Token Exposure**
    - **Root Cause**: ArcGIS for Server allows tokens to be acquired through HTTP GET requests.
    - **Weaknesses**:  HTTP GET requests expose credentials in the request URL in plain text format.
    - **Impact:** Credentials exposed in the URL could be stored in browser history or in network components, leading to unauthorized access.
    - **Attack Vectors**: HTTP GET requests to obtain tokens.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Network sniffing capabilities or access to browser history.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The patch also includes a new security option to disable token acquisition via HTTP GET requests, which is a mitigation measure against the HTTP GET Token Exposure issue.
*   The patch addresses several other issues that are not directly security vulnerabilities: NIM094481 and NIM097252.
