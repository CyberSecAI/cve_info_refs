## Fixing security vulnerabilities (27th Dec 2013)

Several serious security flaws have been discovered which affect **all prior versions** of Fat Free CRM.

### Impact

This includes the following:

* several SQL injection attack points (via the homepage timeline and activity features - requires user to be logged in to perform an attack) CVE-2013-7225
* leakage of user data including password hashes and salts (logged in users are able to view password hashes of other users via json requests.) CVE-2013-7224 and CVE-2013-7249
* lack of support for cycling the Rails session secret (Users are now forced to run rake ffcrm:secret when setting up a new instance) see CVE-2013-7222
* `protect_from_forgery` was turned off by default CVE-2013-7223

### Releases

Please upgrade your instance immediately to the latest gem versions **0.13.0** and **0.12.1** or grab the latest code from the github master branch. Note: you will be required to run "rake ffcrm:secret" before the server will restart. This will generate a new secret token for you in config/initializers/secret\_token.rb

For those who are unable to upgrade, please use the workarounds section below to patch your existing system.

### Ongoing security work and reporting

We will be conducting a security audit over the next little while to review the codebase for flaws.

It's no secret that the FFCRM codebase is very old in parts and desperately needs an overhaul. For those who are willing, we'd welcome the help. If you build your business on this, we'd ask you to consider giving back time and effort. Currently, this is entirely a volunteer maintained project.

**For those who do find serious flaws, for the time being, please report discretely to steveyken@gmail.com**

### Workarounds

For those who are unable to upgrade, the following procedures should be applied to patch your existing system. You can either patch your code by cherry-picking the following commits or follow the manual procedure further below.

```
git fetch origin
git cherry-pick 93c182dd4c6f3620b721d2a15ba6a6ecab5669df   # Strengthen case to generate unique secret token.
git cherry-pick a7fedbb36388bad0c0f32b2346481e0ea126dea6   # Ensure requests are protected
git cherry-pick cf26a04b356ad2161c4c6160260eb870a3de5328   # Add custom serializers for xml and json.
git cherry-pick 078035f1ef73ed85285ac9d128c3c5f670cef066   # Fixed sql injection in timeline method.
git cherry-pick d4b2de81a4d8c1b201482edcb2488ed9280a65fd   # Refactor activity_user to remove possible SQL injection points.

```

#### Manual updates

1.. Rotate your secret token (if you haven't already, i.e. don't use the default version that Fat Free CRM provides.) Note: this is true of any other rails project you 'clone' from a public source.

To do this manually, open `irb` and type the following:

```
require 'securerandom'
SecureRandom.hex(64)

```

Then paste the result into `config/initializers/secret_token.rb`.

Note: the main reason for cycling this in your own project is that the secret token should not be publicly visible. If it's checked in on your github fork, it is publicly visible. More reading here: <http://robertheaton.com/2013/07/22/how-to-hack-a-rails-app-using-its-secret-token/>

2.. Add `protect_from_forgery` to ApplicationController.

In `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`, change add `protect_from_forgery` to the beginning of the class. This will prevent many types of CSRF attacks.

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

  protect_from_forgery

  ...rest of file

```

3.. Add the following method to your user class (before the private declaration) to stop important details being leaked via json. This is particularly serious as it enables any logged in user to view the password hash/salt of any other user. (Note: this does NOT disclose plain text passwords but, regardless, is still very serious.)

In `app/models/users/user.rb`, add the following lines above the 'private' keyword.

```
  def to_json(options = nil)
    [name].to_json
  end

  def to_xml(options = nil)
    [name].to_xml
  end

```

In `config/routes.rb`, change

```
resources :users, :id => /\d+/ do

```

to

```
resources :users, :id => /\d+/, :except => [:index, :destroy] do

```

4.. Patch the following code in `app/controllers/home_controller.rb`

This replaces two methods that had SQL injection vulnerabilities with code that sanitizes user input properly.

* Replace the `timeline` method with:

```
  def timeline
    state = params[:state].to_s
    if %w(Collapsed Expanded).include?(state)
      if (model_type = params[:type].to_s).present?
        if %w(comment email).include?(model_type)
          model = model_type.camelize.constantize
          item = model.find(params[:id])
          item.update_attribute(:state, state)
        end
      else
        comments, emails = params[:id].split("+")
        Comment.where(:id => comments.split(',')).update_all(:state => state) unless comments.blank?
        Email.where(:id => emails.split(',')).update_all(:state => state) unless emails.blank?
      end
    end

    render :nothing => true
  end

```

* and replace the `activity_user` method with

```
def activity_user
    user = current_user.pref[:activity_user]
    if user && user != "all_users"
      user = if user =~ /@/ # email
          User.where(:email => user).first
        else # first_name middle_name last_name any_name
          name_query = if user.include?(" ")
            user.name_permutations.map{ |first, last|
              User.where(:first_name => first, :last_name => last)
            }.map(&:to_a).flatten.first
          else
            [User.where(:first_name => user), User.where(:last_name => user)].map(&:to_a).flatten.first
          end
        end
    end
    user.is_a?(User) ? user.id : nil
  end

```

Please note: these methods are slated for an upgrade soon. Whilst it's tempting to refactor more fully right now, the focus has to be on locking them down with minimal changes for you.

> <https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/commit/93c182dd4c6f3620b721d2a15ba6a6ecab5669df>

Use CVE-2013-7222.

> 2. Lack of CSRF Protection
> <https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/commit/a7fedbb36388bad0c0f32b2346481e0ea126dea6>

Use CVE-2013-7223.

> 3. Default to_json for models
> <https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/commit/cf26a04b356ad2161c4c6160260eb870a3de5328>

Use CVE-2013-7224.

> 4. Multiple SQL Injections
> <https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/commit/078035f1ef73ed85285ac9d128c3c5f670cef066>
> <https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/commit/d4b2de81a4d8c1b201482edcb2488ed9280a65fd>

Use CVE-2013-7225.

For item 3: if there is an information-disclosure vulnerability
involving to_xml, please let us know and we can assign an additional
CVE ID. The joernchen advisory mentioned only to_json, and therefore
to_xml has a different discoverer and may require a separate CVE ID.

If there is a denial of service issue involving :delete, please let us
know and we can assign an additional CVE ID. The joernchen advisory
mentioned only "renders JSON requests with a full JSON object," and
therefore :delete has a different discoverer and may require a
separate CVE ID.

# Happy Holidays / Xmas Advisory

---

*From*: joernchen <joernchen () phenoelit de>

*Date*: Tue, 24 Dec 2013 11:26:15 +0100

---

```
To whom it may concern:

A rather informal advisory on Fat Free CRM (<http://fatfreecrm.com/>):

Timeline:
Aug 27th 2013 Initial email containing the findings listed below
         including a note that there more vulnerabilities
         which just need to be verified. (Send to
         mike () fatfreecrm com and security () fatfreecrm com)

Sep 16th 2013 No response so far (not even a bounce of the initial
         mail), re-send email of Aug. 27th.

Dec 20th 2013 Still no response.

Dec 24th 2013 Public Disclosure.

Hint: Actually the codebase is full of Ruby on Rails worst practices.
      You might want to use it as a sample "Hack Me" application.

---
1. Known Session Secret

In config/initialiers/secret_token.rb a static secret token is defined,
with the knowledge of this token an attacker is able to execute
arbitrary Ruby code server side.

2. Lack of CSRF Protection

In app/controllers/application_controller.rb the protect_from_forgery
statement is missing, therefore Fat Free CRM is vulnerable to CSRF
attacks.

3. Default to_json for models

The users controller renders JSON requests with a full JSON object:
For instance when being logged in to the demo app and requesting
<http://demo.fatfreecrm.com/users/1.json>, the response would be

{

    "user": {
        "admin": true,
        "aim": "",
        "alt_email": "",
        "company": "example",
        "created_at": "2012-02-12T02:00:00+02:00",
        "current_login_at": "2013-08-26T22:12:05+03:00",
        "current_login_ip": "61.143.60.146",
        "deleted_at": null,
        "email": "aaron () example com",
        "first_name": "Aaron",
        "google": "",
        "id": 1,
        "last_login_at": "2013-08-24T22:20:06+03:00",
        "last_login_ip": "122.173.185.99",
        "last_name": "Assembler",
        "last_request_at": "2013-08-26T22:13:35+03:00",
        "login_count": 481,
        "mobile": "(800)555-1211",
        "password_hash":

        "perishable_token": "NE0n6wUCumVNdQ24ahRu",
        "persistence_token":
"d7cdeffd3625f7cb265b21126b85da7c930d47c4a708365c20eb857560055a6b57c9775becb8a957dfdb46df8aee17eb120a011b380e9cc0882f9dfaa2b7ba26",
        "phone": "(800)555-1210",
        "single_access_token": "TarXlrOPfaokNOzls2U8",
        "skype": "ranzitreddy",
        "suspended_at": null,
        "title": "VP of Sales",
        "updated_at": "2013-08-26T22:13:35+03:00",
        "username": "aaron",
        "yahoo": ""
    }

}

A custom to_json method which sanitizes the output should be created.

4. Multiple SQL Injections

In app/controllers/home_controller.rb:

  def timeline
    unless params[:type].empty?
      model = params[:type].camelize.constantize
      item = model.find(params[:id])
      item.update_attribute(:state, params[:state])
    else
      comments, emails = params[:id].split("+")
      Comment.update_all("state = '#{params[:state]}'", "id IN
(#{comments})") unless comments.blank?
      Email.update_all("state = '#{params[:state]}'", "id IN
(#{emails})") unless emails.blank?
    end

    render :nothing => true
  end

Here params[:state], comments and emails are attacker controlled values
which go directly into SQL statements. Therefore this piece of code
exposes a SQL Injection vulnerability.
