Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-7064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering and validation of configuration values entered by administrators within the "EU Cookie Compliance" module for Drupal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper sanitization of configuration input allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- XSS attacks: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the site through configuration settings. The impact of this is not explicitly detailed in the text, but could include stealing user cookies/session tokens, redirecting to attacker-controlled sites, defacement, or other client-side attacks, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "EU Cookie Compliance" module's configuration interface. An attacker needs access to this interface to inject the malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a role with the permission "Administer EU Cookie Compliance popup". This means the attacker must have administrative privileges with specific permissions to access the affected module's settings page.

**Additional Notes**

- This vulnerability is considered unusual by the CVE assignment team, as it involves crafted configuration settings by admins. Typically, this isn't considered a vulnerability unless it leads to privilege escalation (which this case doesn't explicitly detail).
- The CVE assignment team indicates the vendor is allowed to have a threat model that includes this type of attack.
- The mail from the CVE assignment team mentions that the XSS attack can realistically result in privilege escalation to a higher-level admin account.
