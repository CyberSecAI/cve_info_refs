{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The file utility's rule for detecting AWK scripts used a regular expression with two star operators, which could lead to excessive backtracking in the regex engine when processing files with many newlines or similar patterns. This could cause a denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inefficient regular expression",
      "Excessive backtracking vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service; the file utility could use 100% CPU while processing a crafted input file or file with many newlines due to extensive backtracking in the regex engine used for detecting AWK scripts.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Providing a specially crafted file to the 'file' utility or a program using libmagic.",
      "Providing a file with many newlines or similar patterns that cause excessive backtracking when analysed by 'file' or a program using libmagic."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to provide input to the 'file' utility or a program using libmagic."
    ],
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability was triggered by a regular expression used to identify AWK scripts. The excessive backtracking was due to a poorly formed regular expression with two star operators. Upstream fix limits repetition to 100 to avoid the issue. The vulnerability was present in file version 5.05 and later until patched. The issue also affected PHP applications using the fileinfo extension. It was discovered by Mike Frysinger."
