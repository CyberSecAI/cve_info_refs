Debian Security Advisory DSA-2873-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Salvatore Bonaccorso

Package        : file
Vulnerability  : several
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-2270
Debian Bug     : 703993

Several vulnerabilities have been found in file, a file type
classification tool.

Aaron Reffett reported a flaw in the way the file utility determined the
type of Portable Executable (PE) format files, the executable format
used on Windows. When processing a defective or intentionally prepared
PE executable which contains invalid offset information, the
file_strncmp routine will access memory that is out of bounds, causing
file to crash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ID
CVE-2014-2270 has been assigned to identify this flaw.

Mike Frysinger reported that file's rule for detecting AWK scripts
significantly slows down file. The regular expression to detect AWK
files contained two star operators, which could be exploited to cause
excessive backtracking in the regex engine.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.04-5+squeeze4.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.11-2+deb7u2.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:5.17-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:5.17-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your file packages.

A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted CDF file,  which once inspected by the file utility of the victim would lead to file executable crash.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-15 11:15:14 UTC  ``` This CVE was assigned to an incorrect boundary check in the cdf_read_short_sector() function.  The issue was corrected as part of this upstream commit:  <https://github.com/file/file/commit/6d209c1c489457397a5763bca4b28e43aac90391#diff-0>  The boundary check was added as part of the [CVE-2012-1571](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1571) fix (see [bug 805197](show_bug.cgi?id=805197 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1571 file: out of bounds read in CDF parser")).  The [CVE-2014-0207](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0207) is really an incomplete / insufficient [CVE-2012-1571](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1571) fix CVE and hence does not affected file packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and php53 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and php packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, which did not get the incomplete fix applied.  Future updates addressing [CVE-2012-1571](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1571) will use complete fix.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c11)  Remi Collet    2014-05-22 14:07:29 UTC  ``` PHP upstream bug <https://bugs.php.net/67326>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c14)  Francisco Alonso    2014-06-30 06:11:20 UTC  ```  Created php tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1114441](show_bug.cgi?id=1114441 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0207 php: file: cdf_read_short_sector insufficient boundary check [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c15)  Francisco Alonso    2014-06-30 06:11:24 UTC  ```  Created file tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1114440](show_bug.cgi?id=1114440 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0207 file: cdf_read_short_sector insufficient boundary check [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c16)  Fedora Update System    2014-07-05 14:53:28 UTC  ``` file-5.19-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

Subject: file: possible DoS in awk magic

```
Package: file
Version: 5.04-5+squeeze2
Severity: important
Tags: security, patch

Hi,

there's a DoS risk in the magic for awk scripts, which causes excessive
runtimes of `file` on files which cause lots of backtracking in the regex
engine, like files with many, many newlines:
# dd ibs=1000000 count=1 if=/dev/zero | tr '\0' '\n' > newlines
# time file newlines
newlines: ASCII text
real    3m51.005s
user    3m50.418s
sys     0m0.124s

There is a bugreport and Patch at the upstream bugtracker:
<http://bugs.gw.com/view.php?id=164>

In Squeeze, the culprit awk-magic comes from debian/patches/101-magic-update-
awk.patch. In wheezy, sid and experimental, the regex is part of upstream's
magic/Magdir/commands.

Cheers,
Carsten

JPEG or TIFF file could cause a PHP application using the exif\_thumbnail()
function to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3670)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the way PHP parsed DNS
responses. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could
use these flaws to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of a PHP application that uses the dns\_get\_record() function.
(CVE-2014-4049, CVE-2014-3597)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the File Information
(fileinfo) extension. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a
PHP application using fileinfo to consume an excessive amount of CPU and
possibly crash. (CVE-2013-7345, CVE-2014-0237, CVE-2014-0238,
CVE-2014-1943, CVE-2014-3538)

Multiple boundary check flaws were found in the File Information
(fileinfo) extension. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a
PHP application using fileinfo to crash. (CVE-2014-0207, CVE-2014-2270,
CVE-2014-3478, CVE-2014-3479, CVE-2014-3480, CVE-2014-3487, CVE-2014-3587,
CVE-2014-3710)

A type confusion issue was found in PHP's phpinfo() function. A malicious
script author could possibly use this flaw to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4721)

A type confusion issue was found in the SPL ArrayObject and
SPLObjectStorage classes' unserialize() method. A remote attacker able to
submit specially crafted input to a PHP application, which would then
unserialize this input using one of the aforementioned methods, could use
this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
that PHP application. (CVE-2014-3515)

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the way PHP handled certain Standard
PHP Library (SPL) Iterators and ArrayIterators. A malicious script author
could possibly use either of these flaws to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4670, CVE-2014-4698)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way custom objects were
unserialized. Specially crafted input processed by the unserialize()
function could cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2014-3669)

It was found that PHP's gd extension did not properly handle file names
with a null character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
make a PHP application access unexpected files and bypass intended file
system access restrictions. (CVE-2014-5120)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the gdImageCreateFromXpm()
function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash a PHP application using gd via a specially crafted X PixMap (XPM)
file. (CVE-2014-2497)

A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way the DateInterval class parsed
interval specifications. An attacker able to make a PHP application parse a
specially crafted specification using DateInterval could possibly cause the
PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2013-6712)

An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way the xmlrpc extension parsed
dates in the ISO 8601 format. A specially crafted XML-RPC request or
response could possibly cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2014-3668)

The CVE-2014-0207, CVE-2014-0237, CVE-2014-0238, CVE-2014-3478,
CVE-2014-3479, CVE-2014-3480, CVE-2014-3487, and CVE-2014-3710 issues were
discovered by Francisco Alonso of Red Hat Product Security; the
CVE-2014-3538 issue was discovered by Jan Kaluža of the Red Hat Web Stack
Team; the CVE-2014-3597 issue was discovered by David Kutálek of Red Hat
BaseOS QE.
