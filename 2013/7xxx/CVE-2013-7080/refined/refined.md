Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the deprecated `feuser_adminLib.inc` library in TYPO3 extensions. This library is used to create records.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Mass Assignment:** Extensions using the `feuser_adminLib.inc` library are susceptible to mass assignment. This means that when creating records, an attacker can manipulate the generated links to fill any field in the database table with arbitrary values, even those not intended to be directly modified by user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary values into database fields when creating records. This is not limited to the fields in the configuration or the link itself.
- This can lead to data corruption, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities depending on the targeted database fields.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the links generated by the `feuser_adminLib.inc` library when creating records.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the part of the application that uses the vulnerable library to create records and manipulate the generated links.
- This could potentially be an unauthenticated user if the vulnerable functionality is exposed publicly. However, the CVSS score suggests it may require some form of authentication or be of medium complexity.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `feuser_adminLib.inc` library was deprecated and removed in TYPO3 versions 6.1 and later.
- Despite the deprecation, the issue was fixed in older versions.
- Extension developers were urged not to use the deprecated library anymore.
