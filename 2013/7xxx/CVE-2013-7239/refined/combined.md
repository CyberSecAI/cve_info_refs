# USN-2080-1: Memcached vulnerabilities

13 January 2014

Several security issues were fixed in Memcached.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 13.04](/security/notices?release=raring)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [memcached](/security/cves?package=memcached) - A high-performance memory object caching system

## Details

Stefan Bucur discovered that Memcached incorrectly handled certain large

body lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause Memcached to

crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4971](/security/CVE-2011-4971))

Jeremy Sowden discovered that Memcached incorrectly handled logging certain

details when the -vv option was used. An attacker could use this issue to

cause Memcached to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0179](/security/CVE-2013-0179))

It was discovered that Memcached incorrectly handled SASL authentication.

A remote attacker could use this issue to bypass SASL authentication

completely. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.10, Ubuntu 13.04 and Ubuntu

13.10. ([CVE-2013-7239](/security/CVE-2013-7239))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.14-0ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.14-0ubuntu4.1)

##### Ubuntu 13.04

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.14-0ubuntu1.13.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.14-0ubuntu1.13.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.14-0ubuntu1.12.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.14-0ubuntu1.12.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [memcached](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached)
  -
  [1.4.13-0ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/memcached/1.4.13-0ubuntu2.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : memcached
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4971 CVE-2013-7239
Debian Bug     : 706426 733643

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in memcached, a high-performance
memory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2011-4971

    Stefan Bucur reported that memcached could be caused to crash by
    sending a specially crafted packet.

CVE-2013-7239

    It was reported that SASL authentication could be bypassed due to a
    flaw related to the managment of the SASL authentication state. With
    a specially crafted request, a remote attacker may be able to
    authenticate with invalid SASL credentials.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.5-1+deb6u1. Note that the patch for CVE-2013-7239 was not
applied for the oldstable distribution as SASL support is not enabled in
this version. This update also provides the fix for CVE-2013-0179 which
was fixed for stable already.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.13-0.2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
