Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-7239:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an error in how Memcached handles SASL authentication state management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect handling of SASL authentication, allowing bypass.
- Specifically, a second request with bad SASL credentials after an initial failed request results in successful authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can bypass SASL authentication completely, gaining unauthorized access to the memcached service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can send specially crafted requests to the memcached server to exploit the SASL authentication bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the memcached service.
- No prior authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
- This issue specifically affects Ubuntu 12.10, 13.04 and 13.10.
- The Debian security advisory states that the vulnerability allows authentication with invalid SASL credentials.
