Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an invalid free flaw within the `getaddrinfo()` function in the glibc library. This flaw specifically occurs when the `AI_IDN` flag is used in conjunction with glibc being compiled with libidn support.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Invalid Free:** The core issue is an incorrect memory management within `getaddrinfo()`. When handling internationalized domain names (IDNs) with the `AI_IDN` flag, the function may attempt to free memory that was not properly allocated.
*   The `gaih_inet` function in `sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c` was not updating the `name` pointer when the IDN string was converted to ASCII, leading to a double free.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker able to make an application call the vulnerable `getaddrinfo()` function could potentially execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application. This is because an invalid free can corrupt memory structures leading to hijacking of control flow.
*   **Application Crash:**  The vulnerability can also lead to application crashes as a result of memory corruption. As seen in Bug 981942, `ping6` crashes when provided with an internationalized domain name.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not explicitly mentioned as the primary impact, the possibility of a denial-of-service condition is also mentioned, as demonstrated by the `ping6` crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, if they can cause the target application to call the vulnerable function
*   **Network:** The attack vector involves the application calling `getaddrinfo()` on a potentially attacker-controlled name using the `AI_IDN` flag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to trigger `getaddrinfo()`:** The attacker must be able to influence an application to call the `getaddrinfo()` function with the `AI_IDN` flag and a specifically crafted input.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable applications:** The attacker needs to know which applications on the target system are using glibc with libidn support and calling the vulnerable function with untrusted input.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in glibc version 2.15 with commit `2e96f1c73b06e81da59ef7fffa426dc201875f31`.
*   Red Hat backported the fix to older versions of glibc in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (RHSA-2015:1627) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHSA-2014:1391).
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "Moderate" severity.
