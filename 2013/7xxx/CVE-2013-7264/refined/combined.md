## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of

ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](/security/CVE-2013-2929))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel's ansi cprng random

number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break

cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](/security/CVE-2013-4345))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux

kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](/security/CVE-2013-4348))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the Linux Kernel's kvm\_vm\_ioctl\_create\_vcpu

function of the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem. A local user could

exploit this flaw to gain privileges on the host machine. ([CVE-2013-4587](/security/CVE-2013-4587))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the apic\_get\_tmcct function of the Kernel

Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem if the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or host OS system crash.

([CVE-2013-6367](/security/CVE-2013-6367))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this

flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact.

([CVE-2013-6380](/security/CVE-2013-6380))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the

implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](/security/CVE-2013-6382))

mpd reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

system calls in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7263](/security/CVE-2013-7263))

mpb reported an information leak in the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (l2tp)

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7264](/security/CVE-2013-7264))

mpb reported an information leak in the Phone Network protocol (phonet) in

the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7265](/security/CVE-2013-7265))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from

kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7266](/security/CVE-2013-7266))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local

user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information

from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](/security/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](/security/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](/security/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux

kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially

sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](/security/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A

local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](/security/CVE-2013-7271))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area

Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7281](/security/CVE-2013-7281))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1443-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1443.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1443.62)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 3 kernel was
updated to fix various bugs and security issues.
------------------------------------------------------------
------------ WARNING: If you are running KVM with PCI
pass-through on a system with one of the following Intel
chipsets: 5500 (revision 0x13), 5520 (revision 0x13) or
X58 (revisions 0x12, 0x13, 0x22), please make sure to read
the following support document before installing this
update:
<https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7014344>
<[https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7014344>](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7014344%3E) . You
will have to update your KVM setup to no longer make use
of PCI pass-through before rebooting to the updated
kernel.
------------------------------------------------------------
------------
The following security bugs were fixed:
\*
CVE-2013-4470: The Linux kernel before 3.12, when UDP
Fragmentation Offload (UFO) is enabled, does not properly
initialize certain data structures, which allows local
users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted
application that uses the UDP\_CORK option in a setsockopt
system call and sends both short and long packets, related
to the ip\_ufo\_append\_data function in net/ipv4/ip\_output.c
and the ip6\_ufo\_append\_data function in
net/ipv6/ip6\_output.c. (bnc#847672)
\*
CVE-2013-6885: The microcode on AMD 16h 00h through
0Fh processors does not properly handle the interaction
between locked instructions and write-combined memory
types, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (system hang) via a crafted application, aka the
errata 793 issue. (bnc#852967)
\*
CVE-2013-7263: The Linux kernel before 3.12.4 updates
certain length values before ensuring that associated data
structures have been initialized, which allows local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory
via a (1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or (3) recvmsg system
call, related to net/ipv4/ping.c, net/ipv4/raw.c,
net/ipv4/udp.c, net/ipv6/raw.c, and net/ipv6/udp.c.
(bnc#857643)
\*
CVE-2013-7264: The l2tp\_ip\_recvmsg function in
net/l2tp/l2tp\_ip.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12.4
updates a certain length value before ensuring that an
associated data structure has been initialized, which
allows local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel stack memory via a (1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or
(3) recvmsg system call. (bnc#857643)
\*
CVE-2013-7265: The pn\_recvmsg function in
net/phonet/datagram.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12.4
updates a certain length value before ensuring that an
associated data structure has been initialized, which
allows local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel stack memory via a (1) recvfrom, (2) recvmmsg, or
(3) recvmsg system call. (bnc#857643)
\*
CVE-2014-0069: The cifs\_iovec\_write function in
fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not
properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer
than the requested number of bytes, which allows local
users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory,
cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system
crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system
call with a crafted pointer. (bnc#864025)
The following non-security bugs were fixed:
\* kabi: protect symbols modified by bnc#864833 fix
(bnc#864833).
\* mm: mempolicy: fix mbind\_range() && vma\_adjust()
interaction (VM Functionality (bnc#866428)).
\* mm: merging memory blocks resets mempolicy (VM
Functionality (bnc#866428)).
\* mm/page-writeback.c: do not count anon pages as
dirtyable memory (High memory utilisation performance
(bnc#859225)).
\* mm: vmscan: Do not force reclaim file pages until it
exceeds anon (High memory utilisation performance
(bnc#859225)).
\* mm: vmscan: fix endless loop in kswapd balancing
(High memory utilisation performance (bnc#859225)).
\* mm: vmscan: Update rotated and scanned when force
reclaimed (High memory utilisation performance
(bnc#859225)).
\* mm: exclude memory less nodes from zone\_reclaim
(bnc#863526).
\* mm: fix return type for functions nr\_free\_\*\_pages
kabi fixup (bnc#864058).
\* mm: fix return type for functions nr\_free\_\*\_pages
(bnc#864058).
\* mm: swap: Use swapfiles in priority order (Use swap
files in priority order (bnc#862957)).
\* x86: Save cr2 in NMI in case NMIs take a page fault
(follow-up for
patches.fixes/x86-Add-workaround-to-NMI-iret-woes.patch).
\* powerpc: Add VDSO version of getcpu (fate#316816,
bnc#854445).
\* vmscan: change type of vm\_total\_pages to unsigned
long (bnc#864058).

# USN-2108-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

18 February 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

mpd reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

system calls in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7263](/security/CVE-2013-7263))

mpb reported an information leak in the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (l2tp)

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7264](/security/CVE-2013-7264))

mpb reported an information leak in the Phone Network protocol (phonet) in

the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7265](/security/CVE-2013-7265))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area

Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7281](/security/CVE-2013-7281))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-361-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-361.74](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-361.74)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.8.0-37-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring)
  -
  [3.8.0-37.53~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-37.53~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's compat ioctls for Adaptec

AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send

administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data

stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](/security/CVE-2013-6383))

mpd reported an information leak in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg

system calls in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit

this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

([CVE-2013-7263](/security/CVE-2013-7263))

mpb reported an information leak in the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (l2tp)

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7264](/security/CVE-2013-7264))

mpb reported an information leak in the Phone Network protocol (phonet) in

the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7265](/security/CVE-2013-7265))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area

Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could

exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-17.31~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-17.31~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

```

   Hello,

```
Recently Mitre split up a cve 'CVE-2013-6405' into 3 separate CVEs. Each for
subset of files touched by a commit 'bceaa90240'.
```

 -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/bceaa90240b6019ed73b49965eac7d167610be69>

But the 3 new CVEs do not seem to cover patch to a file

  -> net/ieee802154/dgram.c.

Is that intentional or a miss. (just checking)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.10

* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)
* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.5.0-47.71)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-17.31)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-17-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-17.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-17.31)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

  -
  [3.2.0-59.90](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-59.90)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-47-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-47.71~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-47.71~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

drm/radeon/audio: correct ACR table
commit 3e71985f2439d8c4090dc2820e497e6f3d72dcff upstream.
The values were taken from the HDMI spec, but they assumed
exact x/1.001 clocks. Since we round the clocks, we also need
to calculate different N and CTS values.
Note that the N for 25.2/1.001 MHz at 44.1 kHz audio is out of
spec. Hopefully this mode is rarely used and/or HDMI sinks
tolerate overly large values of N.

drm/radeon/audio: improve ACR calculation
commit a2098250fbda149cfad9e626afe80abe3b21e574 upstream.
In order to have any realistic chance of calculating proper
ACR values, we need to be able to calculate both N and CTS,
not just CTS. We still aim for the ideal N as specified in
the HDMI spec though.

aio: prevent double free in ioctx\_alloc
commit d558023207e008a4476a3b7bb8706b2a2bf5d84f upstream.
ioctx\_alloc() calls aio\_setup\_ring() to allocate a ring. If aio\_setup\_ring()
fails to do so it would call aio\_free\_ring() before returning, but
ioctx\_alloc() would call aio\_free\_ring() again causing a double free of
the ring.
This is easily reproducible from userspace.

aio: Fix a trinity splat
commit e34ecee2ae791df674dfb466ce40692ca6218e43 upstream.
aio kiocb refcounting was broken - it was relying on keeping track of
the number of available ring buffer entries, which it needs to do
anyways; then at shutdown time it'd wait for completions to be delivered
until the # of available ring buffer entries equalled what it was
initialized to.
Problem with that is that the ring buffer is mapped writable into
userspace, so userspace could futz with the head and tail pointers to
cause the kernel to see extra completions, and cause free\_ioctx() to
return while there were still outstanding kiocbs. Which would be bad.
Fix is just to directly refcount the kiocbs - which is more
straightforward, and with the new percpu refcounting code doesn't cost
us any cacheline bouncing which was the whole point of the original
scheme.
Also clean up ioctx\_alloc()'s error path and fix a bug where it wasn't
subtracting from aio\_nr if ioctx\_add\_table() failed.

ntp: Make periodic RTC update more reliable
commit a97ad0c4b447a132a322cedc3a5f7fa4cab4b304 upstream.
The current code requires that the scheduled update of the RTC happens
in the closest tick to the half of the second. This seems to be
difficult to achieve reliably. The scheduled work may be missing the
target time by a tick or two and be constantly rescheduled every second.
Relax the limit to 10 ticks. As a typical RTC drifts in the 11-minute
update interval by several milliseconds, this shouldn't affect the
overall accuracy of the RTC much.

(\*) When del\_timer\_sync() is called, lock\_timer\_base() will loop infinitely
while timer->base == NULL. In this case, as timer will never initialized,
it results in lockup.
This patch introduces acquisition of q->sysfs\_lock around elevator\_init()

iommu: Remove stack trace from broken irq remapping warning
commit 05104a4e8713b27291c7bb49c1e7e68b4e243571 upstream.
The warning for the irq remapping broken check in intel\_irq\_remapping.c is
pretty pointless. We need the warning, but we know where its comming from, the
stack trace will always be the same, and it needlessly triggers things like
Abrt. This changes the warning to just print a text warning about BIOS being
broken, without the stack trace, then sets the appropriate taint bit. Since we
automatically disable irq remapping, theres no need to contiue making Abrt jump
at this problem

iommu/vt-d: Fixed interaction of VFIO\_IOMMU\_MAP\_DMA with IOMMU address limits
commit f9423606ade08653dd8a43334f0a7fb45504c5cc upstream.
The BUG\_ON in drivers/iommu/intel-iommu.c:785 can be triggered from userspace via
VFIO by calling the VFIO\_IOMMU\_MAP\_DMA ioctl on a vfio device with any address
beyond the addressing capabilities of the IOMMU. The problem is that the ioctl code
calls iommu\_iova\_to\_phys before it calls iommu\_map. iommu\_map handles the case that
it gets addresses beyond the addressing capabilities of its IOMMU.
intel\_iommu\_iova\_to\_phys does not.
This patch fixes iommu\_iova\_to\_phys to return NULL for addresses beyond what the
IOMMU can handle. This in turn causes the ioctl call to fail in iommu\_map and
(correctly) return EFAULT to the user with a helpful warning message in the kernel
log.

work around because the work around crashes them. They cannot be

usb: musb: davinci: fix resources passed to MUSB driver for DM6467
commit ea78201e2e08f8a91e30100c4c4a908b5cf295fc upstream.
After commit 09fc7d22b024692b2fe8a943b246de1af307132b (usb: musb: fix incorrect
usage of resource pointer), CPPI DMA driver on DaVinci DM6467 can't detect its
dedicated IRQ and so the MUSB IRQ is erroneously used instead. This is because
only 2 resources are passed to the MUSB driver from the DaVinci glue layer, so
fix this by always copying 3 resources (it's safe since a placeholder for the
3rd resource is always there) and passing 'pdev->num\_resources' instead of the
size of musb\_resources[] to platform\_device\_add\_resources().

This is because raid5d() can be running when the multi-thread
resources are changed via system. We see need to provide locking.
mddev->device\_lock is suitable, but we cannot simple call
alloc\_thread\_groups under this lock as we cannot allocate memory
while holding a spinlock.
So change alloc\_thread\_groups() to allocate and return the data
structures, then raid5\_store\_group\_thread\_cnt() can take the lock
while updating the pointers to the data structures.
This fixes a bug introduced in 3.12 and so is suitable for the 3.12.x
stable series.

mm: numa: return the number of base pages altered by protection changes
commit 72403b4a0fbdf433c1fe0127e49864658f6f6468 upstream.
Commit 0255d4918480 ("mm: Account for a THP NUMA hinting update as one
PTE update") was added to account for the number of PTE updates when
marking pages prot\_numa. task\_numa\_work was using the old return value
to track how much address space had been updated. Altering the return
value causes the scanner to do more work than it is configured or
documented to in a single unit of work.
This patch reverts that commit and accounts for the number of THP
updates separately in vmstat. It is up to the administrator to
interpret the pair of values correctly. This is a straight-forward
operation and likely to only be of interest when actively debugging NUMA
balancing problems.
The impact of this patch is that the NUMA PTE scanner will scan slower
when THP is enabled and workloads may converge slower as a result. On
the flip size system CPU usage should be lower than recent tests
reported. This is an illustrative example of a short single JVM specjbb
test

commit 8c567a7fab6e086a0284eee2db82348521e7120c upstream.
Check for CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN since the caller can truncate preallocated
blocks from files they do not own nor have write access to. A more
fine grained access check was considered: require the caller to
specify their own uid/gid and to use inode\_permission to check for
write, but this would not catch the case of an inode not reachable
via path traversal from the callers mount namespace.

tried to support IPsec ESP transport transformation for pktgen, but acctually
this doesn't work at all for two reasons(The orignal transformed packet has
bad IPv4 checksum value, as well as wrong auth value, reported by wireshark)
- After transpormation, IPv4 header total length needs update,
because encrypted payload's length is NOT same as that of plain text.
- After transformation, IPv4 checksum needs re-caculate because of payload
has been changed.
With this patch, armmed pktgen with below cofiguration, Wireshark is able to
decrypted ESP packet generated by pktgen without any IPv4 checksum error or
auth value error.

Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
This is because the macro operations in smc91x.h defined
for Versatile are missing SMC\_outsw() as used in this
commit.
The Versatile needs and uses the same accessors as the other
platforms in the first if(...) clause, just switch it to using
that and we have one problem less to worry about.
This includes a hunk of a patch from Will Deacon fixin
the other 32bit platforms as well: Innokom, Ramses, PXA,
PCM027.
Checkpatch complains about spacing, but I have opted to
follow the style of this .h-file.

When a skb has frags, bytes\_compl plus skb->len nr\_frags times in cp\_tx().
It's not the correct value(actually, it should plus skb->len once) and it
will trigger the BUG\_ON(bytes\_compl > num\_queued - dql->num\_completed).
So only increase bytes\_compl when finish sending all frags. pkts\_compl also
has a wrong value, fix it too.
It's introduced by commit 871f0d4c ("8139cp: enable bql").

r8169: check ALDPS bit and disable it if enabled for the 8168g
[ Upstream commit 1bac1072425c86f1ac85bd5967910706677ef8b3 ]
Windows driver will enable ALDPS function, but linux driver and firmware
do not have any configuration related to ALDPS function for 8168g.
So restart system to linux and remove the NIC cable, LAN enter ALDPS,
then LAN RX will be disabled.
This issue can be easily reproduced on dual boot windows and linux
system with RTL\_GIGA\_MAC\_VER\_40 chip.
Realtek said, ALDPS function can be disabled by configuring to PHY,
switch to page 0x0A43, reg0x10 bit2=0.

via-velocity: fix netif\_receive\_skb use in irq disabled section.
[ Upstream commit bc9627e7e918a85e906c1a3f6d01d9b8ef911a96 ]
2fdac010bdcf10a30711b6924612dfc40daf19b8 ("via-velocity.c: update napi
implementation") overlooked an irq disabling spinlock when the Rx part
of the NAPI poll handler was converted from netif\_rx to netif\_receive\_skb.
NAPI Rx processing can be taken out of the locked section with a pair of
napi\_{disable / enable} since it only races with the MTU change function.
An heavier rework of the NAPI locking would be able to perform NAPI Tx
before Rx where I simply removed one of velocity\_tx\_srv calls.

sch\_tbf: handle too small burst
[ Upstream commit 4d0820cf6a55d72350cb2d24a4504f62fbde95d9 ]
If a too small burst is inadvertently set on TBF, we might trigger
a bug in tbf\_segment(), as 'skb' instead of 'segs' was used in a
qdisc\_reshape\_fail() call.
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: tbf latency 50ms burst 1KB rate
50mbit
Fix the bug, and add a warning, as such configuration is not
going to work anyway for non GSO packets.
(For some reason, one has to use a burst >= 1520 to get a working
configuration, even with old kernels. This is a probable iproute2/tc
bug)

This patch simplifies the checksum verification in tcpX\_gro\_receive

does for CHECKSUM\_NONE is compute the partial checksum and then
treat it as if it came from the hardware (CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE).

gro: Only verify TCP checksums for candidates
[ Upstream commit cc5c00bbb44c5d68b883aa5cb9d01514a2525d94 ]
In some cases we may receive IP packets that are longer than
their stated lengths. Such packets are never merged in GRO.
However, we may end up computing their checksums incorrectly
and end up allowing packets with a bogus checksum enter our
stack with the checksum status set as verified.
Since such packets are rare and not performance-critical, this
patch simply skips the checksum verification for them.

gso: handle new frag\_list of frags GRO packets
[ Upstream commit 9d8506cc2d7ea1f911c72c100193a3677f6668c3 ]
Recently GRO started generating packets with frag\_lists of frags.
This was not handled by GSO, thus leading to a crash.
Thankfully these packets are of a regular form and are easy to
handle. This patch handles them in two ways. For completely
non-linear frag\_list entries, we simply continue to iterate over
the frag\_list frags once we exhaust the normal frags. For frag\_list
entries with linear parts, we call pskb\_trim on the first part
of the frag\_list skb, and then process the rest of the frags in
the usual way.
This patch also kills a chunk of dead frag\_list code that has
obviously never ever been run since it ends up generating a bogus
GSO-segmented packet with a frag\_list entry.
Future work is planned to split super big packets into TSO
ones.

Currently we're using plain spin\_lock() in prb\_shutdown\_retire\_blk\_timer(),
however the timer might fire right in the middle and thus try to re-aquire
the same spinlock, leaving us in a endless loop.
To fix that, use the spin\_lock\_bh() to block it.

packet: fix use after free race in send path when dev is released
[ Upstream commit e40526cb20b5ee53419452e1f03d97092f144418 ]
Salam reported a use after free bug in PF\_PACKET that occurs when
we're sending out frames on a socket bound device and suddenly the
net device is being unregistered. It appears that commit 827d9780
introduced a possible race condition between {t,}packet\_snd() and
packet\_notifier(). In the case of a bound socket, packet\_notifier()
can drop the last reference to the net\_device and {t,}packet\_snd()
might end up suddenly sending a packet over a freed net\_device.
To avoid reverting 827d9780 and thus introducing a performance
regression compared to the current state of things, we decided to
hold a cached RCU protected pointer to the net device and maintain
it on write side via bind spin\_lock protected register\_prot\_hook()
and \_\_unregister\_prot\_hook() calls.
In {t,}packet\_snd() path, we access this pointer under rcu\_read\_lock
through packet\_cached\_dev\_get() that holds reference to the device
to prevent it from being freed through packet\_notifier() while
we're in send path. This is okay to do as dev\_put()/dev\_hold() are
per-cpu counters, so this should not be a performance issue. Also,
the code simplifies a bit as we don't need need\_rls\_dev anymore.

the bridge was removed, the address entry in the fdb did not free,
the bridge\_fdb\_cache still has objects when destroy the cache, Fix
this by flushing the bridge address entry when removing the bridge.
v2: according to the Toshiaki Makita and Vlad's suggestion, I only
delete the vlan0 entry, it still have a leak here if the vlan id
is other number, so I need to call fdb\_delete\_by\_port(br, NULL, 1)
to flush all entries whose dst is NULL for the bridge.

net: core: Always propagate flag changes to interfaces
[ Upstream commit d2615bf450694c1302d86b9cc8a8958edfe4c3a4 ]
The following commit:
b6c40d68ff6498b7f63ddf97cf0aa818d748dee7
net: only invoke dev->change\_rx\_flags when device is UP
tried to fix a problem with VLAN devices and promiscuouse flag setting.
The issue was that VLAN device was setting a flag on an interface that
was down, thus resulting in bad promiscuity count.
This commit blocked flag propagation to any device that is currently
down.
A later commit:
deede2fabe24e00bd7e246eb81cd5767dc6fcfc7
vlan: Don't propagate flag changes on down interfaces
fixed VLAN code to only propagate flags when the VLAN interface is up,
thus fixing the same issue as above, only localized to VLAN.
The problem we have now is that if we have create a complex stack
involving multiple software devices like bridges, bonds, and vlans,
then it is possible that the flags would not propagate properly to
the physical devices. A simple examle of the scenario is the
following:
eth0----> bond0 ----> bridge0 ---> vlan50
If bond0 or eth0 happen to be down at the time bond0 is added to
the bridge, then eth0 will never have promisc mode set which is
currently required for operation as part of the bridge. As a
result, packets with vlan50 will be dropped by the interface.
The only 2 devices that implement the special flag handling are
VLAN and DSA and they both have required code to prevent incorrect
flag propagation. As a result we can remove the generic solution
introduced in b6c40d68ff6498b7f63ddf97cf0aa818d748dee7 and leave
it to the individual devices to decide whether they will block
flag propagation or not.

ipv4: fix race in concurrent ip\_route\_input\_slow()
[ Upstream commit dcdfdf56b4a6c9437fc37dbc9cee94a788f9b0c4 ]
CPUs can ask for local route via ip\_route\_input\_noref() concurrently.
if nh\_rth\_input is not cached yet, CPUs will proceed to allocate
equivalent DSTs on 'lo' and then will try to cache them in nh\_rth\_input
via rt\_cache\_route()
Most of the time they succeed, but on occasion the following two lines:
orig = \*p;
prev = cmpxchg(p, orig, rt);
in rt\_cache\_route() do race and one of the cpus fails to complete cmpxchg.
But ip\_route\_input\_slow() doesn't check the return code of rt\_cache\_route(),
so dst is leaking. dst\_destroy() is never called and 'lo' device
refcnt doesn't go to zero, which can be seen in the logs as:
unregister\_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 1
Adding mdelay() between above two lines makes it easily reproducible.
Fix it similar to nh\_pcpu\_rth\_output case.

tcp: don't update snd\_nxt, when a socket is switched from repair mode
[ Upstream commit dbde497966804e63a38fdedc1e3815e77097efc2 ]
snd\_nxt must be updated synchronously with sk\_send\_head. Otherwise
tp->packets\_out may be updated incorrectly, what may bring a kernel panic.
Here is a kernel panic from my host.
[ 103.043194] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000048
[ 103.044025] IP: [] tcp\_rearm\_rto+0xcf/0x150
...
[ 146.301158] Call Trace:
[ 146.301158] [] tcp\_ack+0xcc0/0x12c0
Before this panic a tcp socket was restored. This socket had sent and
unsent data in the write queue. Sent data was restored in repair mode,
then the socket was switched from reapair mode and unsent data was
restored. After that the socket was switched back into repair mode.
In that moment we had a socket where write queue looks like this:
snd\_una snd\_nxt write\_seq
|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|
|
sk\_send\_head
After a second switching from repair mode the state of socket was
changed:
snd\_una snd\_nxt, write\_seq
|\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_|
|
sk\_send\_head
This state is inconsistent, because snd\_nxt and sk\_send\_head are not
synchronized.
Bellow you can find a call trace, how packets\_out can be incremented
twice for one skb, if snd\_nxt and sk\_send\_head are not synchronized.
In this case packets\_out will be always positive, even when
sk\_write\_queue is empty.
tcp\_write\_wakeup
skb = tcp\_send\_head(sk);
tcp\_fragment
if (!before(tp->snd\_nxt, TCP\_SKB\_CB(buff)->end\_seq))
tcp\_adjust\_pcount(sk, skb, diff);
tcp\_event\_new\_data\_sent
tp->packets\_out += tcp\_skb\_pcount(skb);
I think update of snd\_nxt isn't required, when a socket is switched from
repair mode. Because it's initialized in tcp\_connect\_init. Then when a
write queue is restored, snd\_nxt is incremented in tcp\_event\_new\_data\_sent,
so it's always is in consistent state.
I have checked, that the bug is not reproduced with this patch and
all tests about restoring tcp connections work fine.

netfilter: push reasm skb through instead of original frag skbs
[ Upstream commit 6aafeef03b9d9ecf255f3a80ed85ee070260e1ae ]
Pushing original fragments through causes several problems. For example
for matching, frags may not be matched correctly. Take following
example:
On HOSTA do:
ip6tables -I INPUT -p icmpv6 -j DROP
ip6tables -I INPUT -p icmpv6 -m icmp6 --icmpv6-type 128 -j ACCEPT
and on HOSTB you do:
ping6 HOSTA -s2000 (MTU is 1500)
Incoming echo requests will be filtered out on HOSTA. This issue does
not occur with smaller packets than MTU (where fragmentation does not happen)

As was discussed previously, the only correct solution seems to be to use
reassembled skb instead of separete frags. Doing this has positive side
effects in reducing sk\_buff by one pointer (nfct\_reasm) and also the reams
dances in ipvs and conntrack can be removed.
Future plan is to remove net/ipv6/netfilter/nf\_conntrack\_reasm.c
entirely and use code in net/ipv6/reassembly.c instead.

net: rework recvmsg handler msg\_name and msg\_namelen logic
[ Upstream commit f3d3342602f8bcbf37d7c46641cb9bca7618eb1c ]
This patch now always passes msg->msg\_namelen as 0. recvmsg handlers must
set msg\_namelen to the proper size <= sizeof(struct sockaddr\_storage)
to return msg\_name to the user.
This prevents numerous uninitialized memory leaks we had in the
recvmsg handlers and makes it harder for new code to accidentally leak
uninitialized memory.
Optimize for the case recvfrom is called with NULL as address. We don't
need to copy the address at all, so set it to NULL before invoking the
recvmsg handler. We can do so, because all the recvmsg handlers must
cope with the case a plain read() is called on them. read() also sets
msg\_name to NULL.
Also document these changes in include/linux/net.h as suggested by David
Miller.
Changes since RFC:
Set msg->msg\_name = NULL if user specified a NULL in msg\_name but had a
non-null msg\_namelen in verify\_iovec/verify\_compat\_iovec. This doesn't
affect sendto as it would bail out earlier while trying to copy-in the
address. It also more naturally reflects the logic by the callers of
verify\_iovec.
With this change in place I could remove "
if (!uaddr || msg\_sys->msg\_namelen == 0)
msg->msg\_name = NULL
".
This change does not alter the user visible error logic as we ignore
msg\_namelen as long as msg\_name is NULL.
Also remove two unnecessary curly brackets in \_\_\_sys\_recvmsg and change
comments to netdev style.

pkt\_sched: fq: fix pacing for small frames
[ Upstream commit f52ed89971adbe79b6438c459814034707b8ab91 ]
For performance reasons, sch\_fq tried hard to not setup timers for every
sent packet, using a quantum based heuristic : A delay is setup only if
the flow exhausted its credit.
Problem is that application limited flows can refill their credit
for every queued packet, and they can evade pacing.
This problem can also be triggered when TCP flows use small MSS values,
as TSO auto sizing builds packets that are smaller than the default fq
quantum (3028 bytes)
This patch adds a 40 ms delay to guard flow credit refill.

connector: improved unaligned access error fix
[ Upstream commit 1ca1a4cf59ea343a1a70084fe7cc96f37f3cf5b1 ]
In af3e095a1fb4, Erik Jacobsen fixed one type of unaligned access
bug for ia64 by converting a 64-bit write to use put\_unaligned().
Unfortunately, since gcc will convert a short memset() to a series
of appropriately-aligned stores, the problem is now visible again
on tilegx, where the memset that zeros out proc\_event is converted
to three 64-bit stores, causing an unaligned access panic.
A better fix for the original problem is to ensure that proc\_event
is aligned to 8 bytes here. We can do that relatively easily by
arranging to start the struct cn\_msg aligned to 8 bytes and then
offset by 4 bytes. Doing so means that the immediately following
proc\_event structure is then correctly aligned to 8 bytes.
The result is that the memset() stores are now aligned, and as an
added benefit, we can remove the put\_unaligned() calls in the code.

pkt\_sched: fq: change classification of control packets
[ Upstream commit 2abc2f070eb30ac8421554a5c32229f8332c6206 ]
Initial sch\_fq implementation copied code from pfifo\_fast to classify
a packet as a high prio packet.
This clashes with setups using PRIO with say 7 bands, as one of the
band could be incorrectly (mis)classified by FQ.
Packets would be queued in the 'internal' queue, and no pacing ever
happen for this special queue.

ip6tnl: fix use after free of fb\_tnl\_dev
[ Upstream commit 1e9f3d6f1c403dd2b6270f654b4747147aa2306f ]
Bug has been introduced by commit bb8140947a24 ("ip6tnl: allow to use rtnl ops
on fb tunnel").
When ip6\_tunnel.ko is unloaded, FB device is delete by rtnl\_link\_unregister()
and then we try to use the pointer in ip6\_tnl\_destroy\_tunnels().
Let's add an handler for dellink, which will never remove the FB tunnel. With
this patch it will no more be possible to remove it via 'ip link del ip6tnl0',
but it's safer.
The same fix was already proposed by Willem de Bruijn  for
sit interfaces.

sit: fix use after free of fb\_tunnel\_dev
[ Upstream commit 9434266f2c645d4fcf62a03a8e36ad8075e37943 ]
Bug: The fallback device is created in sit\_init\_net and assumed to be
freed in sit\_exit\_net. First, it is dereferenced in that function, in
sit\_destroy\_tunnels:
struct net \*net = dev\_net(sitn->fb\_tunnel\_dev);
Prior to this, rtnl\_unlink\_register has removed all devices that match
rtnl\_link\_ops == sit\_link\_ops.
Commit 205983c43700 added the line
+ sitn->fb\_tunnel\_dev->rtnl\_link\_ops = &sit\_link\_ops;
which cases the fallback device to match here and be freed before it
is last dereferenced.
Fix: This commit adds an explicit .delllink callback to sit\_link\_ops
that skips deallocation at rtnl\_unlink\_register for the fallback
device. This mechanism is comparable to the one in ip\_tunnel.
It also modifies sit\_destroy\_tunnels and its only caller sit\_exit\_net
to avoid the offending dereference in the first place. That double
lookup is more complicated than required.
Test: The bug is only triggered when CONFIG\_NET\_NS is enabled. It
causes a GPF only when CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SLAB is enabled. Verified that
this bug exists at the mentioned commit, at davem-net HEAD and at
3.11.y HEAD. Verified that it went away after applying this patch.

tcp: tsq: restore minimal amount of queueing
[ Upstream commit 98e09386c0ef4dfd48af7ba60ff908f0d525cdee ]
After commit c9eeec26e32e ("tcp: TSQ can use a dynamic limit"), several
users reported throughput regressions, notably on mvneta and wifi
adapters.
802.11 AMPDU requires a fair amount of queueing to be effective.
This patch partially reverts the change done in tcp\_write\_xmit()
so that the minimal amount is sysctl\_tcp\_limit\_output\_bytes.
It also remove the use of this sysctl while building skb stored
in write queue, as TSO autosizing does the right thing anyway.
Users with well behaving NICS and correct qdisc (like sch\_fq),
can then lower the default sysctl\_tcp\_limit\_output\_bytes value from
128KB to 8KB.
This new usage of sysctl\_tcp\_limit\_output\_bytes permits each driver
authors to check how their driver performs when/if the value is set
to a minimum of 4KB.
Normally, line rate for a single TCP flow should be possible,
but some drivers rely on timers to perform TX completion and
too long TX completion delays prevent reaching full throughput.

macvtap: limit head length of skb allocated

effect of zerocopy or even disable if a gso skb is linearized in guest.

6lowpan: Uncompression of traffic class field was incorrect
[ Upstream commit 1188f05497e7bd2f2614b99c54adfbe7413d5749 ]
If priority/traffic class field in IPv6 header is set (seen when
using ssh), the uncompression sets the TC and Flow fields incorrectly.
Example:
This is IPv6 header of a sent packet. Note the priority/TC (=1) in
the first byte.
00000000: 61 00 00 00 00 2c 06 40 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000010: 02 02 72 ff fe c6 42 10 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000020: 02 1e ab ff fe 4c 52 57
This gets compressed like this in the sending side
00000000: 72 31 04 06 02 1e ab ff fe 4c 52 57 ec c2 00 16
00000010: aa 2d fe 92 86 4e be c6 ....
In the receiving end, the packet gets uncompressed to this
IPv6 header
00000000: 60 06 06 02 00 2a 1e 40 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000010: 02 02 72 ff fe c6 42 10 fe 80 00 00 00 00 00 00
00000020: ab ff fe 4c 52 57 ec c2
First four bytes are set incorrectly and we have also lost
two bytes from destination address.
The fix is to switch the case values in switch statement
when checking the TC field.

random32: fix off-by-one in seeding requirement
[ Upstream commit 51c37a70aaa3f95773af560e6db3073520513912 ]
For properly initialising the Tausworthe generator [1], we have
a strict seeding requirement, that is, s1 > 1, s2 > 7, s3 > 15.
Commit 697f8d0348 ("random32: seeding improvement") introduced
a \_\_seed() function that imposes boundary checks proposed by the
errata paper [2] to properly ensure above conditions.
However, we're off by one, as the function is implemented as:
"return (x < m) ? x + m : x;", and called with \_\_seed(X, 1),
\_\_seed(X, 7), \_\_seed(X, 15). Thus, an unwanted seed of 1, 7, 15
would be possible, whereas the lower boundary should actually
be of at least 2, 8, 16, just as GSL does. Fix this, as otherwise
an initialization with an unwanted seed could have the effect
that Tausworthe's PRNG properties cannot not be ensured.
Note that this PRNG is \*not\* used for cryptography in the kernel.

NULL, that means that overriding will not happen, because those default
routers were added without flag RTF\_ROUTEINFO in rt6\_add\_dflt\_router().

When trying to delete a table >= 256 using iproute2 the local table
will be deleted.
The table id is specified as a netlink attribute when it needs more then
8 bits and iproute2 then sets the table field to RT\_TABLE\_UNSPEC (0).
Preconditions to matching the table id in the rule delete code
doesn't seem to take the "table id in netlink attribute" into condition
so the frh\_get\_table helper function never gets to do its job when
matching against current rule.
Use the helper function twice instead of peaking at the table value directly.

there is enough space to include a fragment header in the skb from a
skb->mac\_header dervived one to skb\_headroom. Because we already peeled
off the skb to transport\_header this is wrong. Change this back to check
if we have enough room before the mac\_header.
This fixes a panic Saran Neti reported. He used the tbf scheduler which
skb\_gso\_segments the skb. The offsets get negative and we panic in memcpy
because the skb was erroneously not expanded at the head.

net: mv643xx\_eth: Add missing phy\_addr\_set in DT mode
Commit cc9d4598 'net: mv643xx\_eth: use of\_phy\_connect if phy\_node
present' made the call to phy\_scan optional, if the DT has a link to
the phy node.
However phy\_scan has the side effect of calling phy\_addr\_set, which
writes the phy MDIO address to the ethernet controller. If phy\_addr\_set
is not called, and the bootloader has not set the correct address then
the driver will fail to function.
Tested on Kirkwood.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1035875#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2013-11-28 17:35:49 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the networking support(CONFIG_NET), is vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw. It occurs while doing the recvmsg(2), recvfrom(2), recvmmsg(2) socket calls.  A user/program could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.  Upstream fix: -------------  -> <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/?id=bceaa90240b6019ed73b49965eac7d167610be69>   -> <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/?id=85fbaa75037d0b6b786ff18658ddf0b4014ce2a4>   Original 'CVE-2013-6405' assigned to this issue has been rejected and the following 4 have been assigned for the same:     - [CVE-2013-7263](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7263) (net/ipv4/ping.c, net/ipv4/raw.c, net/ipv4/udp.c,                     net/ipv6/raw.c, and net/ipv6/udp.c),    - [CVE-2013-7264](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7264) (net/l2tp/l2tp_ip.c),    - [CVE-2013-7265](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7265) (net/phonet/datagram.c)    - [CVE-2013-7281](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7281) (net/ieee802154/dgram.c)  === Name: [CVE-2013-6405](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-6405)  ** REJECT **  DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.

inet: prevent leakage of uninitialized memory to user in recv syscalls

```
Only update *addr_len when we actually fill in sockaddr, otherwise we
can return uninitialized memory from the stack to the caller in the
recvfrom, recvmmsg and recvmsg syscalls. Drop the the (addr_len == NULL)
checks because we only get called with a valid addr_len pointer either
from sock_common_recvmsg or inet_recvmsg.

If a blocking read waits on a socket which is concurrently shut down we
now return zero and set msg_msgnamelen to 0.
