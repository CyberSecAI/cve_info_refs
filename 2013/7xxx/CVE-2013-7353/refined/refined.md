```
CVE-2013-7353:

- Root cause of vulnerability: Integer overflow in the png_set_unknown_chunks function in libpng/pngset.c.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution due to the heap-based buffer overflow if a vulnerable application uses the libpng API with crafted input.
- Attack vectors: By providing a specially crafted PNG file to an application that uses the vulnerable libpng library.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted PNG file to an application that uses the vulnerable libpng API.
