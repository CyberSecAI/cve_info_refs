The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in MobileIron products, specifically referencing CVE-2014-1409, CVE-2013-7286 and CVE-2013-7287. This response focuses on CVE-2013-7287 as requested.

**CVE-2013-7287:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The advisory mentions "a second insecure encryption scheme" described in a document ([1] which is a link to a PDF file about MDM security). This insecure scheme was assigned CVE-2013-7287. However, the document does not provide specific details about the algorithm used or weaknesses except that it is an encryption scheme which is considered insecure.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure encryption algorithm used for storing credentials.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to decrypt stored credentials (passwords), and potentially gain access to the device, any attached devices and/or the Active Directory domain it is linked to.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker who is able to extract the encrypted credentials can decrypt the credentials using the insecure encryption algorithm.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to obtain the encrypted credentials which are available in the configuration file extracted via the blind XPath Injection vulnerability (CVE-2014-1409) to exploit this.
