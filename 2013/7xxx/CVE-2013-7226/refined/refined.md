Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-7226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `gdImageCrop` function within the `ext/gd/gd.c` file in PHP versions 5.5.x before 5.5.9. This overflow occurs when a large `x` dimension value is provided as an argument to `imagecrop()`, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow: Due to the integer overflow, a larger-than-allocated buffer is written to on the heap.
- Lack of input validation/sanitization:  The `gdImageCrop()` function doesn't sufficiently check the input `x` dimension value, allowing it to become excessively large and leading to the overflow.
- Missing return value checks: The code doesn't check the return value of `gdImageCreate()` or `gdImageCreateTrueColor()`, which are called internally by `imagecrop`. These function can return NULL on allocation failure, which is subsequently used without checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: A successful exploit can cause an application crash due to the heap overflow or NULL pointer dereference.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: Although not explicitly stated, heap overflows are often exploitable for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted image data to a PHP script that uses the vulnerable `imagecrop()` function.
- Invalid imagecrop arguments: By providing a large value for the x dimension or other invalid imagecrop arguments such as negative dimension, or strings in place of numbers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send input to a PHP script: The attacker must be able to send input, specifically the parameters to be passed to the imagecrop() function, to a vulnerable PHP script. This can be achieved in various ways such as through user-submitted data (e.g., form uploads or API calls), or by directly manipulating variables.
- No special user privileges are required, and the script will crash with the privileges of the user running the PHP script.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability was fixed in PHP 5.5.9.
- The issue is present in the libgd library and the PHP gd extension.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry suggests that the vulnerability does not affect versions of PHP or libgd shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, or Red Hat Software Collections 1.
- The content indicates that a similar issue, which also leads to a crash, involves passing a string value for a numeric parameter, but it was considered a bug instead of a security vulnerability.
- The content from php.net indicates that integer overflows can cause heap corruption and out-of-bounds writes, and mentions that some issues were fixed in php 5.5.10
