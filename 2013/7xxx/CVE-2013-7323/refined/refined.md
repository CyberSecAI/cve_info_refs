Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-7323:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2013-7323 is the **unrestricted use of unquoted strings** in a shell within `python-gnupg` before version 0.3.5. Specifically, the application did not properly sanitize or quote user-provided input before passing it to the shell.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Shell Injection:** The primary vulnerability is shell injection. Because user-provided strings were not properly escaped or quoted when passed to the shell, an attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary command execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the system running the affected application. This could lead to a full compromise of the system, including data theft, malware installation, denial of service, or any other action the attacker's chosen commands could perform.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Manipulated input strings:** Attackers could craft malicious strings containing shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `$(...)`, `` `...` ``) to be passed as input to the python-gnupg library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to control input:** The attacker would need to be able to control the input strings that are processed by the vulnerable python-gnupg library. This might occur if the application using the library takes user input or data from an external source without proper validation or sanitization before passing it to `python-gnupg`.

**More details:**
The identified weaknesses are related to the `shell_quote` function in python-gnupg, specifically that:
1. The function before version 0.3.5 did not properly quote shell input and was thus vulnerable to shell injection.
2. Version 0.3.5 made an attempt to fix the vulnerability using double quotes (`"`) which is insufficient because these characters do not behave the same way as single quotes (`'`) in shell environments. The usage of `$(command)` inside double quotes will still be evaluated by the shell, while the same inside single quotes would be passed as a literal string. This can allow for command execution.
3. Version 0.3.5 also incorrectly inserted backslashes (`\`) which can be used to create command lists with the usage of semicolons (`;`).

It's worth noting that the content indicates that this vulnerability was addressed in `python-gnupg` version 0.3.6. Additionally, the provided information indicates that there were multiple closely related vulnerabilities discovered and assigned different CVEs, which are:
- CVE-2014-1927: Erroneous assumptions about the usability of " characters within version 0.3.5
- CVE-2014-1928: Erroneous insertion of a \ character within version 0.3.5
