## Synopsis

Low: conga security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0128)

## Topic

Updated conga packages that fix one security issue, multiple bugs, and add
two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The Conga project is a management system for remote workstations. It
consists of luci, which is a secure web-based front end, and ricci, which
is a secure daemon that dispatches incoming messages to underlying
management modules.

It was discovered that luci stored usernames and passwords in session
cookies. This issue prevented the session inactivity timeout feature from
working correctly, and allowed attackers able to get access to a session
cookie to obtain the victim's authentication credentials. (CVE-2012-3359)

Red Hat would like to thank George Hedfors of Cybercom Sweden East AB for
reporting this issue.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, luci did not allow the fence\_apc\_snmp agent to be

configured. As a consequence, users could not configure or view an existing
configuration for fence\_apc\_snmp. This update adds a new screen that allows
fence\_apc\_snmp to be configured. (BZ#832181)

* Prior to this update, luci did not allow the SSL operation of the

fence\_ilo fence agent to be enabled or disabled. As a consequence, users
could not configure or view an existing configuration for the 'ssl'
attribute for fence\_ilo. This update adds a checkbox to show whether the
SSL operation is enabled and allows users to edit that attribute.
(BZ#832183)

* Prior to this update, luci did not allow the "identity\_file" attribute of

the fence\_ilo\_mp fence agent to be viewed or edited. As a consequence,
users could not configure or view an existing configuration for the
"identity\_file" attribute of the fence\_ilo\_mp fence agent. This update adds
a text input box to show the current state of the "identity\_file" attribute
of fence\_ilo\_mp and allows users to edit that attribute. (BZ#832185)

* Prior to this update, redundant files and directories remained on the

file system at /var/lib/luci/var/pts and /usr/lib{,64}/luci/zope/var/pts
when the luci package was uninstalled. This update removes these files
and directories when the luci package is uninstalled. (BZ#835649)

* Prior to this update, the "restart-disable" recovery policy was not

displayed in the recovery policy list from which users could select when
they configure a recovery policy for a failover domain. As a consequence,
the "restart-disable" recovery policy could not be set with the luci GUI.
This update adds the "restart-disable" recovery option to the recovery
policy pulldown list. (BZ#839732)

* Prior to this update, line breaks that were not anticipated in the "yum

list" output could cause package upgrade and/or installation to fail when
creating clusters or adding nodes to existing clusters. As a consequence,
creating clusters and adding cluster nodes to existing clusters could fail.
This update modifies the ricci daemon to be able to correctly handle line
breaks in the "yum list" output. (BZ#842865)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

* This update adds support for configuring the Intel iPDU fence agent to

the luci package. (BZ#741986)

* This update adds support for viewing and changing the state of the new

'nfsrestart' attribute to the FS and Cluster FS resource agent
configuration screens. (BZ#822633)

All users of conga are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this
update, the luci and ricci services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=607179#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-06-23 13:05:20 UTC  ``` It was reported that Luci's (Luci is a web based front-end component of the Conga cluster management system) user session timeout feature depended only on JavaScript script running in the user's browser.  If user closed browser tab without logging out of Luci session and without closing browser, they could re-open Luci web interface and continue using the session even after the timeout period has elapsed.

Further investigation of this problem uncovered additional problems in the Luci's session handling.  After opening Luci session, __ac session cookie was set.  The value for this cookie was not an opaque identifier for the server-side session, but it contained base64 encoded string containing user's user name and password.  Therefore if an attacker was able to obtain __ac cookie value, they could authenticate to Luci as the victim regardless of any session timeouts.  Upcoming Conga update improves Luci session handling in several ways: - user name and password is no longer stored in cookie - session cookie value is now an opaque identifier for the server-side session - session inactivity timeouts are enforced on the server side   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=607179#c32)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-08 05:09:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=607179#c35)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-31 04:36:26 UTC  ``` From RHSA-2013:0128:  It was discovered that luci stored usernames and passwords in session cookies. This issue prevented the session inactivity timeout feature from working correctly, and allowed attackers able to get access to a session cookie to obtain the victim's authentication credentials. ([CVE-2012-3359](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3359))  MITRE has split the CVEs:  - [CVE-2012-3359](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3359) is for the "luci stored usernames and passwords in session cookies" part  - [CVE-2013-7347](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7347) is for the "session inactivity timeout feature" not working correctly   ``` |  |
