Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7347:

**Verification:**
The provided content includes references to CVE-2013-7347 and clearly identifies that this CVE relates to the "session inactivity timeout feature" of the luci web interface not working correctly. This aligns with the description in the bug report and the Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2013:0128).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is that the luci web interface session timeout mechanism was primarily client-side (JavaScript-based). This means if a user closed a browser tab or window without logging out, the session could be resumed after the timeout period had elapsed, effectively bypassing the timeout. Additionally, the session cookie (`__ac`) contained base64 encoded username and password, not an opaque identifier for a server side session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Session Handling:** The session inactivity timeout was not correctly enforced server-side.
*   **Credential Exposure in Cookies:**  Usernames and passwords were stored in session cookies, which could be intercepted by attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker who gained access to a user's session cookie could:
*   Bypass session inactivity timeout and resume a user session.
*   Gain access to the victim's authentication credentials.
*   Authenticate to luci as a legitimate user, gaining access to the cluster management system.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
*   Stealing a valid session cookie. This could be done through network eavesdropping, cross-site scripting (XSS), or by gaining physical access to the victim's computer.
*   Replaying the stolen cookie to gain unauthorized access to the luci web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to obtain a valid session cookie from a legitimate user.
*   The attacker must have network access to the luci web interface.

**Additional Details (From Bugzilla Comment):**
*   The original vulnerability report mentioned the client-side timeout issue.
*   Further investigation revealed that the session cookie contained base64-encoded username and password.

**Summary of Fix:**
The update (RHSA-2013:0128) addresses the vulnerability by:
*   No longer storing usernames and passwords in session cookies.
*   Making session cookie value an opaque identifier for the server-side session.
*   Enforcing session inactivity timeouts on the server-side.
