Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7054:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization and validation on the server-side of the D-Link DIR-100 router's web interface. Specifically, user-provided input is not checked for special characters before being stored and displayed, leading to the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79:** The primary vulnerability described for CVE-2013-7054 is persistent XSS. The router's web interface allows authenticated users to store arbitrary JavaScript code which is then executed when an administrator accesses the interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the router's configuration. When an administrator accesses the affected pages, the injected code will be executed within the administrator's browser in the context of the D-Link DIR-100 web interface. This could enable the attacker to:
    *   Steal administrator session cookies
    *   Perform actions on the router as the administrator
    *   Potentially further compromise the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the router's web interface.
*   An attacker must first gain access to the router and authenticate (or exploit another vulnerability to gain admin access).
*   The attacker then injects malicious javascript code through specific parameters such as:
    *   DHCP static IP address configuration
    *   Scheduler configuration

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the D-Link DIR-100's web interface.
*   The attacker needs to send specific crafted requests to store malicious JavaScript code through vulnerable parameters to the router via the `/cli.cgi` script.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document provides concrete examples and proof-of-concept exploit code using `curl` commands for injecting malicious scripts via the `dhcps` and `sched2` parameters. This makes it clear how to trigger the XSS.
*   The report explicitly mentions that client-side (javascript) input filtering is in place, but the vulnerability exists because server-side validation is missing.

This information provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description, outlining how to exploit the vulnerability.
