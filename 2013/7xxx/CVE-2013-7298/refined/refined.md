Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7298:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the parsing logic of HTTP query parameters within the cxxtools library. Specifically, the library's URL parser enters an infinite recursive loop when it encounters two consecutive percent signs (`%%`) in a query parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite Recursion: The core weakness is an infinite recursive loop triggered by the double percent signs in the query parameters, leading to excessive resource consumption.
- Lack of Proper Input Validation: The code doesn't correctly handle or sanitize the input, particularly the double percent signs, leading to the exploitable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is a denial-of-service attack. By sending a crafted HTTP request containing the malicious query parameter, an attacker can cause the server to crash due to the infinite loop, making the service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request to the server.
- HTTP Query parameters: The attack vector is specifically through malformed HTTP query parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
- HTTP Request Generation: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests, including the specific malicious query parameter with double percent signs.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in cxxtools versions 2.2 and earlier, and is fixed in version 2.2.1.
- The fix addresses the parsing logic to prevent the infinite recursion when double percent signs are encountered.
- The vulnerability was reported by Julian Wiesener
