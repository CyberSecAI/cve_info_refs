# CVE requests / advisory: cxxtools <= 2.2, Tntnet <= 2.2

---

*From*: Matthew Daley <mattd () bugfuzz com>

*Date*: Sat, 18 Jan 2014 14:43:23 +1300

```
Hi,

I'd like to request CVE IDs for these 2 issues. They were found in
software from the Tntnet Project (www.tntnet.org), which develop
Tntnet, an open-source web server for C++ web applications.

This is the first such request and the issues are (now) public; this
message serves as an advisory as well.

* Issue #1

Affected software: cxxtools
Description: By sending a crafted HTTP query parameter containing two
percent signs in a row, URL parsing would enter an infinite recursive
loop, leading to a crash. This allows a remote attacker to DOS the
server.
Affected versions: current releases (<= 2.2)
Fixed in version: 2.2.1
Fix: <https://github.com/maekitalo/cxxtools/commit/142bb2589dc184709857c08c1e10570947c444e3>
Release notes: <http://www.tntnet.org/download/cxxtools-2.2.1/Releasenotes-2.2.1.markdown>
Reported by: Julian Wiesener

* Issue #2

Affected software: Tntnet
Description: By sending a crafted HTTP request that uses "\n" to end
its headers instead of the expected "\r\n", it is possible that
headers from a previous unrelated request will seemingly be appended
to the crafted request (due to a missing null termination). This
allows a remote attacker to use sensitive headers from other users'
requests in their own requests, such as cookies or HTTP authentication
credentials.
Affected versions: current releases  (<= 2.2)
Fixed in version: 2.2.1
Fix: <https://github.com/maekitalo/tntnet/commit/9bd3b14042e12d84f39ea9f55731705ba516f525>
and <https://github.com/maekitalo/tntnet/commit/9d1a859e28b78bfbf769689454b529ac7709dee4>
Release notes: <http://www.tntnet.org/download/tntnet-2.2.1/Releasenotes-2.2.1.markdown>
Reported by: Matthew Daley

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thanks,

- Matthew Daley

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
