Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-7085

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `uscan` script in `devscripts` improperly handles filenames containing whitespace when the `USCAN_EXCLUSION` option is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Input Handling:** The `uscan` script fails to correctly sanitize or escape filenames with whitespace when processing exclusions, leading to command injection when it passes the filenames to other commands.
- **Command Injection:** The vulnerability occurs due to the way filenames are passed to the `rm` command, specifically through `xargs`, which can be tricked with whitespace into deleting files that were not intended to be deleted based on the user supplied exclusions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A malicious actor (e.g., a compromised upstream source) can craft filenames containing whitespace that, when processed by `uscan` with exclusions, can cause the deletion of arbitrary files on the system where `uscan` is executed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Upstream Source:** An attacker can create a malicious tarball containing filenames with whitespace characters.
- **USCAN_EXCLUSION Enabled:** The vulnerability is triggered when `uscan` is run with the `USCAN_EXCLUSION` option enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a tarball containing malicious filenames which will be processed by `uscan`. Typically, this would be through a compromised or malicious upstream source.
- The user running `uscan` must have the `USCAN_EXCLUSION` option enabled in its configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in `devscripts` version 2.13.5.
- The fix involves using `find`'s `-exec` to call `rm` directly, rather than piping through `xargs` and addresses several other security related issues.
- A proof of concept was provided with the bug report which would result in deletion of `/usr`.
