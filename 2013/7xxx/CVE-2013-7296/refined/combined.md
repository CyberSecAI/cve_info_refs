# CVE Request - Poppler library: DoS fixed in 0.24.5

---

*From*: "mancha" <mancha1 () hush com>

*Date*: Thu, 16 Jan 2014 18:55:24 +0000

```
Hello.

It was discovered the JBIG2Stream::readSegments function in the
Poppler library (prior to 0.24.5) does not properly handle
segExtraBytes values, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (application crash) via a crafted PDF that
triggers a segmentation fault caused by an improper format
control string. [1]

Upstream fix:
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=58e04a08afee>

Would you please allocate a CVE for this issue? Thanks.

It will be fixed in poppler 0.24.5 ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1048199#c0)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-03 11:21:40 UTC  ``` Poppler was recently reported to be vulnerable to a flaw, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) in an application using the library.  The vulnerability is caused due to a format string error when handling extraneous bytes within a segment in the "JBIG2Stream::readSegments()" method in JBIG2Stream.cc, which can be exploited to cause a crash.  The issue is said to be fixed in Poppler 0.24.5.  References: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=496770> <https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=328511> (okular)  Commit: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=58e04a08afee39370283c494ee2e4e392fd3b684>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1048199#c2)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-03 11:23:24 UTC  ```  Created mingw-poppler tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1048203](show_bug.cgi?id=1048203 "CLOSED ERRATA - mingw-poppler: poppler: DoS due to a format string error [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1048199#c3)  Ratul Gupta    2014-01-03 11:23:27 UTC  ```  Created poppler tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1048202](show_bug.cgi?id=1048202 "CLOSED ERRATA - poppler: DoS due to a format string error [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1048199#c5)  Fedora Update System    2014-01-05 06:07:13 UTC  ``` poppler-0.24.3-3.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

Sidhpurwala    2014-01-06 08:13:09 UTC  ``` In the version of poppler shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, vulnerable format string is not used. Upstream uses "{0:d}" while the Red Hat Enterprise Linux version uses "%d". Secondly the upstream version of poppler uses a custom defined error() function (in poppler/Error.cc), while in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux version, error() is just a wrapper around the glibc error() function.  Therefore this issue does not affect the version of poppler in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1048199#c7)  Huzaifa S.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
