Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-7246

**Root Cause:** The `IconCreate` method in DaumGame ActiveX versions 1.1.0.5 and 1.1.0.4 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. This method is designed to handle icon processing and accepts printable characters as input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The `IconCreate` method lacks proper input validation and boundary checks, allowing a large input string to overwrite memory beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **SEH Overwrite:** The buffer overflow leads to overwriting the Structured Exception Handler (SEH), a mechanism used by Windows to manage exceptions and errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overwriting the SEH with a controlled address, an attacker can gain control of the program's execution flow and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates this by executing a harmless calculator, however, the shellcode could be modified to perform more malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **ActiveX Control:** The vulnerability exists within an ActiveX control, which is typically embedded in web pages.
*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious HTML page containing the vulnerable ActiveX control. When a user visits this page with a vulnerable version of the DaumGame ActiveX installed, the buffer overflow can be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Website Hosting:** The attacker needs a platform to host the malicious HTML page with the exploit.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must visit the attacker-controlled web page while having a vulnerable version of the DaumGame ActiveX installed.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit leverages the `IconCreate` method of the `16B6A027-2732-4028-9303-EFE3E95EF766` ActiveX control.
*   The Proof of Concept (PoC) uses a long string of `%05` characters to trigger the buffer overflow, followed by shellcode to execute a calculator.
* The SEH overwrite uses an address from msls31.dll to gain control of EIP.
* The PoC provides a specific HTML page (`daumgame.html`) that embeds the vulnerable ActiveX object, which is required for triggering the exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Daniel Chechik of Trustwave SpiderLabs.
*   The vendor (Daum) released a fix in version 1.1.0.6.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer).
