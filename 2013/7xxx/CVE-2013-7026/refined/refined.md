{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the shared memory (shm) implementation where IPC_RMID can race with other shm operations, potentially leading to a use-after-free of the shm object's associated file (shm_file).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impacts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Unprivileged local user"
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Set shm_file=NULL in shm_destroy() while holding ipc_object_lock().",
    "Modify at-risk operations to check shm_file while holding ipc_object_lock()."
  ],
  "details": "The vulnerability arises because `shm_destroy()` calls `fput()` after dropping the `ipc_lock`, clearing the file's `f_inode`, `f_path.dentry`, and `f_path.mnt`. This can cause NULL pointer dereferences in other tasks still operating on the shared memory. The fix ensures the `shm_file` pointer is set to NULL while holding the lock and checks for a valid `shm_file` pointer before further operations, preventing use-after-free."
