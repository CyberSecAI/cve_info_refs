  "CVE-2013-7310": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol does not specify unique Link State Advertisement (LSA) lookup identifiers, which allow an attacker to intercept traffic or conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.",
    "details": "The OSPF protocol requires LSA's to be identified by: LS Type, Advertising Router, and Link State ID. However, during the routing table calculation phase, the specification states that a LSA is queried in the LSA database using only the Link State ID. Since the Link State ID is used in the LSA database to identify a particular router, a malformed duplicate entry can cause unexpected and insecure implementation-specific behavior. In some implementations, the vulnerability can allow an attacker to subvert the routing table of victim router by sending false link state advertisements on behalf of other routers. This subversion can cause the victim router to drop the entire table (denial of service) or to re-route traffic on the network.",
    "affected_components": [
        "OSPF protocol implementations"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The OSPF protocol specification does not require the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields to match when a router receives an OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA).",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can re-route traffic, compromising the confidentiality of the data, or conduct a denial-of-service attack against a router, dropping all traffic. An attacker can inject false routes into the OSPF database, add routes, overwrite routes, and clear the OSPF database.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted OSPF Router LSAs with mismatched Link State ID and Router ID to a vulnerable router."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have control of a router within the same Autonomous System (AS) as the target or have unfiltered access to an OSPF interface that is not using MD5 authentication. The attacker needs to be able to spoof a legitimate OSPF peer or send a crafted LSA on an interface where an OSPF peer is already present."
