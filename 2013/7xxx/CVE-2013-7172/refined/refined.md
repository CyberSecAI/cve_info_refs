{
  "CVE-2013-7172": {
    "Description": "Slackware 13.1, 13.37, 14.0 and 14.1 contain world-writable permissions on the iodbctest and iodbctestw programs within the libiodbc package, which could allow local users to use RPATH information to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
    "Root cause": "Insecure RPATH in the iodbctest and iodbctestw binaries within the libiodbc package.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "World-writable permissions on the vulnerable binaries.",
      "Insecure RPATH setting, pointing to a potentially attacker-controlled directory such as `/tmp`."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Exploiting world-writable permissions to overwrite vulnerable binaries with malicious code.",
      "Manipulating the RPATH setting to load malicious libraries when the vulnerable binaries are executed."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system is required to exploit this vulnerability."
  }
}
