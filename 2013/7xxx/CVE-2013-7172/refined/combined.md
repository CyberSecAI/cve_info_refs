### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Use CVE-2013-7171.

Use CVE-2013-7172.

A "Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001" line actually doesn't mean that the patch
occurred in September 2001. That date is hardcoded into the git source
code; see the <https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/log-tree.c> file.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1044846#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-19 05:41:58 UTC  ``` It was reported that the iodbctest and iodbctestw tools provided by the libiodbc package had an insecure RPATH (/tmp/) entry:  <http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Dec/93>  This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the affected tools.  This issue did not affect the libiodbc packages in Fedora or EPEL, as the packages are built in /buildir/ and not /tmp/.  CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q4/525>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1044846#c1)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-20 03:45:15 UTC  ``` [CVE-2013-7172](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7172) was assigned to this issue: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q4/527>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1044846#c2)  Rex Dieter    2013-12-20 19:09:22 UTC  ``` As an addendum to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1044846#c1) about fedora/epel packages not being vulnerable, we explicitly delete the rpaths from the binaries in question as part of the build process (using chrpath --delete)   ``` |  |
