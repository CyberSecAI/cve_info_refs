Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7445:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper accounting of memory allocations made by the graphics driver (DRI) on behalf of a process. Specifically, the GEM (Graphics Execution Manager) and TTM (Translation Table Manager) within the DRI framework do not accurately track memory usage when allocating memory on the GPU. This leads to the system's Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer and resource limits (rlimits) being ineffective.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Memory Accounting:** The core issue is the lack of proper accounting for GPU memory allocations performed by the DRI drivers. These allocations are not correctly attributed to the requesting processes.
*   **Ineffective Resource Limits:** Because memory is not accounted for, the standard OS resource limit mechanisms fail to prevent a single process from consuming excessive amounts of memory, including both RAM and swap. This includes cgroups based limitations as well.
*   **Denial of Service:** By triggering uncontrolled memory allocation via a crafted web page, an attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by exhausting available memory resources on the target system, leading to system freezes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Freeze:** A primary impact of exploitation is a system freeze, where the entire system becomes unresponsive. This is characterized by extreme slowdowns, lagging mouse pointer movement, sluggish keyboard input, and difficulties in switching to TTY consoles.
*   **Swap Overload:** The system attempts to use swap memory to compensate for RAM exhaustion. The heavy swap activity contributes to the overall system slowness.
*   **Application Termination:** As the system runs out of resources, applications can be terminated, and launching new applications can become very difficult or impossible. This is primarily due to OOM conditions arising from the unmanaged GEM object allocations.
*   **Remote Killswitch:** This vulnerability can effectively act as a remote killswitch for affected Linux systems if they have a browser.
*   **Other drivers affected:** It is also stated that other drivers and OSes are affected by the same root cause issue.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Web Page:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page using technologies such as HTML (potentially using image decompression bombs or similar techniques) that triggers excessive memory allocations.
*   **Browser as an Attack Vector:** By simply opening the crafted HTML page in a web browser (such as Chrome, Iceweasel), a user can trigger the memory exhaustion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker can be remote, as the primary attack vector is through a web page delivered over the network.
*   **Ability to serve web page:** The attacker needs the ability to host the malicious HTML page, either through their own infrastructure or by compromising a legitimate web server.
*   **Target system must have an open driver:** The system targeted must be using an affected open-source graphics driver.
*   **User interaction:** The victim must open the malicious web page using a browser.

**Additional Information:**

*   The bug affects multiple graphics drivers, including Intel, AMD, and Nouveau.
*   The issue was observed on multiple kernel versions including 3.10, 3.11, 3.14 and 4.0, and affects a range of devices including Chromebooks and Android devices.
*   The issue is not reliably mitigated by setting vm.overcommit_memory to 2.
*   The vulnerability is triggered via excessive GEM object allocations.
*   The issue was initially misidentified as a Chrome browser bug but later determined to be a kernel vulnerability.
*   The fix would require per-file OOM handling as well as properly attributing allocations to the requesting process.
