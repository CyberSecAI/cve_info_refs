| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c0)  Mikhail    2013-07-08 05:14:08 UTC  ``` System became terrible unresponsible during swap process. Switching to tty console gave heavy delay. All programms are stuck. Even mouse pointer begins moving jerks. After end swap process system begins respond. By "end swap process" I mean stop hdd activity. Large amount of memory is still used and still stored on disk. Even any little increasing swap stuck my system. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c1)  Mikhail    2013-07-08 13:55:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 106839](attachment.cgi?id=106839 "htop screenshot") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=106839&action=edit "htop screenshot") htop screenshot ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c2)  Mikhail    2013-07-08 14:27:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 106840](attachment.cgi?id=106840 "htop screenshot") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=106840&action=edit "htop screenshot") htop screenshot ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c3)  Mikhail    2013-07-08 15:00:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 106841](attachment.cgi?id=106841 "htop screenshot") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=106841&action=edit "htop screenshot") htop screenshot ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c4)  Mikhail    2013-07-09 04:39:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 106846](attachment.cgi?id=106846 "htop screenshot") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=106846&action=edit "htop screenshot") htop screenshot ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c5)  Mikhail    2013-08-04 04:56:18 UTC  ``` You can quickly reproduce this if open in Google Chrome this link: <http://ec2-54-229-117-209.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/party.html> ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c6)  Alan    2013-11-13 19:33:32 UTC  ``` This appears to be a google chrome bug in that it tries to allocate most of your memory - you might want to set vm overcommit to disallow heavy overcommit then chrome would I think be killed ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c7)  Mikhail    2013-11-13 19:50:20 UTC  ``` I expected that a system with 32Gb of memory will just invincible, but I see that when process kswapd is active it also slows as my other machine on which only 3Gb of memory.  It's a shame that any application can cause DDOS system only allocated more memory. I would like to brake only application that allocates memory and not the entire system. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c8)  Mikhail    2013-12-14 09:27:03 UTC  ``` vm.overcommit_memory = 2 not helps prevent system freeze ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c9)  Mikhail    2013-12-14 09:28:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 118351](attachment.cgi?id=118351 "html for demonstrate system freeze") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=118351&action=edit "html for demonstrate system freeze") html for demonstrate system freeze ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c10)  inbox-bpnyjac    2013-12-22 09:42:07 UTC  ``` I confirm this, Kernel 3.11-9 (liquorix build) on Debian Testing x64, ICEWEASEL 17.09. The system is Athlon II X4 630 quadcore with 8 GiB of RAM and 8 GiB of swap. Clicking on attachment makes the system freeze within 4 seconds, mouse is heavily slowed down and lagging in 5 second steps. Response to keyboard is very slow. Clicking on tab close does not bring anything.  According to htop, 8GiB of RAM and 4GiB of swap were occupied and growing. The case seems to be Kernel vulnerable to denial of service due to performing swap operations as required by unpriviliged process (iceweasel).  This is NOT google chrome bug, it is kernel exploit.   I was able to switch to TTY, start htop and issue a KILL 15 to firefox (iceweasel). It took about 50 seconds to be killed. The system then easily recovered as I was able to switch back to running Xorg. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c11)  inbox-bpnyjac    2013-12-22 09:46:22 UTC  ``` I suggest to limit the program to the amount of RAM it can get within specified time line, some kind of ulimit. Because the process essentially asks for tremedous amount of RAM and causes whole system to freeze.  I don't think that decreasing swapping priority is a good idea, as there are programs that might need less barbaric amounts of RAM causing the system to go into swap, and THAT will slow them all down. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c12)  Alan    2013-12-22 22:20:55 UTC  ``` It's both a chrome bug and a kernel bug. Chrome shouldn't consume arbitary amounts of memory due to untrusted input and the kernel should have killed it off if resource limits were set. For some reason the latter isn't occuring reliably. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c13)  Alan    2013-12-27 21:27:04 UTC  ``` Testing a few things this seems to be a graphics driver problem. If I am software rendering and have memory overcommit set to 2 then the kernel says no and chrome gives the 'Aw snap!' window.  I wonder if its allocation a bazillion GEM objects and these are not being properly accounted or something. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c14)  Alan    2013-12-27 21:27:33 UTC  ``` (tentatively reassigning to the graphics guys given that software render + overcommit management seems to fix it) ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c15)  inbox-bpnyjac    2013-12-27 23:48:41 UTC  ``` hello, r600g with amd machine specified before, and also samsung r60 plus (r300g) laptop are affected. ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c16)  Daniel Vetter    2014-01-07 20:29:45 UTC  ``` Both gem and ttm don't account memory allocations for the gpu done on behalf of a process properly to those process. So the OOM badness calculations and rlimits are both ineffective. I've thought cgroups would track kernel memory allocations done in process context (and hence should work properly), but Alan said on irc that cgroups isn't effective, either.  Definitely more a feature request than bug imo since this has been missing from the start. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c17)  Daniel Vetter    2014-01-07 20:30:24 UTC  ``` Might be a fun gsoc project to fix this ... ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c18)  Mikhail    2014-01-27 10:14:29 UTC  ``` why DRI - Intel? With nouveau and AMD driver same issue. :( ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c19)  Alan    2014-01-27 10:32:29 UTC  ``` There isn't a way to assign the bug to both Intel and AMD and Nouveau at once - it does affect all three, and it is DRI related. Disable DRI and overcommit works properly on all the platforms affected (and its quite a wide range - it takes out chromebooks, some Android phones, ....) ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c20)  iakrevetko    2014-05-09 13:11:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to Mikhail from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c5)) > You can quickly reproduce this if open in Google Chrome this link: > <http://ec2-54-229-117-209.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/party.html>  Can confirm.

And all applications which I tried to launch under remote terminal launched longer than usual. ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c24)  Mikhail    2015-04-10 08:43:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 173711](attachment.cgi?id=173711 "Trying connect from phone to sshd when GUI interface stuck") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=173711&action=edit "Trying connect from phone to sshd when GUI interface stuck") Trying connect from phone to sshd when GUI interface stuck ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c25)  Mikhail    2015-04-10 08:46:17 UTC  ``` Hey Alan are you here?  Let us assume that the blame for the graphics subsystem. Then why slow down sshd so much that I could not connected? ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c26)  inbox-bpnyjac    2015-04-16 21:49:23 UTC  ``` Basically, this is a REMOTE KILLSWITCH for *any* affected (any open driver) Linux system, if it has a browser.  I don't understand why its "enhancement"?!  Its crystal clear how it works - by requesting allocation of huge amount of graphical data via html (image decompression bomb, similar to old tar bombs but via JPG or similar) to a browser, it causes massive requests for RAM/GEM objects. This causes typical symptoms of RAM shortage: drop and termination of caches, reallocation of large parts of kernel into swap (making whole system extremely slow), termination of running userspace applications and refusal to execute any new ones.  These requests go completely through any of limiters.  Which means - send *any* target Linux system, known to use open driver, a link to a crafted html web page, and it will cease to function in a matter of seconds and will not recover by itself. Unless its equipped with a hexabyte of RAM - then it would survive for a minute. ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c27)  Alan    2015-04-17 13:18:57 UTC  ``` MIkhail: Because it ate all the memory   Is this still seen with current kernels (4.0 era) ? ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c28)  Mikhail    2015-04-17 13:20:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alan from [comment #27](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c27)) > MIkhail: Because it ate all the memory >  >  > Is this still seen with current kernels (4.0 era) ?  yes  $ uname -r 4.0.0-1.fc22.i686+PAE ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=60533#c29)  Alan    2015-04-17 13:26:47 UTC  ``` Thanks..
