Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7422:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `S_regmatch()` function in Perl. This function does not properly check arguments before passing them to the `atoi()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The lack of proper checks before calling `atoi()` indicates a failure to validate or sanitize input data. This allows for potentially malicious input to be processed, leading to the vulnerability.
*   **Integer Underflow:**  Specifically, the Apple document mentions an "integer underflow issue" in how Perl parses regular expressions related to this CVE. This further explains the nature of the improper input handling leading to the vulnerability.
* **Invalid Backreference Handling:** The Ubuntu and Launchpad documents specifically mention that the vulnerability is related to "certain regular expressions with an invalid backreference".  This detail is missing in other sources and provides a clearer understanding of how the vulnerability is triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted input that causes Perl to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition. This is the primary impact mentioned in most sources.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The Ubuntu notice suggests that exploitation could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution, in addition to a crash. The Apple document mentions, "Parsing a maliciously crafted regular expression may lead to disclosure of unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution," indicating that it is a possible outcome depending on the details of exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted input to a Perl application.
*   **Regular Expression:** The vulnerability involves crafted input within regular expressions, specifically related to how backreferences are handled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to a vulnerable Perl application.
*   **Crafting Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to create or manipulate input that triggers the vulnerability through the flawed regular expression handling in `S_regmatch()`.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs an understanding of the specific input that triggers the vulnerable code path in Perl.

**Additional Notes:**
*  The Gentoo advisory specifies that the vulnerable versions of perl are `< 5.20.1-r4`. The Gentoo advisory also mentions that the exploit is "remote", and the severity is normal.
* The Ubuntu advisory also mentions that versions 15.10, 14.04 ESM, and 12.04 are affected.
*  The Apple security advisory indicates that this issue was addressed by improved memory handling in their version of perl.
* The Launchpad changelog provides information on how the vulnerability was patched (specifically addressing "big backreferences in regcomp.c").

In summary, CVE-2013-7422 is a vulnerability in Perl's regular expression handling, specifically related to backreferences and integer underflows. It can be exploited by a remote attacker sending crafted input to cause a denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `S_regmatch` function before using `atoi`, and can be triggered by manipulating backreferences within regular expressions.
