# USN-2916-1: Perl vulnerabilities

2 March 2016

Several security issues were fixed in Perl.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) - Practical Extraction and Report Language

## Details

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain regular expressions

with an invalid backreference. An attacker could use this issue to cause

Perl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-7422](/security/CVE-2013-7422))

Markus Vervier discovered that Perl incorrectly handled nesting in the

Data::Dumper module. An attacker could use this issue to cause Perl to

consume memory and crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-4330](/security/CVE-2014-4330))

Stephane Chazelas discovered that Perl incorrectly handled duplicate

environment variables. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass

the taint protection mechanism. ([CVE-2016-2381](/security/CVE-2016-2381))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl)
  -
  [5.20.2-6ubuntu0.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl/5.20.2-6ubuntu0.2)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl)
  -
  [5.18.2-2ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl/5.18.2-2ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl)
  -
  [5.14.2-6ubuntu2.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/perl/5.14.2-6ubuntu2.5)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

## Binary packages built by this source

[libcgi-fast-perl](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libcgi-fast-perl):
CGI::Fast Perl module

CGI::Fast is a subclass of the CGI object created by CGI.pm. It is

 specialized to work well with the Open Market FastCGI standard, which

 greatly speeds up CGI scripts by turning them into persistently running

 server processes. Scripts that perform time-consuming initialization

 processes, such as loading large modules or opening persistent database

 connections, will see large performance improvements.

[libperl-dev](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libperl-dev):
Perl library: development files

Files for developing applications which embed a Perl interpreter.

[libperl5.14](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libperl5.14):
shared Perl library

This package is required by programs which embed a Perl interpreter to

 ensure that the correct version of `perl-base' is installed. It

 additionally contains the shared Perl library on architectures where the

 perl binary is linked to libperl.a (currently only i386, for performance

 reasons). In other cases the actual library is in the `perl-base' package.

[perl](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl):
Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language

An interpreted scripting language, known among some as "Unix's Swiss

 Army Chainsaw".

 .

 Perl is optimised for scanning arbitrary text files and system

 administration. It has built-in extended regular expression matching

 and replacement, a data-flow mechanism to improve security with

 setuid scripts and is extensible via modules that can interface to C

 libraries.

[perl-base](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl-base):
minimal Perl system

Perl is a scripting language used in many system scripts and utilities.

 .

 This package provides a Perl interpreter and the small subset of the

 standard run-time library required to perform basic tasks. For a full

 Perl installation, install "perl" (and its dependencies, "perl-modules"

 and "perl-doc").

[perl-debug](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl-debug):
debug-enabled Perl interpreter

debugperl provides a debug-enabled version of Perl which can produce

 extensive information about the interpreter as it compiles and executes

 a program (see the -D switch in perlrun(1)).

 .

 Note that this package is primarily of use in debugging \*Perl\* rather

 than perl programs, which may be traced/debugged using the standard

 perl binary using the -d switch (see perldebug(1)).

[perl-doc](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl-doc):
Perl documentation

Perl manual pages, POD documentation and the `perldoc' program. If you are

 writing Perl programs, you almost certainly need this.

[perl-modules](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl-modules):
Core Perl modules

Architecture independent Perl modules. These modules are part of Perl and

 required if the `perl' package is installed.

 .

 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be

 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.

 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules' directly, they

 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules') instead.

| [Description](#c0)  Sindre Aamås    2003-05-25 09:57:04 UTC  ``` The -march=pentium4 problem seems to be generally solved in gcc-3.2.3 and gcc-3.3, so -march=pentium4 shouldn't be replaced with -march=pentium3 for >=gcc-3.2.3. This applies for the mozilla/firebird/phoenix ebuilds, and probably for any other ebuilds where -march=pentium4 is replaced.  I have successfully compiled mozilla with -march=pentium4 using gcc-3.2.3-r1.  This is the part of the mozilla ebuild that needs to be changed: if [ "$(gcc-major-version)" -eq "3" ] 	then 		# Currently gcc-3.2 or older do not work well if we specify "-march" 		# and other optimizations for pentium4. 		export CFLAGS="${CFLAGS/-march=pentium4/-march=pentium3}" 		export CXXFLAGS="${CXXFLAGS/-march=pentium4/-march=pentium3}"  This should be adjusted to only apply for gcc-versions older than gcc-3.2.3.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install gcc-3.2.3 or newer on a pc with an Intel Pentium4 processor. 2. Edit your CFLAGS to include -march=pentium4. 3. Edit the mozilla ebuild to not replace -march=pentium4 with -march=pentium3. Then emerge mozilla. It should work without a problem.  Actual Results:   Emerged and ran successfully.  Expected Results:   Should have given me an error when compiling, or other errors after, if the -march=pentium4 replacement was needed. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Nick Fish    2003-06-11 18:31:25 UTC  ``` I've had -march=pentium4 ever since I installed Gentoo on my new workstation.  I bootstrapped with gcc-3.2.3.  I haven't had any stability or otherwise atypical problems.  #cat /proc/cpuinfo processor	: 0 vendor_id	: GenuineIntel cpu family	: 15 model		: 2 model name	: Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.06GHz stepping	: 7 cpu MHz		: 3066.576 cache size	: 512 KB fdiv_bug	: no hlt_bug		: no f00f_bug	: no coma_bug	: no fpu		: yes fpu_exception	: yes cpuid level	: 2 wp		: yes flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm bogomips	: 6094.84 ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Martin Mokrejš    2004-02-08 14:48:01 UTC  ``` Are you sure you compiled mozilla with those CFLAGS? Mozilla overrides CFLAGS as it has hardcoded some options. Follow <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232748> . ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Aron Griffis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-25 17:15:19 UTC  ``` I work on the mozilla ebuilds but don't have pentium4 expertise.  I'll ask somebody in Gentoo who does to comment on this bug ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Aron Griffis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-25 17:20:03 UTC  ``` Sounds like we need a has_version test for the broken versions of gcc for pentium4 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Aron Griffis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-04-26 15:39:01 UTC  ``` Fixed in mozilla-1.7_rc1 and mozilla-firefox-0.8-r3 ... I don't think this is worth bothering to change in mozilla-1.6.  Thanks! ``` |  |
