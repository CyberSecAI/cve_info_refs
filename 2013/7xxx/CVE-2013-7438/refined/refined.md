Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2013-7438:

**CVE-2013-7438** is associated with two distinct vulnerabilities in `pbm2l2030`, a filter that converts Portable Bitmap Format (PBM) image data to the printer language of Lexmark 2030 printers. These vulnerabilities are tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla as:

*   **Bug 908430:** Heap-based buffer overflow
*   **Bug 908432:** Stack-based buffer overflow

**1. Heap-based buffer overflow (Bug 908430):**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way `pbm2l2030` creates its internal intermediate heap-based buffer when processing a PBM image file for printing.
*   **Weakness:** The code doesn't properly handle the size of the input PBM data, leading to a buffer overflow when generating the intermediate buffer on the heap.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can cause a crash of the `pbm2l2030` executable by providing a specially crafted PBM image file.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a malicious PBM image file through the pbm2l2030 filter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted PBM file to be processed by the vulnerable software.

**2. Stack-based buffer overflow (Bug 908432):**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the reading of PBM stream line data during image printing/conversion within `pbm2l2030`.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when reading PBM data into a stack-based buffer.
*  **Impact:**
    *   A remote attacker can cause a crash of the `pbm2l2030` executable.
    *   Potentially, this vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running `pbm2l2030`.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted PBM image file through the `pbm2l2030` filter.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted PBM file to be processed by the vulnerable software.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (and likely earlier)
*   Fedora releases 16, 17, and 18 (and likely earlier)

Both bugs were discovered by Murray McAllister of the Red Hat Security Response Team. They are marked as "CLOSED WONTFIX", indicating that Red Hat decided not to fix them, possibly because the package was not actively maintained.
