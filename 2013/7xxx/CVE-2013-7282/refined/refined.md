Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure implementation of authentication in the remote management web interface of Nisuta NS-WIR150NE and NS-WIR300N wireless routers.  Instead of properly verifying user credentials, the routers rely on a hardcoded, easily reproducible cookie (`admin:language=en`) to grant access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the password-based authentication mechanism completely. The routers set a static cookie after a successful login, which can then be used by an attacker to gain access without needing the password.
*   **Hardcoded Cookie:** The use of a hardcoded cookie for authentication is inherently insecure, as it is easily discoverable and reusable.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** The remote management web interface operates over HTTP without encryption, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and further attacks. This is also explicitly noted as an additional issue even if this vulnerability is fixed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Device Control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control of the vulnerable router's management interface. This allows them to:
    *   Change configurations
    *   Obtain sensitive information like the current remote management password
    *   Potentially modify DNS settings and other network parameters, leading to further attacks
    *   Perform any action available via the web interface.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can download the router's configuration file, which contains the management interface password and other sensitive data in clear text.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attack can be performed remotely from both the LAN and WAN interfaces, although remote management on the WAN interface is disabled by default. The LAN interface has remote management enabled by default and is thus more likely to be targeted in an attack.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack is carried out by sending an HTTP request with the insecure cookie, allowing unauthenticated access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the router, either from the LAN or WAN side.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request and insert a cookie in order to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Credentials Needed:** The attacker does not require any prior knowledge of the router's password or user credentials to bypass authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit demonstrates how to download the router's configuration file by setting the `Cookie: :language=en` header.
*   The advisory also notes the vendor's fix is not optimal, and that even after applying the fix the interface is still insecure due to the use of HTTP.
* The vendor provided firmware updates for the affected models, but disabling remote management on the WAN is advised as a temporary workaround.
