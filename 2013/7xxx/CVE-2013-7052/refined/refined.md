Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7052:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insecure handling of credentials within the D-Link DIR-100 router's firmware. Specifically, the administrator password and other sensitive configuration parameters are stored and accessible without proper protection. This lack of secure credential management allows an attacker to retrieve this information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **CWE-255: Issues with Credential Management:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of protection for the administrator password. It's directly accessible through the `cliget.cgi` script without requiring any authentication.
- **Weak Authentication:** Although not the main focus of CVE-2013-7052, the report highlights a weak authentication scheme where access to the `cli.cgi` script is only checked by matching the IP address, which allows an attacker to bypass the login procedure after a user authenticates from the same IP
- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability also extends to the exposure of other sensitive information, such as PPTP/PPPoE usernames and passwords, DynDNS credentials, and mail log credentials, all accessible without authentication through the `cliget.cgi` script.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain full administrative access to the router by retrieving the administrator password.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive configuration data, including internet connection credentials and other passwords, can be exposed, potentially leading to further attacks on the user's network and accounts.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  The combination of authentication bypass and information disclosure could lead to complete control over the router by an attacker.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Unauthenticated HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the router's web interface (specifically to the `cliget.cgi` script), without needing to log in.
- **Local Network:** An attacker needs to be on the same local network or have remote access to the web interface (if enabled).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs network connectivity to the D-Link DIR-100 router (either locally or through the internet if remote access is enabled).
- No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability and retrieve the sensitive information
