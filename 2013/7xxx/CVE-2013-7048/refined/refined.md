{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The temporary directory used to store live snapshots was created with world-writable permissions (777).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure directory permissions. The temporary directory for live snapshots was made world-writable, allowing any local user to read or modify the snapshot contents.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could read and modify live snapshot contents before they were uploaded to the image service, leading to potential information disclosure and data manipulation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the compute node.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs shell access on the compute node where the Nova service is running."
