Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-3710:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the use of a default secret key from git within the SLMS (SUSE Lifecycle Management Server) software. This default key, if not replaced, can be easily obtained because it was committed to a public repository.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The primary vulnerability is using a hardcoded default secret key that was committed to the source code repository (git). This makes the key widely available.
- **Insufficient File Permissions:** The security update also addresses file permissions related to the keys, ensuring these files are only readable by the SLMS process, preventing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is not explicitly described in detail within the provided content, but the use of a secret key generally implies this key is used for cryptographic operations. Therefore, an attacker with the knowledge of the default secret key could potentially perform unauthorized actions, such as:
   - **Authentication Bypass:** The key could be used to impersonate the system or other users.
    - **Data tampering/disclosure:** The key could be used to decrypt or manipulate data.
    - **Access to privileged functionality:** The key could be used to perform privileged actions without authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access to Code Repository:** An attacker could directly obtain the default secret key by examining the public git repository where the SLMS software was hosted/developed.
- **File System Access (Secondary):** If the file containing the key is not secured through file permissions, an attacker with access to the file system may read the key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Default Key:** The attacker needs knowledge of the default secret key, which could be obtained from the git repository.
- **Network access** An attacker may not need file system access to exploit the key. The impact of the vulnerability seems to revolve around the key's usage within the SLMS system itself.

**Additional Notes:**
- The update addresses the issue by ensuring a new secret key is generated if the default one is detected and by correcting file permissions.
- This vulnerability is marked with a "low" rating, which is surprising given its nature, however, this is based on the CVSS score of the issue.
- The provided content includes bugzilla links. These could provide more insight into the specific details of the vulnerability.
