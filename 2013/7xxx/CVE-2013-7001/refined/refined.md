The provided content is related to CVE-2013-7001.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is related to handling of corrupt MMS messages. There are two distinct denial of service (DoS) issues fixed in the 2013.11.15 update:
1.  A vulnerability introduced in the 2013.09.26 release, triggered by corrupt messages received via MM4.
2.  A vulnerability that affects all previous versions of NowSMS, triggered by a corrupt MM1 message that is routed externally via MM4 or MM7.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of corrupt MMS messages.
- Inadequate input validation leading to a denial-of-service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). The vulnerabilities cause the NowSMS service to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted, corrupt MMS message.
- The corrupt messages can be received through the MM4 or MM1 protocols.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the capability to send malformed MMS messages to a vulnerable NowSMS server.
- For one of the vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit an MM1 message submission to cause the denial of service when the message is routed externally via MM4 or MM7.
