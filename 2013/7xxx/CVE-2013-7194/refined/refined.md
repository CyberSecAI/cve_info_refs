      "content": "The eFront application version 3.6.14 (build 18012) is vulnerable to multiple persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The 'Last name' field when creating a new user, 'Lesson name' when creating a new lesson, and 'Course name' when creating a new course, are all vulnerable to stored XSS.\n\nRoot cause: Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.\n\nWeaknesses: The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs within the 'Last name', 'Lession name', and 'Course name' fields, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.\n\nImpact: Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could result in account compromise, session hijacking, or other malicious activities on behalf of the user interacting with the vulnerable fields.\n\nAttack vectors: An attacker can exploit this by creating a new user, lesson, or course and injecting a malicious JavaScript payload in the affected fields.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs an administrator account to create users, lessons and courses. The attacker needs to be able to interact with the user creation/lesson creation/course creation functionality of the eFront application."
