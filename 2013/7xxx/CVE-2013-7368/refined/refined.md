Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in Gnew v2013.1:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary issue is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. This allows attackers to inject malicious code into SQL queries and also to inject HTML/script code into the browser sessions of users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Input passed through parameters (specifically `news_id` via POST to `news/send.php`) is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **SQL Injection:** Input passed through parameters (specifically `news_id` via POST to `news/send.php`) is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code, including blind SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of System Information:** SQL Injection can lead to the exposure of sensitive database information.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The database could contain sensitive information which could be extracted via SQL Injection.
*   **Manipulation of Data:** SQL Injection can allow an attacker to manipulate data stored in the database.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting:** XSS can lead to the execution of malicious scripts within a user's browser session, which could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or data theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST requests:** Both XSS and SQL Injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by sending crafted POST requests to the `/news/send.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters (`news_id`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The `news_id` parameter is used to inject malicious code for both XSS and SQL Injection.
*   A blind SQL injection was demonstrated using `news_id='+(SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT SLEEP(25))A)+'`
*   The vendor has released an update (version 2016.1) to address these issues.
* Multiple references are available, including exploits and vulnerability advisories.
