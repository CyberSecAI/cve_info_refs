The provided content is related to CVE-2013-7308. However, this CVE ID is a placeholder. The content corresponds to the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-0149 (mentioned in the text). The vulnerability is present in the OSPF protocol and is described below:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The OSPF protocol does not enforce matching of the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields in Link State Advertisements (LSAs). During routing table calculation, implementations query LSAs using only the Link State ID. This discrepancy allows an attacker to inject malicious LSAs with a different Router ID, potentially overwriting valid routes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The OSPF protocol specification lacks sufficient validation of LSA identifiers. Specifically, it does not require the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields to match.
- The routing table calculation process relies solely on the 'Link State ID' to query the LSA database, making it vulnerable to LSA spoofing.
- Insecure implementation-specific behavior that allows malformed duplicate entries can cause unexpected results.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can subvert the routing table of a victim router by sending false LSAs.
- This subversion can lead to:
   - Denial of service (DoS) by causing the victim router to drop the entire routing table.
   - Traffic rerouting, potentially compromising data confidentiality.
   - Blackholing traffic

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have control of a router within the same Autonomous System (AS).
- The attacker sends crafted illegal OSPF Router LSAs (type-1), where the 'Link State ID' and 'Router ID' do not match.
- The crafted LSA must originate from an IP address of a legitimate OSPF peer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have control of a router within the targeted AS.
- The attacker must be able to send OSPF packets to the target router.
- The attacker needs to be able to spoof the source IP address of an OSPF peer.
