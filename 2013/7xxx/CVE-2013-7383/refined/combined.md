Everyone, please upgrade your X2Go Server installations."  I just added x2goserver-4.0.1.10 to tree, it works fine with stable x2goclient and libssh (and openssh[-hpn] on the server), so it can be stabled to fix this vulnerability ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-01-06 12:46:54 UTC  ``` Thanks for the report ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Bernard Cafarelli   gentoo-dev  2014-01-06 18:04:15 UTC  ``` 4.0.1.10 fixed the vulnerability but introduced a small bug when session ID strings contained dot characters.  So arches please test and mark stable =net-misc/x2goserver-4.0.1.11 instead, thanks! ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Bernard Cafarelli   gentoo-dev  2014-01-09 16:24:45 UTC  ``` Another hotfix release (this time for remote printing) came, so I removed the previous stable candidates. Sorry for the noise  Arches, new stable target is =net-misc/x2goserver-4.0.1.12 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Pacho Ramos   gentoo-dev  2014-01-12 16:57:10 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Paweł Hajdan, Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2014-01-21 00:43:43 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Bernard Cafarelli   gentoo-dev  2014-03-03 16:41:14 UTC  ``` Vulnerable versions removed from tree ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2014-03-04 17:29:59 UTC  ``` Maintainers and Arches thank you for your work.

Subject: CVE request: X2Go Server privilege escalation

Hello,
I don't see a CVE assigned for the vulnerability announced here:
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.terminal-server.x2go.announce/83>
It appears that this is a privilege escalation through injecting
backticks, but I'm not absolutely sure. It is fixed as of versions
4.0.1.10/4.0.0.8 in the following commits:
<http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=x2goserver.git;a=commit;h=5a2aa0c36ef7a57d87e3bb6f7c6b2558ed5430f7>
<http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=x2goserver.git;a=commit;h=5a2aa0c36ef7a57d87e3bb6f7c6b2558ed5430f7>
<http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=x2goserver.git;a=commit;h=8347d3fef0e5cbabe4aa48f503612fa7b9d078f8>
<http://code.x2go.org/gitweb?p=x2goserver.git;a=commit;h=bf44925ecccda436caa1cfc34f89eced9c1bd104>

Could a CVE be assigned?

Thanks,
Chris Reffett
