Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2013-7081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the (old) Form Content Element's ability to generate arbitrary signatures (HMACs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary issue is the ability of editors with access to the old form content element to generate arbitrary HMAC signatures.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The arbitrary signatures could potentially be used in contexts where the editor should not have access, potentially leading to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could exploit the ability to generate arbitrary signatures in contexts beyond the intended access level of the editor which could lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker needs to have access to the TYPO3 backend with permission to use the old form content element.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated backend user with editor privileges and access to the old form content element.

**Additional Notes**
*   The old form content element is used when the TYPO3 extension "form" is not active.
* The vulnerability was fixed by changing the signature generation to prevent usage in different contexts.
