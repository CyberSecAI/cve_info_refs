          MobileIron Multiple Products
       Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

Advisory ID: MATTA-2013-004
CVE reference: CVE-2014-1409, CVE-2013-7286
Affected platforms: VSP and Sentry
Version: VSP < 5.9.1 and Sentry < 5.0
Date: 2013-December-19
Security risk: Critical
Researcher: Nico Leidecker
Vendor Status: Patch released
Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:

=====================================================================
Description:

During an external penetration test exercise for one of our clients,
 an authentication bypass vulnerability was found in the
 administrative interface of a MobileIron deployment. This ultimately
 allowed us to, gain access to our client's internal network.

The 'j_username' parameter of the script at
https://<target>/mics/j_spring_security_check is vulnerable to blind
 XPath Injection, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve the
 underlying XML document.

This XML document is an excerpt of the configuration file of the
 device. It contains obfuscated passwords and, depending on
 configuration, might contain domain credentials and allow the
 attacker to reposition both internally and on any of the attached
 devices.
 This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2014-1409.

The password obfuscation algorithm is known and has already been
 documented [1]... AES-ECB-PKCS1.5 with a known, shared key. While we
 won't release a full-featured exploit for the vulnerability, we will
 release a PoC to confirm whether the hashes are indeed vulnerable.
 The vendor has confirmed that a stronger encryption method is used
 since release 5.7.
 This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2013-7286.

[1]
<https://www.hackinparis.com/sites/hackinparis.com/files/MDM-HIP_2013.pdf>
NB: A second insecure encryption scheme is described in [1], MITRE has
 assigned CVE-2013-7287 to that separate vulnerability.

=====================================================================
Impact

Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to take
 over the device and potentially any device attached to it as well
 as the Active Directory Domain it might be linked to.

=====================================================================
Versions affected:

- - Sentry Standalone < 5
- - VSP < 5.9.1

=====================================================================
Workaround:

Restrict access to the MICS service (administrative interface) to
 specific hosts:

### VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Cost-effective Security Assessments Managed by our senior security consultants.**

External Vulnerability Scanning is a crucial part of every security programme. However, budgets do not always allow for the cost of an extensive consultancy-based Penetration Test.

Cost-effective automated scanners go some way to resolving this issue, but the limitations of automated systems are well-documented and understood. The reports produced contain multiple false positives, and it becomes the responsibility of the client to work through the issues to determine the real issues from the false ones. On a typical external network of 64 IP addresses, this can take between one and three full-time days for someone will the skills and up-to-date knowledge to perform.

![image](img2/penetration+testing.png)
### Penetration TESTING

Which Penetration Test is Right for You? Penetration Testing can include so many different elements, that the first challenge is first deciding what tests should be commissioned.

Matta has advisors, which can help you scope the requirements based on your objectives, budget and timescale. In a perfect world all the requirements can be met with the existing budget you had in mind. If this is not possible, however, we can suggest ways to gain the most benefit, and prioritise activities.

External Penetration Test Conducting a penetration test on the public facing network is something most companies should consider doing at least annually. Apart from the obvious reasons of good compliance, it is important to supplement any VA work you may be doing with a full consultant based Penetration Test to ensure that your network is truly as robust as you think it may be from an attacker.

![image](img2/emergency+response.png)
### Emergency response

**A security breach can have cause a hugely detrimental impact on your company, including reputation damage, loss of business, and unplanned downtime.**

Mattaâs incident response service comprises of a multi-disciplined and experienced incident response team that use their experience, so that you can get your business back up and running as quickly as possible.

Getting early notification of an incident helps Matta in working with you to determine an appropriate response.

Matta can help you determine the steps you need to take to preserve any audit trail and, if required, preserve and prepare the environment for evidences to be admissible in court.
