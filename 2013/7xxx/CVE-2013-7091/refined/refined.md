Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-7091

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) in the `/res/I18nMsg,AjxMsg,ZMsg,ZmMsg,AjxKeys,ZmKeys,ZdMsg,Ajx%20TemplateMsg.js.zgz` file within Zimbra Collaboration Server. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `skin` parameter of the affected file, allowing traversal to access local files outside of the intended webroot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files, such as `localconfig.xml`, which contains LDAP root credentials.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to the LDAP credentials, an attacker can make requests to the `/service/admin/soap` API. This allows the attacker to create new administrative users, gaining access to the Zimbra Administration Console.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Through the admin interface, an attacker can upload a malicious file via the client uploader and execute it to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable file, using a `skin` parameter containing a directory traversal payload and a null byte to truncate the path.
*   **Exploitation Chain:** The full exploit involves chaining the LFI to read credentials, then using those credentials to obtain an admin session, then finally exploiting the file upload function to achieve code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Zimbra server.
*   **No Authentication Required for Initial LFI:** The initial LFI vulnerability does not require any prior authentication.
*   **Admin Console Port Open:** For the full exploit to work (privilege escalation and RCE), the admin console port (typically 7071) must be open.

**Additional Details (from Exploit-DB entries):**
*   The vulnerability affects Zimbra versions 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and early 2013, specifically tested on Zimbra Collaboration Server 7.2.2 and 8.0.2
*   A Metasploit module is available for exploiting this vulnerability.
*   The exploit uses the LFI to get the LDAP credentials from `localconfig.xml`, then uses the credentials in SOAP request to create an auth token.
*   After getting the admin access, the attacker uploads a JSP stager (that executes a provided payload) via the client uploader functionality, to get RCE.
