How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MyBB 1.6.12 Released – Security & Maintenance Release

Posted on [December 16, 2013](https://blog.mybb.com/2013/12/16/mybb-1-6-12-released-security-maintenance-release/ "2:35 pm")  by  [StefanT](https://blog.mybb.com/author/stefanmybb/ "View all posts by StefanT")

MyBB 1.6.12 is now available from the MyBB website and is a security and maintenance release.

#### What’s added/changed in this version?

This release fixes **4 vulnerabilities** and **10 reported issues** causing incorrect functionality of MyBB. Please be aware that to be able to provide easy to manage updates not all issues have been fixed in this version.

* Vulnerabilities:
  + Medium Risk: A SQL vulnerability when editing smilies in ACP – reported by [ChALkeR](http://community.mybb.com/user-79003.html)
  + Medium Risk: A SQL vulnerability when deleting posts with Akismet in ACP – reported by [ChALkeR](http://community.mybb.com/user-79003.html)
  + Medium Risk: A XSS vulnerability in video MyCode – reported by [ChALkeR](http://community.mybb.com/user-79003.html)
  + Low Risk: A XSS vulnerability in smilie popup – reported by [Spenzert](http://community.mybb.com/user-78283.html)
* Bugs fixed:
  + MyCode parser adds new lines since 1.6.11
  + Some plugins throwing errors due to usage of unsupported language file calls since 1.6.11
  + Uploading attachments may fail when safe mode is enabled
  + Promotion task option “weeks” doesn’t work properly
  + Issue with queries not being executed in the correct order on logout
  + [#2196 Thread Prefix altered via Tamper Data](http://dev.mybb.com/issues/2196)
  + [#2251 Reputation doesn’t carry over when merging users](http://dev.mybb.com/issues/2251)
  + [#2267 See other’s posts in a “see own post forum” through archive](http://dev.mybb.com/issues/2267)
  + [#2275 Mod Log error when posting new thread](http://dev.mybb.com/issues/2275)
  + **Adding support for 4-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding in MySQL**When MySQL 5.5.3 or above is used a new option to convert the tables to 4-Byte UTF-8 Unicode Encoding is available in the “UTF-8 Conversion” page in the Admin Control Panel. This allows to store unicode characters with 4 bytes. If you don’t know what we are talking about you probably don’t need it. PgSQL and SQLite can store such characters by default.

Information on upgrading, template changes and language changes can be found [on the Docs site](http://docs.mybb.com/1612.html).

**Please note, that you do not need to run the upgrade script for this version.**

*There are **no** database schema changes in this version.*

#### Upgrading from 1.6.11 and Other Versions

Before performing any upgrade please remember to backup your forum’s files and database and store them safely. If you have edited core files, including language files, please make sure you make a changelog for these changes so you can make them again (if necessary) once the upgrade is complete.

To upgrade, follow the Upgrading process. The **upgrade script** is not required. There are changes to 2 language files. No templates have been changed or added.

#### Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities

If you think you’ve found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we’ve had time to prepare and release a patch.

As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the [Contact Us](http://www.mybb.com/contact) page or in our [Private Inquiries](http://community.mybb.com/forum-135.html) forum – where you can start a new thread that only you and the MyBB Team can see.

Thanks,

MyBB Team

   Did anyone fix the LOWER sql search on usernames logging in yet? It means it doesn’t use the index and causes 100% cpu issues on larger sites when spam bots try to login. There is no need for that query to be case sensitive as far as I’m aware

    I applied the changed files to a 1.6.11 installation, but got an error saying that the board needed to be updated when trying to visit my forum or the ACP. After running the upgrade script (which was announced as not being necessary), I no longer get that error.

      You have probably missed to run the upgrade script on a previous release.

    Ugh, I was using 1.6.11 and used the changed files package, but MyBB still thinks it’s 1.6.11. The admin control panel keeps telling me I need to upgrade.

        I was afraid someone would say that. Just to be sure, I unpacked the files to the proper directory for a third and fourth time. MyBB still indicates that it is 1.6.11 and the control panel indicates that there is still a newer version.

    Hi there,

    silly question, upgrading from 1.6.8 do I need to run the script or not? Reading comment 14 it looks as if I might have to.

    If that is NOT the case, then all I have to do is copy the files as points 2, 3 and 4, as described here

    <http://docs.mybb.com/Upgrading.html#Beginning_the_Upgrade>, do not apply this time. Is that so?

    Sorry for the dumb questions, but better be safe than sorry 😀

      Yes, you have to run the upgrade script when you are not upgrading from 1.6.11.
