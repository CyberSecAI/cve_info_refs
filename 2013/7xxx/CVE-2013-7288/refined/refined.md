Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2013-7288:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the video MyCode functionality of MyBB. Specifically, the issue lies within the `inc/class_parser.php` file, where the domain of a video URL is parsed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code was not properly sanitizing the video URL's domain, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious code via the domain name. The original code used `$local = $domain[0].'.';`, which is vulnerable. The fix implemented is using ` $local = htmlspecialchars_uni($domain[0]).'.';` to sanitize the domain.
- Unsanitized input allows for injection of malicious scripts when parsing a video URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the video MyCode, potentially leading to actions such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted video URL, specifically manipulating the domain part of the URL, which is then processed by the vulnerable `mycode_parse_video` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to post content (e.g., a forum post, private message) that includes the crafted video MyCode.
- No special privileges are required beyond the ability to post content.
