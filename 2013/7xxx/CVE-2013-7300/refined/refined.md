Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-7300:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Cantata music player has an internal HTTP server that does not properly restrict access to files. This allows an attacker to access any file on the system that the Cantata process has permissions to read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Absolute Path Traversal:** The HTTP server does not validate or sanitize file paths requested by clients. This allows an attacker to request arbitrary files on the system using absolute paths in the HTTP request.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The HTTP server lacks proper authentication or access control mechanisms, which allows unauthorized users to access the service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read any file the Cantata process has access to, potentially including sensitive information such as SSH keys, password files, and personal documents.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker can send an HTTP request to the vulnerable Cantata server over the network.
*   **Local Access:**  A local user on the same system as Cantata can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the machine running the vulnerable Cantata instance, or be a local user on the system.
*   The attacker needs to know the port the HTTP server is listening on.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content specifies that this vulnerability was addressed by assigning CVE-2013-7300 for the lack of restrictions and an absolute path traversal, while CVE-2013-7301 was assigned for the default configuration using an external interface without access control.
*   The HTTP server is enabled by default in Cantata, which increases the attack surface.
*  The exploit can be triggered using tools like `wget`, demonstrating the ease of exploitation.
