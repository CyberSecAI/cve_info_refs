Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7401:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `parse_request()` function within the `request.c` file of the c-icap server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A flaw exists in the parsing logic of ICAP requests. If an incoming request buffer does not contain a space (" ") or a question mark ("?"), the function's internal pointer (`end` pointer) can increment beyond the allocated buffer's memory boundaries, leading to a heap overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A remote attacker can send a specially crafted ICAP request to the c-icap server, triggering the out-of-bounds memory access. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the c-icap service to crash and become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is sending a crafted ICAP request that lacks the expected space or question mark delimiters in the request line.
- This can be achieved via the OPTIONS method or potentially other ICAP methods depending on the affected code paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the c-icap server. This generally implies a remote network access position to the targeted server.

**Additional Notes:**
-  The provided information indicates that the issue was discovered by Peter Berestov.
-  The fix for CVE-2013-7401 was backported into the 0.2.6 version.
-  CVE-2013-7402 refers to a different issue, fixed by commits r1018 and r1021.
