Package        : c-icap
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-7401 CVE-2013-7402

Several vulnerabilities were found in c-icap, an ICAP server
implementation, which could allow a remote attacker to cause c-icap to
crash, or have other, unspecified impacts.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.1.6-1.1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 1:0.3.1-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your c-icap packages.

Reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=14153#c1)  David Walser    2014-09-23 18:39:33 CEST  ``` According to the Gentoo bug, it actually wasn't yet fixed upstream in 0.2.6, they had backported an additional patch: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=455324>  So Mageia 4 would also be affected. ```  ---   Version: 3 => 4Whiteboard: (none) => MGA3TOO  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14153#c2)  David Walser    2014-10-03 23:38:54 CEST  ``` The patch Gentoo added only fixes CVE-2013-7401: <http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/net-proxy/c-icap/files/c-icap-0.2.6-fix-icap-parsing.patch?revision=1.1&view=markup>  CVE-2013-7402 is only fixed in 0.3.x, in these commits: <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/code/1018/> <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/code/1021/>  see this bug report for CVE-2013-7402: <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/bugs/59/>  I guess it could be updated to 0.3.x in Mageia 3 and Mageia 4 (and c-icap-modules-extra would need to be as well I would imagine).  If so, even Cauldron should be updated to the newest 0.3.4, as it contains a crasher fix: <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/news/>  Here's an osvdb advisory for CVE-2013-7401 and more info including a PoC: <http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/89304> <http://osvdb.org/ref/89/c-icap.txt> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=14153#c3)  David Walser    2014-12-13 22:12:24 CET  ``` Debian has issued an advisory for this on December 13: <https://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-3101>  Now I see that the two upstream commits that I linked in [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14153#c2) apply cleanly to 0.2.6 and fix both CVEs.  I guess I should have figured that out earlier...  Patched package uploaded for Mageia 4.  Removing Mageia 3 from the whiteboard due to EOL.  This package has been removed from Cauldron due to lack of response from the maintainer.

Use CVE-2013-7402 for the chtsanti discoveries, i.e., the other issues
in the pre-r1018 code that made a remote crash possible. This might,
for example, include attack vectors with invalid method names.

There is no CVE ID for the <http://sourceforge.net/p/c-icap/code/1021>
issue. This seems to be a usability problem that was introduced by the
first version of the security fixes.

# c-icap: Denial of service — GLSA **201409-07**

A vulnerability in c-icap could result in Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-proxy/c-icap** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.2.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.2.6** |

### Background

c-icap is an implementation of an ICAP server. It can be used with HTTP
proxies that support the ICAP protocol to implement content adaptation
and filtering services.

### Description

c-icap contains a flaw in the parse\_request() function of request.c that
may allow a remote denial of service. The issue is triggered when the
buffer fails to contain a ‘ ‘ or ‘?’ symbol, which will cause the
end pointer to increase and surpass allocated memory. With a specially
crafted request (e.g. via the OPTIONS method), a remote attacker can
cause a loss of availability for the program.

### Impact

A remote attacker may cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All c-icap users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/c-icap-0.2.6"

```
