Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-7324:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way WebKit-GTK handles audio volume control in conjunction with PulseAudio and GStreamer. Specifically, WebKit-GTK passes JavaScript-initiated volume changes directly to GStreamer, which in turn affects the PulseAudio stream volume. This allows malicious JavaScript code to bypass user-set volume controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Lack of Input Validation:** WebKit-GTK doesn't differentiate between user-initiated volume changes and those triggered by JavaScript.
-   **Trusting Client Requests:** PulseAudio's security model assumes clients will not send malicious requests to change stream volume. WebKit-GTK violates this assumption by passing on untrusted JS input.
-  **Default Flat-Volume Mode in PulseAudio:** The flat-volume mode in PulseAudio exacerbates the issue, allowing a malicious script to set volume at maximum, potentially causing damage or discomfort.
-  **Disobeying User Volume Controls:** Even with non-flat volumes, the JavaScript can reset the volume, making user-controlled volume sliders ineffective.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Unexpectedly High Sound Volume:** A malicious website can cause the user's audio to play at an unexpectedly high volume, potentially damaging speakers or the user's hearing.
-   **Bypassing User Controls:** Users are unable to control or mute the volume of the affected audio stream using standard desktop volume controls.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Network:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by embedding malicious JavaScript in a web page.
-   **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit a malicious website to trigger the vulnerability, though no direct interaction aside from browsing is necessary to be exposed to it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Remote attacker:** The attacker must be able to host a webpage with the malicious Javascript.
-   **Ability to embed malicious JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to write Javascript code that interacts with the HTML5 audio/video API to manipulate the volume.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in WebKit-GTK 2.x (or any version with HTML5 audio/video support based on GStreamer).
*   The WebKit-GTK behavior complies with existing W3C standards and GNOME desktop integration practices, indicating that the vulnerability is also a problem with the standard/practices.
*   The issue is more severe when PulseAudio's flat-volume mode is enabled (which is the default in most distributions, except Ubuntu).
*   The issue has been discussed in multiple mailing lists and bug trackers, as evidenced by the provided references.

This is a security issue that arises from the interaction of different components and a lack of proper validation of untrusted input, leading to a bypass of user controls and potential harm.
