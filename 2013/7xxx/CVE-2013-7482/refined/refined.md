While the changelog indicates multiple security fixes, it doesn't specify the exact nature of the vulnerability addressed by version 3.1.5, 3.1.4 or the other security related fixes mentioned.

Based on the changelog entries, here's what can be inferred:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The changelog indicates multiple security issues were found in the plugin, including a critical one in v3.1.4. The updates suggest issues with the prettyPhoto.js file and the sanitization of outputs leading to potential XSS vulnerabilities, a form submission issue, and a previous security exploit that had to be tightened. 
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Likely XSS vulnerabilities due to unsanitized output and potential injection issues with form submissions, and possibly issues in the included prettyPhoto.js library.  There was also a previous security exploit that was mitigated in multiple versions.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser. Other exploits could have lead to unauthorized data access or modifications.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacks could be carried out through crafted input or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the prettyPhoto.js library.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code or exploit flaws in the plugin or included javascript libraries, which could range from being a malicious authenticated user to sending malformed requests to the plugin.

It's important to note that the description of the fixes is vague.
