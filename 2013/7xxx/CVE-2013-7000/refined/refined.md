Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability information:

**Summary:**

The provided content refers to a security update for NowSMS/NowMMS, specifically version 2013.11.15, which addresses two denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities and a bug related to MMS group message headers.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **DoS 1:** A corrupt message received via an MM4 connection. This vulnerability was introduced in the 2013.09.26 release.
    *   **DoS 2:** A corrupt MM1 message submission that was routed externally via MM4 or MM7. This issue affected all previous versions of NowSMS.
    *   **Header Issue:**  Loss or incomplete To/Cc recipient headers for MMS group messages received via an MM4 interconnect.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The software is susceptible to crashing or becoming unresponsive when processing specially crafted/corrupted MMS messages, impacting the availability of the service.
    *   **Data Integrity:** The MMS message header issue leads to data loss/corruption related to message recipients.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **DoS:**  Could cause the NowSMS/NowMMS service to become unavailable.
    *   **Header Issue:** Loss of information about the intended recipients of a message, potentially leading to miscommunication, privacy issues, or operational errors.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **MM4 Connection:** Sending a corrupt message via an MM4 connection to trigger the first DoS vulnerability.
    *   **MM1 Submission (routed via MM4 or MM7):** Submitting a corrupt MM1 message that is subsequently routed via MM4 or MM7 to trigger the second DoS vulnerability.
    *  **MM4 Interconnect:** Sending a MMS group message via an MM4 interconnect to trigger the header issue.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send or manipulate MMS messages that are processed by the NowSMS/NowMMS server. This would require access to the MMS network and understanding of message formats.

**Additional Details (from the content):**

*   The update (2013.11.15) addresses these issues and provides improved recovery handling for unexpected problems.
*   A link to the change log (`https://nowsms.com/download/changes.txt`) is provided for further information.
*   The content highlights the critical nature of the update for users of the MMSC functionality.
