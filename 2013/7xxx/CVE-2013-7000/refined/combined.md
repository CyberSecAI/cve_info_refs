# NowSMS / NowMMS Update 2013.11.15

Posted by [brett](https://nowsms.com/author/mobileduc "Posts by brett") on Nov 18, 2013 in [Software Updates](https://nowsms.com/category/updates), [Support Blog](https://nowsms.com/category/supportblog)

[Home](https://nowsms.com) » [Software Updates](https://nowsms.com/category/updates) » NowSMS / NowMMS Update 2013.11.15

An updated release of NowSMS is now available for download. Version 2013.11.15 is a critical update for customers using MMSC functionality.

This update fixes two different denial of service problems and improves recovery handling of unexpected problems. One problem was new to the 2013.09.26 release and can be triggered by a corrupt message received via an MM4 connection. The other problem affects all previous versions of NowSMS and can be triggered by a corrupt MM1 message submission that is to be routed externally via MM4 or MM7.

This release also corrects a problem where some To/Cc recipient headers were lost or incomplete for MMS group messages received via an MM4 interconnect.

Additional details on this release can be found in our changes log at <https://nowsms.com/download/changes.txt>.

For a summary of major new features introduced in recent releases, please see <https://nowsms.com/nowsms2013>.

The trial version download can be used to update an existing installation: <https://nowsms.com/download-free-trial>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
