Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-7393

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of pid files by the `svnwcsub.py` and `irkerbridge.py` utility daemons within Subversion. These scripts use a `--pidfile` option to create a file containing their process ID. However, they don't verify if the specified file is a symlink.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** The core issue is that if an unprivileged user can write to the directory where the pidfile is created, they can replace it with a symlink. When the vulnerable program attempts to write its process ID to the pid file, it could instead overwrite a file pointed to by the symlink with the PID. This can lead to arbitrary file write.
*   **Insecure pid file creation:** `daemonize.py`, used by the scripts, doesn't ensure that the pid file is created exclusively, leaving it vulnerable to symlink attacks. Additionally, `svnwcsub.py`, when run in foreground mode, has its own insecure pid file creation implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the symlink, an attacker can cause the vulnerable program to write its PID to a file that the attacker doesn't normally have access to. Depending on the chosen target file, this can potentially lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** If the pid file is replaced with a symlink while the service is running, a script attempting to stop the service might kill the wrong process, leading to disruption. Additionally, a file in one of the managed working copies or in their metadata (.svn) areas may be truncated and replaced with single line containing a pid number which can lead to data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system where the vulnerable scripts are running.
*   **Writable Directory:** The pid file must be located in a directory where unprivileged users have write access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the machine running the vulnerable Subversion tools.
*   The attacker must have write permissions to the directory where the pid file is located or is going to be created.
*   The vulnerable scripts (`svnwcsub.py`, `irkerbridge.py`) must be used with the `--pidfile` option.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable tools are optional and not installed by default.
*   The default configuration of Subversion places the pid files in directories not writable by unprivileged users.
*   The provided patch fixes this issue by using `os.open` with the `os.O_EXCL` flag to ensure the file is created exclusively and prevents symlink attacks.
