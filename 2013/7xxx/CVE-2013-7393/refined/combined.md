# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016

=== Content from subversion.apache.org_cf44ed0e_20250125_161904.html ===
 The admin-side optional utility daemons svnwcsub.py and irkerbridge.py are
vulnerable to a local privilege escalation vulnerability via symlink attack.
Summary:
========
svnwcsub.py and irkerbridge.py take a --pidfile option which creates
a file containing the process id they are running as. Both of them
do not take steps to ensure that the file they have been directed at
is not a symlink. If the pid file is in a directory writeable by
unprivileged users, the destination could be replaced by a symlink
allowing for privilege escalation. Both are optional extra tools
that are not installed by default and do not create a pid file by
default.
Known vulnerable:
=================
svnwcsub.py and irkerbridge.py included with Subversion 1.8.0 - 1.8.1, when
--pidfile is passed, due to an underlying problem in daemonize.py.
svnwcsub.py included with Subversion 1.8.0 - 1.8.2 when run in
foreground mode (as opposed to daemon mode) when --pidfile is
passed.
Known fixed:
============
daemonize.py included with Subversion 1.8.2 or newer.
svnwcsub.py included with Subversion 1.8.3.
Subversion 1.7.x and earlier do not include these files and are not
vulnerable.
Details:
========
The pid file is often used by scripts to be able to determine if a specific
service is running and to determine which process to kill to stop a service.
If the pid file is created in a directory writable by unprivileged
directories, they could replace it with a symlink.
If that is done while the service is stopped, the service may overwrite the
target of the symlink with a one line containing its pid when it starts.
This may lead to privilege escalation, depending on the target of the
symlink.
If that is done while the service is running, the stop script may
kill the wrong process. In effect the unprivileged user would be able to
kill a process they do not have permissions to kill when a privileged script
depends on the pid file.
Both svnwcsub.py and irkerbridge.py use the daemonize.py module to help
implement the pidfile feature. This module does not properly ensure that
the pid file is being created new every time and as such are vulnerable.
The daemonize.py script has been fixed to resolve this issue and the fixed
version is included in Subversion 1.8.2.
svnwcsub.py also supports the --pidfile option when running in the
foreground and does not depend upon the daemonize.py module to support that
functionality. The foreground implementation of --pidfile is also
vulnerable.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv2 Base Score: 2.4
CVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:L/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P
We consider this to be a low risk vulnerability.
The tools are not installed by default so most installations are not likely
to be vulnerable.
Unless the pid file is created in a directory with permissions for
unprivileged users the vulnerability cannot be exploited. The init scripts
provided with Subversion places the pid file in /var/run or a subdirectory
under /var/run, which is not typically writable by unprivileged users.
The svnwcsub and irkerbridge services do not run as root by default and so
the potential privilege escalation is limited. In svnwcsub, a file in one
of the managed working copies or in their metadata (.svn) areas may be
truncated and replaced with single line containing a pid number.
The attacker would need to have local access to the machine that the tools
were running on in order to exploit the vulnerability.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend that users using svnwcsub.py and irkerbridge.py upgrade their
installations with the files (including daemonize.py) as included in
Subversion 1.8.3 or newer.
Administrators can mitigate the vulnerability without upgrading by refraining
from pointing the pid file at a directory where unprivileged users have write
access (e.g. /tmp). Instead the pidfile should be placed in a directory
where only the daemon has access to create, modify, and delete files.
Alternatively, the pid file may be disabled altogether by removing the
--pidfile option from the invocation.
