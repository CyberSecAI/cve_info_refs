{
  "cveId": "CVE-2013-7268",
  "description": "An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability occurs due to improperly initialized `msg_name` and `msg_namelen` message header parameters within the `recvfrom`, `recvmmsg`, and `recvmsg` system calls when used with IPX protocol sockets in the Linux kernel.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Leakage",
        "Improper Initialization"
      ],
      "impact": "An unprivileged local user can exploit the vulnerability to leak potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Local access to the system."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": [
        "Ability to execute system calls such as `recvfrom`, `recvmmsg`, or `recvmsg`."
      ],
      "notes": "The vulnerability exists in the IPX protocol socket implementation within the Linux Kernel. Specifically the issue is triggered when these system calls are used with IPX protocol sockets. This allows a local, unprivileged user to extract information from the kernel stack."
