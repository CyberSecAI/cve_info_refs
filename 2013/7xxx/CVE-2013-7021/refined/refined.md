Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7021:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2013-7021. The CVE ID is explicitly mentioned within the text from openwall.com, along with a description that ties it to a commit fixing a double free in the fps filter:

```

    avfilter/vf_fps: make sure the fifo is not empty before using it
    fixes double free in the fps filter
    <https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/2905>
```

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `avfilter/vf_fps` filter within FFmpeg. Specifically, the code did not properly check if the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer was empty before attempting to use it. This oversight led to a double-free scenario.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

The primary vulnerability is a double free condition. This occurs when memory that has already been freed is attempted to be freed again, which can lead to memory corruption and program crashes. The immediate cause is dereferencing an invalid pointer within the filter.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The double-free could cause a crash of the application processing the video, thus causing a denial of service
   - **Potential Memory Corruption:** Double frees can sometimes be leveraged to corrupt memory, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, but this is not confirmed in the provided information.

**5. Attack Vectors**

The attack vector involves providing a crafted video file (specifically a .ts file) to the affected FFmpeg version with the vulnerable fps filter enabled. The specific command used to trigger the bug includes `-filter:v fps=fps=30`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

An attacker needs:
   - **Ability to provide input:** An attacker would need to provide the crafted input file to an FFmpeg instance for processing. This could be in the form of a malicous video uploaded to a service that utilizes FFmpeg or through some other means.
   - **No specialized priviledges:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an unprivileged user as long as they can control the parameters and input of the FFmpeg process.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was triggered with a specific command, `-i sample.ts -t 0.1 -filter:v fps=fps=30 -vcodec libx264 -b:v 2000000 -y out.ts` which indicates that use of the `fps` filter is required for exploitation.
- The issue was triggered using a multi-threaded decoding scenario, indicated by `Needs a high number of decoding threads (>2).` This implies that a certain amount of resources would be needed to reliably trigger this issue.
- The fix for this issue was introduced by the following commit:
```
<https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/cdd5df8189ff1537f7abe8defe971f80602cc2d2>
```
- The vulnerability was reported by Andrey Utkin and found via Valgrind.

In summary, CVE-2013-7021 represents a double-free vulnerability in the FFmpeg `fps` filter, triggered when the filter attempts to access a FIFO buffer that has already been freed which can cause a crash and potentially lead to a DoS attack. An attacker would need to craft a video file that uses the problematic filter to exploit this vulnerability.
