The provided content relates to CVE-2013-7464.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a bug in how the csrf-magic library handled secret keys. When a secret key was not explicitly set, the `csrf_hash()` function failed to use it, leading to a situation where CSRF tokens could be generated without the appropriate secret key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of secret keys
- CSRF vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could forge CSRF tokens, potentially leading to unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users.
- The risk was higher for users without cookies enabled.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could create malicious forms or links that, when clicked by a user, would send requests to the vulnerable application with forged CSRF tokens.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or submitting a crafted form.
