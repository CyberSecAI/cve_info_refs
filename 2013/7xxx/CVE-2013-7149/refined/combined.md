# Zero Day Vulnerability in OpenX Source 2.8.11 and Revive Adserver 3.0.1

* Post date

  [December 18, 2013](https://www.kreativrauschen.com/blog/2013/12/18/zero-day-vulnerability-in-openx-source-2-8-11-and-revive-adserver-3-0-1/)

The current versions of the popular ad server software OpenX Source (2.8.11) and Revive Adserver (3.0.1) are vulnerable a sql injection attack which allows attackers to gain backend access. The vulnerability is actively being exploited.

The OpenX team has been informed. For Revive, I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/revive-adserver/revive-adserver/pull/208) with a fix.

Since Revive Adserver is the official successor to OpenX Source, I assume that there will not be an updated version of OpenX Source (after all, there wasn’t one for the [last vulnerability](http://www.kreativrauschen.com/blog/2013/09/11/zero-day-vulnerability-in-openx-2-8-11/)). I have created a set of patched files which fix the vulnearbility in OpenX 2.8.11: [openx-2.8.11-sql-injection-patch.zip](http://www.kreativrauschen.com/blog/daten/openx-2.8.11-sql-injection-patch.zip). To patch Revive Adserver, use the files from [revive-3.0.1-sql-injection-patch.zip](http://www.kreativrauschen.com/blog/daten/revive-3.0.1-sql-injection-patch.zip).

I recommend applying the patches immediately, since the vulnerability is actively being exploited and has been for some time now.

*Update 19.12.*: The revive team confirmed the vulnerability and is working on a fixed version.

***Update 20.12.***: The Revive team released [Revive Adserver 3.0.2](http://www.revive-adserver.com/blog/revive-adserver-v3-0-2-released-important-security-fix/) which fixes the vulnerability. If possible, I recommend to update to this version as soon as possible (including users of OpenX). Thanks a lot to the team for the quick reaction!

The Revive team also suggest a quicker temporary fix for people who cannot update right away: Remove “www/delivery/axmlrpc.php” if you do not need xmlrpc delivery (most setups use different delivery methods).

***Update 3.2.2014***: Removing axmlrpc.php alone does not seem to be enough to fully protect an installation. dxmlrpc.php should be removed as well. Many thanks to Péter Veres for the discovery!

## By the way

If you are managing an OpenX Source or Revive Adserver installation, take a look at the [OpenX Maintenance Checklist](https://checkpanel.com/checklist-templates/openx-maintenance) or [Revive Adserver Maintenance Checklist](https://checkpanel.com/checklist-templates/revive-maintenance). It helps you keeping track of frequent maintenance tasks and security checks. If you sign up for an account at [Checkpanel](https://checkpanel.com) (not required) you can easily manage this checklist. You can see when you last checked each item, set reminders, work in teams and more. Checkpanel is not limited to OpenX/Revive checklists – it helps you managing all kinds of recurring tasks (see [some other samples](https://checkpanel.com/checklist-templates/) and [features](https://checkpanel.com/features)).

# Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2013-001

## Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2013-001

* Advisory ID: REVIVE-SA-2013-001
* CVE ID: CVE-2013-7149
* Date: 2013-12-20
* Security risk: Critical
* Applications affected: Revive Adserver
* Versions affected: <= 3.0.1
* Versions not affected: >= 3.0.2
* Website: [https://www.revive-adserver.com/](https://www.revive-adserver.com/ "Revive Adserver")

## Vulnerability: SQL injection

### Description

An SQL-injection vulnerability was recently discovered and reported to the Revive Adserver team by Florian Sander. The vulnerability is known to be already exploited to gain unauthorised access to the application using brute force mechanisms, however other kind of attacks might be possible and/or already in use. The risk is rated to be critical as the most common end goal of the attackers is to spread malware to the visitors of all the websites and ad networks that the ad server is being used on.

The vulnerability is also present and exploitable in OpenX Source 2.8.11 and earlier versions, potentially back to phpAdsNew 2.0.x.

### Details

The XML-RPC delivery invocation script was failing to escape its input parameters in the same way the other delivery methods do, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code via the “what” parameter of the delivery XML-RPC methods. Also, the escaping technique used to handle such parameter in the delivery scripts was based on the addslashes PHP function and has now been upgraded to use the dedicated escaping functions for the database in use.

* <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7149>

### Solution

We strongly advise people to upgrade to the most recent 3.0.2 version of Revive Adserver, including those running OpenX Source or older versions of the application.

In case the upgrade cannot be performed in a timely fashion, we suggest to delete the “www/delivery/axmlrpc.php” script (if not in use) as a temporary fix until the application is upgraded.
