Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly escape input parameters in the XML-RPC delivery invocation script within OpenX Source (2.8.11 and earlier) and Revive Adserver (<= 3.0.1). Specifically, the "what" parameter of the delivery XML-RPC methods was not adequately sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. The lack of proper escaping allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The escaping technique used was based on the `addslashes` PHP function, which was insufficient.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the application's backend.
- **Malware Distribution:** A critical risk is the potential to spread malware to visitors of websites and ad networks using the affected ad server. This is the most common goal observed by exploiters.
- **Data Manipulation/Disclosure:** While not explicitly detailed, successful SQL injection could also enable the attackers to manipulate or extract sensitive data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XML-RPC Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the XML-RPC delivery invocation script (`axmlrpc.php` and possibly `dxmlrpc.php`).
- **"what" Parameter:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code using the "what" parameter within the XML-RPC method calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send crafted XML-RPC requests to the vulnerable ad server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** They need to be aware of the SQL injection vulnerability and how to exploit it via the `what` parameter.
- **Exploitation Tools:** Attackers likely use automated tools to brute-force their way into systems.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is actively being exploited.
- The vulnerability is present in older versions potentially going back to phpAdsNew 2.0.x.
- The fix involves proper database-specific escaping techniques instead of `addslashes`.
- A temporary workaround suggested involves removing the `axmlrpc.php` and `dxmlrpc.php` files if XML-RPC delivery isn't being used.
- Patches were provided for both OpenX 2.8.11 and Revive 3.0.1.
- Revive Adserver released version 3.0.2 that fixed the vulnerability.
