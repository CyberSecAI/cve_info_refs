## VASCO IDENTIKEY Authentication Server contains an authentication bypass vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#612076

Original Release Date: 2014-01-09 | Last Revised: 2014-01-09

---

### Overview

VASCO IDENTIKEY Authentication Server version 3.4.x contains an authentication bypass vulnerability which could allow an attacker to login to a system without needing the user's Active Directory password credentials.

### Description

| [CWE-305](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/305.html): Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness  VASCO's IDENTIKEY Authentication Server (IAS) is a product which provides two-factor authentication capability. VASCO IDENTIKEY Authentication Server version 3.4.x contains an authentication bypass vulnerability which could allow an attacker to login to a system without needing the user's Active Directory password credentials. The expected behavior of the product is to authenticate a user from a RADIUS client if and only if that user enters a concatenation of his or her Microsoft Active Directory password credentials and a one-time password that is generated by an assigned DIGIPASS security token. The observed behavior is that the user need only enter the one-time password generated by the security token; the product will successfully authenticate the user when no Active Directory password is provided. This reduces two-factor authentication into one-factor authentication (i.e. just the one-time password generated using the security token). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with access to a user's authentication token or current code could login to a system without needing the user's Active Directory password credentials. |
