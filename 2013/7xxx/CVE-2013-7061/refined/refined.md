Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2013-7061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an improperly wrapped search API in Plone. Plone's search infrastructure is built upon CMF (Content Management Framework), which in turn is based on Zope. While Plone adds permission and expiry filters to its search API, one specific method was not adequately wrapped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The core vulnerability is a privilege escalation issue. Due to the exposed and unfiltered search method, users who can write untrusted Python code can bypass intended access controls.
*   **Information Exposure:** The improperly wrapped method can also lead to accidental exposure of content or data that should otherwise be protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to content they are not authorized to view or modify.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive information might be exposed unintentionally due to lack of proper permission checks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Untrusted Python Code:** An attacker needs to be able to execute untrusted Python code within the Plone environment.
*   **Direct Access to Unwrapped Search API:** The vulnerability exists in an unwrapped method in Plone's search API, which provides access to the underlying CMF and Zope components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to write and execute untrusted Python code within the Plone instance.

In summary, CVE-2013-7061 describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in Plone where an improperly protected search API method allows users with the ability to execute untrusted Python to bypass intended access controls and potentially expose sensitive information.
