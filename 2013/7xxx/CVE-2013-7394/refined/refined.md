Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-6771 (Note: The provided content is related to CVE-2013-6771, not CVE-2013-7394. Therefore, we are analyzing CVE-2013-6771)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the abuse of a test script mechanism in Splunk. Certain scripts intended for system operators to test and troubleshoot alert scripts could be misused by an authenticated Splunk user to execute arbitrary shell code on the host.
- Specifically, a malformed string sent to the "runshellscript echo.sh" script within the advanced search functionality could be leveraged for command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control/authorization: Authenticated users could access and abuse the test scripts not intended for general user access.
- Command injection:  The "runshellscript echo.sh" script was vulnerable to command injection through a malformed string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the Splunk process.
- Full system compromise is a possible outcome.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack via the Splunk web interface.
- Exploitation through the advanced search functionality by sending a malicious string to the vulnerable script.
- User interaction required in that target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Splunk user: The attacker must have valid credentials for a Splunk account.
- Network access to the Splunk instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Splunk version 5.0.5 by removing the vulnerable test scripts.
- The vulnerability was initially reported to the vendor on 2013-08-09
- The vulnerability was found by CyberCrown Ltd working with HPâ€™s Zero Day Initiative

**CVSS Score:**
- CVSS v2 Score: 9.0 (per ZDI advisory)
- CVSS Base Score 8.5, Overall 7 (per Splunk advisory)

This is an instance of a critical vulnerability that allows a remote attacker with valid Splunk credentials to gain full control of the system.
