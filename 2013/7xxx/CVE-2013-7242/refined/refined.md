Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `wordpress_import.php` file of Zenphoto.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The code constructs SQL queries using user-provided input (`$_REQUEST['tableprefix']`) without proper sanitization to prevent SQL injection. Specifically, the `sanitize` function uses `strip_tags`, which is insufficient for preventing SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to data exfiltration, modification or deletion and potentially complete compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through the `wordpress_import.php` file via HTTP requests. Specifically, the table prefix parameter passed via the `$_REQUEST` variable is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator of the Zenphoto instance to exploit this vulnerability. They also need to be able to provide the parameters `dbname`, `dbuser`, `dbpass`, `dbhost` and `tableprefix`.
