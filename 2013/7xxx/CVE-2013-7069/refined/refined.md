{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ack` utility allowed the use of the `--pager`, `--regex`, and `--output` options within project-level `.ackrc` configuration files. These options could be exploited to execute arbitrary code by specifying a malicious script or command.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted use of potentially dangerous options in configuration files.",
      "Lack of input sanitization or validation when processing configuration file contents."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could execute arbitrary code on a system by placing a malicious `.ackrc` file in a directory where `ack` is executed, or by convincing a user to run `ack` in a directory they control.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Placing a malicious `.ackrc` file in a directory.",
       "Tricking a user into running ack in a directory containing a malicious `.ackrc` file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify files in a location where ack is executed. This could be a shared directory, or a directory that the victim is tricked into working in.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability was mitigated by preventing the use of the --pager, --regex and --output options in project-level .ackrc files. These options can still be used from the global /etc/ackrc, the user's ~/.ackrc, the ACK_OPTIONS environment variable, or the command line."
