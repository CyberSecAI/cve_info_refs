openSUSE Security Update: update for ack
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:0142-1
Rating: moderate
References: #855340
Cross-References: CVE-2013-7069
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
- update to ack 2.12: fixes potential remote code execution
via per-project .ackrc files [bnc#855340] [CVE-2013-7069]
\* prevents the --pager, --regex and --output options from
being used from project-level ackrc files, preventing
possible code execution when using ack through
malicious files
\* --pager, --regex and --output options may still be used
from the global /etc/ackrc, your own private ~/.ackrc,
the ACK\_OPTIONS environment variable, and of course
from the command line.
\* Now ignores Eclipse .metadata directory.
- includes changes form 2.11\_02:
\* upstream source mispackaging fix
- includes changes from 2.11\_01
\* Fixed a race condition in t/file-permission.t that was
causing failures if tests were run in parallel.
- includes changes from 2.10:
\* Add --perltest for \*.t files
\* Added Matlab support
\* More compatibility fixes for Perl 5.8.8.
- includes changes from 2.08
\* ack now ignores CMake's build/cache directories by
default
\* Add shebang matching for --lua files
\* Add documentation for --ackrc
\* Add Elixir filetype
\* Add --cathy option
\* Add some helpful debugging tips when an invalid option
is found
\* Ignore PDF files by default, because Perl will detect
them as text
\* Ignore .gif, .jpg, .jpeg and .png files. They won't
normally be selected, but this is an optimization so
that ack doesn't have to open them to know
\* Ack's colorizing of output would get confused with
multiple sets of parentheses
\* Ack would get confused when trying to colorize the
output in DOS-format files
- includes changes from 2.05\_01
\* We now ignore the node\_modules directories created by
npm
\* --pager without an argument implies --pager=$PAGER
\* --perl now recognizes Plack-style .psgi files
\* Added filetypes for Coffescript, JSON, LESS, and Sass.
\* Command-line options now override options set in ackrc
files
\* ACK\_PAGER and ACK\_PAGER\_COLOR now work as advertised.
\* Fix a bug resulting in uninitialized variable warnings
when more than one capture group was specified in the
search pattern
\* Make sure ack is happy to build and test under cron and
other console-less environments.
- packaging changes:
\* run more rests with IO::Pty
\* refresh ack-ignore-osc.patch for upstream changes
\* update project URL
- port changes from devel:languages:perl ack by
daxim@cpan.org:
\* correct metadata: licence, CPAN download, homepage
\* unset forced prefix - let Perl configuration and
toolchain determine the prefix/install\_base which will
DTRT
\* bash completion is gone, remove dead code
- modified patches:
\* ack-ignore-osc.patch adjust for upstream source changes
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2014-87
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

## Description

[![@jimrandomh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101191?v=4&size=48)](/jimrandomh)[jimrandomh](https://github.com/jimrandomh)opened [on Nov 8, 2013](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack2/issues/399#issue-22353091)

Running "ack" in a directory which contains a malicious .ackrc will cause code execution. This is similar to the old Unix issue where if you put "." on your path, you can be tricked into running something named "ls": an attacker might scatter .ackrc files in different locations. It's not a huge risk, but it seems worth fixing.

The problem is the --pager option: a .ackrc file could say "--pager=./malicious.sh" (or even "--pager=./.ackrc"). The solution would be to forbid that option (and maybe also --output=expr?) in project ackrc files (but still allow it in other places).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
