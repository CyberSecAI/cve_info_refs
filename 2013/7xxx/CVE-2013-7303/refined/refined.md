Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of author names within the SPIP content management system. Specifically, author names were not properly sanitized when displayed in article signatures and author pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is an XSS issue. Malicious code could be injected through an author's name field, which is then executed in the context of a user's browser when the author's information is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of this XSS vulnerability is that an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim user's browser, leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of web pages.
    - Redirection to malicious sites.
    - Other attacks that leverage client-side scripting.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the author's name field in SPIP. An attacker, who has author privileges, can inject malicious JavaScript code into their name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have author privileges to be able to set a malicious name. The attacker can also be an existing author that has been compromised.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in SPIP version 3.0.13 and also backported to the 2.1 branch.
- The fix involved sanitizing the author's name to prevent the execution of injected script code.
