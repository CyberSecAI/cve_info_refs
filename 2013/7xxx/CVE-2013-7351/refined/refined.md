Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7351:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the output of the `pageUrl()` function, which is used in several locations within the `index.php` file of Shaarli. This allows for the injection of malicious code when the URL contains special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, multiple instances of XSS are present in the `index.php` file due to the lack of sanitization of the `pageUrl()` output. The vulnerable lines of code are:

*   Line 945: `echo '</channel></rss><!-- Cached version of ' . pageurl () . ' -->';`
*   Line 1030: `$feed .= '</feed><!-- Cached version of ' . pageurl () . ' -->'; echo $feed;`
*  Line 1107: `echo '</channel></rss><!-- Cached version of ' . pageurl () . ' -->';`
* Line 1750: `echo '<script language="JavaScript">alert("File ' . $filename . ' (' . $filesize . ' bytes) was successfully processed: ' . $import_count . ' links imported.");document.location=\'?\';</script>';`
   
**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
* Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
* Steal sensitive information like cookies or session tokens.
* Redirect users to malicious websites.
* Perform actions on behalf of the user.
* Deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL for the Shaarli instance, which would then inject the malicious script into the page when the `pageUrl()` output is used. This could involve manipulating URL parameters or the domain itself. Another vector is through a malicious file upload, where the filename is not sanitized before being used in a javascript alert.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to:
1.  Have knowledge of the Shaarli instance.
2.  Be able to craft a malicious URL or filename for file upload that includes malicious script.
3.  Have a user visit the crafted URL or upload the crafted file.

The provided content includes the commit that fixed the vulnerability, which introduced `htmlspecialchars()` function calls to sanitize the output of `pageUrl()` and `json_encode()` for the filename, which prevents the injection of malicious code.
