## Description

[![@jacobamey](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3608280?v=4&size=48)](/jacobamey)[jacobamey](https://github.com/jacobamey)opened [on Nov 20, 2013](https://github.com/mikaku/Monitorix/issues/30#issue-23013284)

Note, these should not be a huge issue if utilizing a proper firewall. But it might be something you would want to look into and fix anyways.

These where found by a Nessus scan performed against a server running Monitorix.

First One:

Severity: HIGH

Exploit:

Goscript go.cgi Arbitrary Command Execution

Description

The remote host is running GoScript. The installed version fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'go.cgi' script. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on the remote host.

Solution

There is no known solution at this time.

See Also

<http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2004-08/0037.html>

Plugin Output

It was possible to execute the command 'id' on the remote host

by requesting the following URL :

[http://10.19.75.76:8080/amPortal/action/go.cgi|id|](http://10.19.75.76:8080/amPortal/action/go.cgi%7Cid%7C)

Second One:

Severity: Medium

Exploit

Web Server Generic Cookie Injection

Description

The remote host is running a web server that fails to adequately sanitize request strings of malicious JavaScript. By leveraging this issue, an attacker may be able to inject arbitrary cookies. Depending on the structure of the web application, it may be possible to launch a 'session fixation' attack using this mechanism.

Solution

Contact the vendor for a patch or upgrade.

<http://www.acros.si/papers/session_fixation.pdf>

<http://projects.webappsec.org/Session-Fixation>

Plugin Output

The request string used to detect this flaw was :

/<script>document.cookie=%22testzgsf=9268;%22</script>

The output was :

HTTP/1.0 404 Not found

Date: Wed, 20 Nov 2013 13:34:54 -0500

Server: Monitorix HTTP Server

Connection: close

Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

[...]

<title>404 Not Found</title>
# Not Found

The requested URL /<script>document.cookie="testzgsf=9268;"</script> was not found on this server.

---

Monitorix HTTP Server listening at localhost Port 8080
[...]

Third one:

Severity: Medium

Exploit

Web Server Generic XSS

Description

The remote host is running a web server that fails to adequately sanitize request strings of malicious JavaScript. By leveraging this issue, an attacker may be able to cause arbitrary HTML and script code to be executed in a user's browser within the security context of the affected site.

Solution

Contact the vendor for a patch or upgrade.

See Also

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting>

Plugin Output

The request string used to detect this flaw was :

/<script>cross\_site\_scripting.nasl</script>.asp

The output was :

HTTP/1.0 404 Not found

Date: Wed, 20 Nov 2013 13:36:20 -0500

Server: Monitorix HTTP Server

Connection: close

Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8

# Not Found

The requested URL /<script>cross\_site\_scripting.nasl</script>.asp was no

Use CVE-2013-7070.

Note that, at the moment, we think there isn't sufficient evidence
that "session fixation" in this context is an independent
vulnerability, and thus there is no CVE ID for that.

> <http://www.monitorix.org/news.html> also says "3.4.0 version
> released ... 02-Dec-2013 ... This version also fixes an important
> number of bugs and two security issues ... not covered yet in the
> previous 3.3.1 version."

For the XSS issue for the PATH_INFO (aka the $url variable), fixed in
3.4.0, use CVE-2013-7071.

For the other issue (the unspecified issue of the "two security
issues") fixed in 3.4.0, use CVE-2013-7072.

For the out-of-context reference to go.cgi in GoScript, use
CVE-2004-2776.
