Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7071:

**Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2013-7071 and describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Monitorix's HTTP server. This aligns with the CVE description which indicates this CVE is assigned to XSS vulnerability in the PATH_INFO variable.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `PATH_INFO` variable (represented as `$url` in the code) within the `handle_request` function of Monitorix's built-in HTTP server. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL, which is then reflected back to the user in the server's response without being sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where malicious scripts included in the URL can be executed within a user's browser in the context of the vulnerable site.
*  **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The server fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the URL path, before reflecting it back to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser, potentially leading to various attacks.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Malicious JavaScript could be used to steal session cookies and impersonate a user.
*   **Defacement:** The injected script could modify the content of the page, potentially defacing the website.
*   **Redirect to Malicious Sites:** The injected script could redirect the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted URL:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into the URL.
*   **User interaction:** Users then access this malicious URL which causes the JavaScript to execute in their browser when the server reflects the unsanitized URL in its response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   The attacker needs to get a victim to visit the malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `lib/HTTPServer.pm` file, specifically the `handle_request` subroutine.
*   The vulnerability is triggered due to the lack of sanitization of the `$url` (or `path_info()`) variable in the HTTP server.
*   The fix involves replacing unsafe characters (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `/`)  in the `$url` variable with HTML entities in the `$url_disarmed` variable.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided github content shows that this vulnerability has been patched by replacing unsafe characters (`&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `(`, `)`, `/`) in the `$url` with HTML entities in the `$url_disarmed` variable.
*   The original report mentions a Nessus scan identified this issue.
*   The report also mentions two other related issues that were assigned their own CVEs (CVE-2013-7070, CVE-2013-7072), and a completely separate issue (CVE-2004-2776) related to `go.cgi`.
