Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2013-7404:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from ics-cert.us-cert.gov explicitly mentions CVE-2013-7404 in relation to GE Healthcare's Discovery NM750b breast imaging system. The Forbes article also corroborates this information, specifically mentioning the Discovery NM750b and its default credentials. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the use of **default or hard-coded credentials** in GE Healthcare's medical imaging devices. These credentials are often easily guessable, consisting of simple usernames and passwords.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The devices fail to enforce strong password policies, using default, weak, or easily-guessed passwords.
*  **Default Credentials:** Devices ship with factory-set username/password combinations that are often publicly available or easily discovered.
*   **Insufficient Password Complexity:** Passwords are short, lack symbols, and are often common words.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Authentication:** Attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the affected devices.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive patient data (including scanned images and personal information) stored on the devices can be accessed and stolen.
*   **Device Manipulation:** Attackers can potentially modify device configurations (e.g., increase radiation dosage), leading to direct harm to patients.
*   **Network Compromise:** Exploiting these devices can provide a foothold into the broader hospital network, leading to further attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability if the affected devices are accessible over the network (including the internet).
*   **Compromised Hospital Network:** An attacker who has already compromised the hospital network can exploit the weak authentication of devices on the internal network.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill Level:** The Forbes article mentions that a low-skill attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network connectivity to the device, either through direct exposure over the internet or from within a compromised network.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** The attacker needs to be aware of the default username and passwords to gain access to the vulnerable systems. This information is publicly available.

**Additional Details:**

* The Forbes article highlights that some GE documentation advised against changing default passwords, as it could hinder support services. This further exacerbates the vulnerability.
*  The ICS-CERT advisory assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 to the vulnerabilities across affected devices, reflecting a high severity.

In summary, CVE-2013-7404 is due to the use of default/hardcoded credentials in GE Healthcare's Discovery NM750b breast imaging system, allowing for unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential patient harm. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely and requires low attacker skill.
