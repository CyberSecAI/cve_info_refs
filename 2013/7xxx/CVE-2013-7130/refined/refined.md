As a result, when an error code was not recognized in the database backend, the connection was not restored even if we specified a retry interval in the configuration. Thus, although the error was related to losing the connection, Compute was not trying to reconnect. This was fixed by adding the MySQL error code 2013 to the known database error codes. Now the MySQL error code is properly handled by the backend. | | | Clone Of: | [1060687](show_bug.cgi?id=1060687 \"CLOSED ERRATA - DB connection error code 2013 not handled\") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2014-03-04 19:05:31 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| --- | | |\n\n| | Attachments | [(Terms of Use)](page.cgi?id=terms-conditions.html) | | | --- | --- | --- | |  | | |    Links | System | ID | Private | Priority | Status | Summary | Last Updated | | Red Hat Issue Tracker | [OSP-16403](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSP-16403) | 0 | None | None | None | 2022-07-09 06:28:36 UTC | | Red Hat Product Errata | [RHSA-2014:0231](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014%3A0231) | 0 | normal | SHIPPED_LIVE | Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update | 2014-03-05 00:00:29 UTC | |  | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n\n| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1060771#c0)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-02-03 14:50:56 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1060687](show_bug.cgi?id=1060687 \"CLOSED ERRATA - DB connection error code 2013 not handled\") +++  As part of the RHOS High Availability we need to tune connections to database and qpid.  Some of those options include daemons startup behavior and specifically:  max_retries = -1 retry_interval = 1  to allow the daemon to continue retrying connecting.  This is a blocker to deploy cinder in HA environments and must be fixed asap.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1060771#c1)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-02-03 14:54:37 UTC  ``` Extra info:  starting nova-consoleauth with db offline will result in a python traceback.
