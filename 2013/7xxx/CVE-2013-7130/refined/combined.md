As a result, when an error code was not recognized in the database backend, the connection was not restored even if we specified a retry interval in the configuration. Thus, although the error was related to losing the connection, Compute was not trying to reconnect. This was fixed by adding the MySQL error code 2013 to the known database error codes. Now the MySQL error code is properly handled by the backend. | | | Clone Of: | [1060687](show_bug.cgi?id=1060687 "CLOSED ERRATA - DB connection error code 2013 not handled") | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2014-03-04 19:05:31 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1060771#c0)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-02-03 14:50:56 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1060687](show_bug.cgi?id=1060687 "CLOSED ERRATA - DB connection error code 2013 not handled") +++  As part of the RHOS High Availability we need to tune connections to database and qpid.  Some of those options include daemons startup behavior and specifically:  max_retries = -1 retry_interval = 1  to allow the daemon to continue retrying connecting.  This is a blocker to deploy cinder in HA environments and must be fixed asap.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1060771#c1)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2014-02-03 14:54:37 UTC  ``` Extra info:  starting nova-consoleauth with db offline will result in a python traceback. Other part of openstack will at least attempt to connect 10 times.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1060771#c3)  Ami Jeain    2014-02-19 13:04:32 UTC  ``` verified although there is a new issue. Nova is not able to move the spawning instance to Active. User will have to boot a new instance. Opening a new bug on this one   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1060771#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-03-04 19:05:31 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0231.html>   ``` |  |

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix multiple security issues and
several bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform 4.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

It was discovered that the metadata agent in OpenStack Networking was
missing an authorization check on the device ID that is bound to a specific
port. A remote tenant could guess the instance ID bound to a port and
retrieve metadata of another tenant, resulting in information disclosure.
Note that only OpenStack Networking setups running neutron-metadata-agent
were affected. (CVE-2013-6419)

It was found that nova used directories that were writable to by all local
users to temporarily store live snapshots. A local attacker with access to
such a directory could use this flaw to read and modify the contents of
live snapshots. (CVE-2013-7048)

A flaw was found in the way the libvirt driver handled short-lived disk
back-up files on Compute nodes. An authenticated attacker could use this
flaw to create a large number of such files, exhausting all available space
on Compute node disks, and potentially causing a denial of service.
Note that only Compute setups using the libvirt driver were affected.
(CVE-2013-6437)

It was discovered that the libvirt driver did not properly handle live
migration of virtual machines. An authenticated attacker could use this
flaw to gain access to a snapshot of a migrated virtual machine. Note that
only setups using KVM live block migration were affected. (CVE-2013-7130)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting
CVE-2013-6419, CVE-2013-6437, and CVE-2013-7130. Upstream acknowledges
Aaron Rosen of VMware as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6419, Phil Day
from HP as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6437, and Loganathan Parthipan
as the original reporter of CVE-2013-7130.

These updated openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream
version 2013.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous
version. (BZ#1065317)

Bug fixes:

* The GlusterFS volume connector in nova did not pass a port to libvirt for

the GlusterFS disk specification. Attaching a volume failed with a libvirt
error indicating the port field was missing. This update fixes this bug by
providing the default Gluster port in nova. (BZ#1020979)

* The database back end did not handle the 2013 MySQL error code (Lost

connection). The 2013 MySQL error code has been added to the collection of
known database error codes. (BZ#1060771)

* OpenStack Compute set the smbios product/vendor information to OpenStack

values, which Red Hat Satellite 5 did not recognize when processing
entitlements. (BZ#1059414)

* Prior to this update, nova-api did not pass the absolute path of the

configuration file to the api-paste library if a file with the same name
was found in the current directory. (BZ#1039554)

* The definition of the libvirt\_info method in the RBD back-end class was

missing a positional argument that the base class defined. (BZ#1063445)

* Rebooting a host caused all of its instances to stop and change to the

SHUTDOWN power state. The unpause action was only allowed on instances with
the PAUSED power state. (BZ#1047863)

* The previous default of writing zeros over deleted volumes took a

significant amount of time. It is now possible to set a global
configuration setting to clear only a part of a volume, or to disable
clearing completely. Additionally, a new 'shred' capability is available to
overwrite volumes with random data instead of zeros. (BZ#1062377)

* In OpenStack Compute, low-level QPID debug log messages are no longer

shown by default. These previously appeared due to the 'level=debug'
parameter set in the nova.conf file. (BZ#1047849)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues.

Subject: [OSSA 2014-003] Live migration can leak root disk into ephemeral
 storage (CVE-2013-7130)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-003
CVE: CVE-2013-7130
Date: January 23, 2014

Title: Live migration can leak root disk into ephemeral storage
Reporter: Loganathan Parthipan (HP)
Products: Nova
Affects: All supported versions

Description:
Loganathan Parthipan from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in
the Nova libvirt driver. By spawning a server with the same flavor as
another user's migrated virtual machine, an authenticated user can
potentially access that user's snapshot content resulting in information
leakage. Only setups using KVM live block migration are affected.

Icehouse (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68658/>

Havana (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68659/>

Grizzly fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/#/c/68660/>

### Bug Description

During pre-live-migration required disks are created along with their backing files (if they don't already exist). However, the ephemeral backing file is created from a glance downloaded root disk.

# If the required ephemeral backing file is present then there's no issue.

# If the required ephemeral backing file is not already present, then the root disk is downloaded and saved as the ephemeral backing file. This will result in the following situations:

## The disk.local transferred during live-migration will be rebased on the ephemeral backing file so regardless of the content, the end result will be identical to the source disk.local.

## However, if a new instance of the same flavor is spawned on this compute node, then it will have an ephemeral storage that exposes a root disk.

Security concerns:

If the migrated VM was spawned off a snapshot, now it's possible for any instances of the correct flavor to see the snapshot contents of another user via the ephemeral storage.

This sounds fairly serious to me at first pass. Any idea which releases are affected?

Nova security reviewers, any input on the proposed patch above?

The fix seems sane to me, but I am not familiar with libvirt so I would like to see someone more knowledgeable confirm. It just appears that root disks won't be downloaded for ephemeral backing files, and empty images will be created.

But this fix does seem to just address instances migrated after the patch, is there anyway to retroactively address this in cases that a root disk has already been downloaded?

The following is suitable for deployments where it's possible to just put together a script and execute.

1. Delete all ephemeral backing files not currently being referred to by a disk.local cow layer. It's better to delete all such unused ephemeral files since step 2 below can be unreliable.

2. Identify the ephemeral files that are root disk images. This is quite straightforward if all the root disks have a partition table and all we do is look at the file signature to determine if there's a partitionless image with ext3 fs on it. But on a system with user uploaded glance files or where there are single partition root disks with kernel, there could be several false negatives. Anyway, assuming we managed to determine if a compute node has a bad ephemeral backing file then we should first disable the service to prevent any more instance scheduling on that node.

3. Then we could isolate all the VMs using the bad ephemeral file(s) to a set of fresh nodes using live-migration and delete the now unused bad ephemeral files and enable scheduling again.

If one doesn't want to take the chance with step 2 above, a more deterministic approach would be to migrate all the VMs at least once to a node known to contain none or new correct ephemeral disks.

What this gives us is that all ephemeral backing files will be corrected and new instances will see the expected block device with an ext3 fs. All existing VMs will continue to run including those that had already seen the exposed data. However, they all would be backed on good ephemeral backing files.

So IIUC the issue can only happen when the block migration is used, as this code path is only hit if there is no shared storage - this is a limited use case, and the bug does not affect all live migration setups. I am saying this just for clarity - we should definitely fix the issue asap.

The fix looks like a good start, however I think that we should special-case the swap as well. For inspiration see nova.virt.libvirt.driver \_create\_image method that does these things on instance boot.

Ok so this looks much better now. Launchpad is horrible for commenting on patches, but several issues with ephemerals that I can see:

  + fs\_label='ephemeral0',

This should be cache\_name since there can be more than one ephemeral disk

  + ephemeral\_size=instance['ephemeral\_gb'])

This is not always true - we are able to specify the size of ephemerals too through block device mapping. This is tricky since we don't have that info in the xml. I am not sure how to handle this - I need to look into this a bit more.

Having the correct size on an ephemeral backing file is important IMHO only on new instance spawning, since it may expects a filesystem with the size promised by the flavor. During migration it's going to be rebased anyway with the existing information from the qcow2 layer.

So to understand the second issue a bit more, are we going to have a backing file of some name ephemeral\_SIZE\_OS\_TYPE but not of size SIZE?

Hey, so - agreed on the size point. The fs\_label should be ephemeral0, ephemeral1 etc. Not a huge deal imho.

Consider the patch +2 from my side.

And a huge thank you for fixing this so quickly.

I'm a bit confused on the multiple ephemeral disk code. It appears that regardless of the number of disks created, the backing file is the same. ie fname = "ephemeral\_%s\_%s" % (eph['size'], os\_type\_with\_default) is not dependent on idx. So I'm wondering if only ephemeral0 will be used in the backing file and the rest used in the qcow2 layers. If that's the case we hardcoding 'ephemeral0' for fs\_label won't break anything.

Maybe I misread, but,

    size=info['virt\_disk\_size'],

for swap should it be

    size = swap\_mb \* unit.Mi

based on code further down the file?

So I'm wondering if only ephemeral0 will be used in the backing file and the rest used in the qcow2 layers. If that's the case we hardcoding 'ephemeral0' for fs\_label won't break anything.

so - we go back to the size issue - each ephemeral drive will have a backing file (assuming qcow Images are used by Nova) that is named

  fname = "ephemeral\_%s\_%s" % (eph['size'], os\_type\_with\_default)

the sizes however can vary from device to device, so if we have for example an instances that allows ephemeral to be 100G we could have a disk of 50 and two disks of 25 - this will result in two backing files ephemeral\_25\_blah and ephemeral\_50\_blah and 3 qcow overlays - two that have the 25 one as base and one that has 50.

The fs\_label is applied to the original file when created and it makes no sense for it to be ephemeral0,1 etc... or we should be formatting the newly created overlay which kind of defeats the purpose of having backing files. I will likely file a separate bug for this

Also Tom is right wrt size. The thing is - we will not be getting the real size here, as the user could have overriden it through block device mapping, and we do not save that in the xml.

In the long run - we should really be using the db data to do this and not only the xml, but that is definitely outside of the scope of the bugfix - so as soon as you fix the swap issue - I am +2 on this.

Draft impact description -

Title : Live migration can leak root disk into ephemeral storage

Reporter: Loganathan Parthipan

Products : nova

Affects : grizzly, havana, icehouse

Description : Loganathan Parthipan reported a vulnerability in the nova libvirt driver. By live migrating a snapshotted virtual machine the contents of the snapshot could potentially be leaked via ephemeral storage. Only setups using KVM live block migration are affected.

Grant, a few remarks:

- We usually credit the company the reporter works for, if he provides one.

- We capitalize "Nova"

- For the affects line, we now use "All supported versions" which is a bit more accurate than an enumartion of versions. This may or may not affect Folsom, but we don't care because it's no longer supported...

- I would precise the attack scenario a bit more, in this case what type of attacker, and how they would get access to the leak. Is it local user ? Another cloud user ? In this case, I would add "An authenticated user could potentially access snapshot content by spawning new servers from the right flavor" or something like it

- We do not have space before colons (header-style)

- We usually add a newline after "Description:"

Title: Live migration can leak root disk into ephemeral storage

Reporter: Loganathan Parthipan

Products: Nova

Affects: All supported versions

Description:

Loganathan Parthipan from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in the Nova libvirt driver. By spawning a server with the same flavor as another users migrated virtual machine an authenticated user can potentially access that users snapshot content resulting in information leakage. Only setups using KVM live block migration are affected.

@Grant: looks good. I would just add " (HP)" at the end of the Reporter: line and add a comma between "machine" and "an" in the description.

Also, should be "user's" in two places (possessive form). Otherwise, with Thierry's recommendations in mind, the impact description text in comment #27 looks fine to me.

All,

Wondering if we should open this up because of [https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1237683](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/%2Bbug/1237683) comment #1 (basically mentioning the crux of the security issue publicly), or move it along quickly.

I've found several more issues while fixing this that would be good to report and start fixing.

I think the comment in [bug 1237683](/bugs/1237683) is vague enough as to not point out the security risks involved, so there may still be some benefit to keeping this embargoed while your patches are reviewed here.

libvirt: Fix root disk leak in live mig

This patch makes sure that i\_create\_images\_and\_backing method of the

    libvirt driver (called in several places, but most problematic one is

    the call in the pre\_live\_migration method) creates all the files the

    instance needs that are not present.

Prioir to this patch - the method would only attempt to download the

    image, and if it did so with the path of the ephemeral drives, it could

    expose the image to other users as an ephemeral devices. See the related

    bug for more detaiis.

After this patch - we properly distinguish between image, ephemeral and

    swap files, and make sure that the imagebackend does the correct thing.

Closes-bug: #1251590

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2247-1: OpenStack Nova vulnerabilities

17 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in OpenStack Nova.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [nova](/security/cves?package=nova) - OpenStack Compute cloud infrastructure

## Details

Darragh O'Reilly discovered that the Ubuntu packaging for OpenStack Nova

did not properly set up its sudo configuration. If a different flaw was

found in OpenStack Nova, this vulnerability could be used to escalate

privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-1068](/security/CVE-2013-1068))

Bernhard M. Wiedemann and Pedraig Brady discovered that OpenStack Nova did

not properly verify the virtual size of a QCOW2 images. A remote

authenticated attacker could exploit this to create a denial of service via

disk consumption. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-4463](/security/CVE-2013-4463), [CVE-2013-4469](/security/CVE-2013-4469))

JuanFra Rodriguez Cardoso discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce

SSL connections when Nova was configured to use QPid and qpid\_protocol is

set to 'ssl'. If a remote attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle

attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. Ubuntu

does not use QPid with Nova by default. This issue did not affect Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-6491](/security/CVE-2013-6491))

Loganathan Parthipan discovered that OpenStack Nova did not properly create

expected files during KVM live block migration. A remote authenticated

attacker could exploit this to obtain root disk snapshot contents via

ephemeral storage. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2013-7130](/security/CVE-2013-7130))

Stanislaw Pitucha discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce the image

format when rescuing an instance. A remote authenticated attacker could

exploit this to read host files. In the default installation, attackers

would be isolated by the libvirt guest AppArmor profile. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0134](/security/CVE-2014-0134))

Mark Heckmann discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce RBAC policy

when adding security group rules via the EC2 API. A remote authenticated

user could exploit this to gain unintended access to this API. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0167](/security/CVE-2014-0167))

### Reduce your security exposure

### Bug Description

During pre-live-migration required disks are created along with their backing files (if they don't already exist). However, the ephemeral backing file is created from a glance downloaded root disk.

# If the required ephemeral backing file is present then there's no issue.

# If the required ephemeral backing file is not already present, then the root disk is downloaded and saved as the ephemeral backing file. This will result in the following situations:

## The disk.local transferred during live-migration will be rebased on the ephemeral backing file so regardless of the content, the end result will be identical to the source disk.local.

## However, if a new instance of the same flavor is spawned on this compute node, then it will have an ephemeral storage that exposes a root disk.

Security concerns:

If the migrated VM was spawned off a snapshot, now it's possible for any instances of the correct flavor to see the snapshot contents of another user via the ephemeral storage.

The fix seems sane to me, but I am not familiar with libvirt so I would like to see someone more knowledgeable confirm. It just appears that root disks won't be downloaded for ephemeral backing files, and empty images will be created.

But this fix does seem to just address instances migrated after the patch, is there anyway to retroactively address this in cases that a root disk has already been downloaded?

The following is suitable for deployments where it's possible to just put together a script and execute.

1. Delete all ephemeral backing files not currently being referred to by a disk.local cow layer. It's better to delete all such unused ephemeral files since step 2 below can be unreliable.

2. Identify the ephemeral files that are root disk images. This is quite straightforward if all the root disks have a partition table and all we do is look at the file signature to determine if there's a partitionless image with ext3 fs on it. But on a system with user uploaded glance files or where there are single partition root disks with kernel, there could be several false negatives. Anyway, assuming we managed to determine if a compute node has a bad ephemeral backing file then we should first disable the service to prevent any more instance scheduling on that node.

3. Then we could isolate all the VMs using the bad ephemeral file(s) to a set of fresh nodes using live-migration and delete the now unused bad ephemeral files and enable scheduling again.

If one doesn't want to take the chance with step 2 above, a more deterministic approach would be to migrate all the VMs at least once to a node known to contain none or new correct ephemeral disks.

What this gives us is that all ephemeral backing files will be corrected and new instances will see the expected block device with an ext3 fs. All existing VMs will continue to run including those that had already seen the exposed data. However, they all would be backed on good ephemeral backing files.

So IIUC the issue can only happen when the block migration is used, as this code path is only hit if there is no shared storage - this is a limited use case, and the bug does not affect all live migration setups. I am saying this just for clarity - we should definitely fix the issue asap.

The fix looks like a good start, however I think that we should special-case the swap as well. For inspiration see nova.virt.libvirt.driver \_create\_image method that does these things on instance boot.

Ok so this looks much better now. Launchpad is horrible for commenting on patches, but several issues with ephemerals that I can see:

  + fs\_label='ephemeral0',

This should be cache\_name since there can be more than one ephemeral disk

  + ephemeral\_size=instance['ephemeral\_gb'])

This is not always true - we are able to specify the size of ephemerals too through block device mapping. This is tricky since we don't have that info in the xml. I am not sure how to handle this - I need to look into this a bit more.

Having the correct size on an ephemeral backing file is important IMHO only on new instance spawning, since it may expects a filesystem with the size promised by the flavor. During migration it's going to be rebased anyway with the existing information from the qcow2 layer.

So to understand the second issue a bit more, are we going to have a backing file of some name ephemeral\_SIZE\_OS\_TYPE but not of size SIZE?

Hey, so - agreed on the size point. The fs\_label should be ephemeral0, ephemeral1 etc. Not a huge deal imho.

Consider the patch +2 from my side.

And a huge thank you for fixing this so quickly.

I'm a bit confused on the multiple ephemeral disk code. It appears that regardless of the number of disks created, the backing file is the same. ie fname = "ephemeral\_%s\_%s" % (eph['size'], os\_type\_with\_default) is not dependent on idx. So I'm wondering if only ephemeral0 will be used in the backing file and the rest used in the qcow2 layers. If that's the case we hardcoding 'ephemeral0' for fs\_label won't break anything.

Maybe I misread, but,

    size=info['virt\_disk\_size'],

for swap should it be

    size = swap\_mb \* unit.Mi

based on code further down the file?

So I'm wondering if only ephemeral0 will be used in the backing file and the rest used in the qcow2 layers. If that's the case we hardcoding 'ephemeral0' for fs\_label won't break anything.

so - we go back to the size issue - each ephemeral drive will have a backing file (assuming qcow Images are used by Nova) that is named

  fname = "ephemeral\_%s\_%s" % (eph['size'], os\_type\_with\_default)

the sizes however can vary from device to device, so if we have for example an instances that allows ephemeral to be 100G we could have a disk of 50 and two disks of 25 - this will result in two backing files ephemeral\_25\_blah and ephemeral\_50\_blah and 3 qcow overlays - two that have the 25 one as base and one that has 50.

The fs\_label is applied to the original file when created and it makes no sense for it to be ephemeral0,1 etc... or we should be formatting the newly created overlay which kind of defeats the purpose of having backing files. I will likely file a separate bug for this

Also Tom is right wrt size. The thing is - we will not be getting the real size here, as the user could have overriden it through block device mapping, and we do not save that in the xml.

In the long run - we should really be using the db data to do this and not only the xml, but that is definitely outside of the scope of the bugfix - so as soon as you fix the swap issue - I am +2 on this.

Here's the patch,

tests pass - but we need more tests for this - I was working on adding them today but didn't manage.

We can post a fix and add tests later too actually.

Thanks Nikola. The patch looks good to me, but tests would certainly be good to help prevent regressions.

Draft impact description -

Title : Live migration can leak root disk into ephemeral storage

Reporter: Loganathan Parthipan

Products : nova

Affects : grizzly, havana, icehouse

Description : Loganathan Parthipan reported a vulnerability in the nova libvirt driver. By live migrating a snapshotted virtual machine the contents of the snapshot could potentially be leaked via ephemeral storage. Only setups using KVM live block migration are affected.

Grant, a few remarks:

- We usually credit the company the reporter works for, if he provides one.

- We capitalize "Nova"

- For the affects line, we now use "All supported versions" which is a bit more accurate than an enumartion of versions. This may or may not affect Folsom, but we don't care because it's no longer supported...

- I would precise the attack scenario a bit more, in this case what type of attacker, and how they would get access to the leak. Is it local user ? Another cloud user ? In this case, I would add "An authenticated user could potentially access snapshot content by spawning new servers from the right flavor" or something like it

- We do not have space before colons (header-style)

- We usually add a newline after "Description:"

Also, should be "user's" in two places (possessive form). Otherwise, with Thierry's recommendations in mind, the impact description text in comment #27 looks fine to me.

All,

Wondering if we should open this up because of [https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1237683](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/%2Bbug/1237683) comment #1 (basically mentioning the crux of the security issue publicly), or move it along quickly.

I've found several more issues while fixing this that would be good to report and start fixing.

I think the comment in [bug 1237683](/bugs/1237683) is vague enough as to not point out the security risks involved, so there may still be some benefit to keeping this embargoed while your patches are reviewed here.

libvirt: Fix root disk leak in live mig

This patch makes sure that i\_create\_images\_and\_backing method of the

    libvirt driver (called in several places, but most problematic one is

    the call in the pre\_live\_migration method) creates all the files the

    instance needs that are not present.

Prioir to this patch - the method would only attempt to download the

    image, and if it did so with the path of the ephemeral drives, it could

    expose the image to other users as an ephemeral devices. See the related

    bug for more detaiis.

After this patch - we properly distinguish between image, ephemeral and

    swap files, and make sure that the imagebackend does the correct thing.

Closes-bug: #1251590
