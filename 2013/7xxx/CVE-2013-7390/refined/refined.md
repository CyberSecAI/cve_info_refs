Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-7390

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `AgentLogUploadServlet` of ManageEngine Desktop Central. This servlet accepts input from HTTP POST requests and creates an output file on the server. The core issue is the lack of any sanitization or authentication checks when constructing the file path.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The servlet allows uploading files to the server without proper validation of the file path or type.
- **Path Traversal:** The way the path is constructed allows attackers to traverse directories to the application web root using `..` in the filename parameter.
- **Lack of Authentication:** No authentication is required to access and use this vulnerable servlet.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a malicious JSP file into the web root. This JSP file will then be executed by the web server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with `NT-AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** Due to the high privileges associated with the execution, the attacker can gain full control over the affected server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `agentLogUploader` servlet.
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious JSP file embedded within the POST request data.
- **Path Traversal:** The attacker uses `..` in the filename parameter to navigate to the web root directory.
- **Web Browser Request:** The attacker sends a GET request to access the uploaded JSP file, causing the malicious code to be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Desktop Central server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URI (`/agentLogUploader`).
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with a specified filename that includes directory traversal characters and a malicious JSP payload.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit was demonstrated at Kiwicon 7.
- A Metasploit module was created to exploit this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Desktop Central versions below 80293.
- The vendor issued a patch (Patch 80293) to address this vulnerability.
