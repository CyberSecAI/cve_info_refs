Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7319:

**Verification:**
The exploit-db entry for EDB-ID 30105 explicitly mentions CVE-2013-7319 and describes a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "WordPress Plugin Download Manager Free & Pro 2.5.8". This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of the "title" input field when creating a new download package.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code injected into the title field is stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected content (e.g., the download package).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the title field of a download package. This malicious code could be executed in the browsers of other users (including administrators) who interact with the affected content.
- **Cookie Theft:** The example payload `<input onmouseover=prompt(document.cookie)>` shows how an attacker can steal user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Other Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform other malicious actions, such as redirecting users to phishing pages, modifying site content, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Injection:** The primary attack vector is through the title input field when creating a new download package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the area where they can create download packages.  The content does not explicitly state that this area is only available to administrator users, only that the XSS is persistent and will impact other users (including administrators) when the title is rendered.
- **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of web development and XSS vulnerabilities to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit-db entry references a blog post ([http://www.nerdbox.it/wordpress-download-manager-xss/](http://www.nerdbox.it/wordpress-download-manager-xss/)), which provides additional information, including screenshots.
- The vulnerable plugin version is explicitly stated as "2.5.8", but the exploit-db entry also says "v3.3.8". The WordPress plugin page does state that version 3.3.04 fixes a number of security issues, but there was no mention of this specific vulnerability being fixed at this time.

In summary, CVE-2013-7319 describes a persistent XSS vulnerability in the Download Manager plugin for WordPress, which allows authenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code via the package title field.
