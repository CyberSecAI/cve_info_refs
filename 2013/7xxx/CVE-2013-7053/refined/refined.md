- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The D-Link DIR-100 router's web interface does not properly validate or protect against CSRF attacks. Specifically, the `cli.cgi` script that handles various router configurations can be accessed via unauthenticated requests when the user is already logged in from the same IP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The web interface does not validate the origin of the requests, allowing attackers to craft malicious requests that execute privileged commands. 
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can remotely send a specially crafted request to a victim, and if the victim is logged in to the router's web interface, the request will be executed with the victim's privileges. This could lead to full device compromise, including:
    - Changing the administrator password.
    - Enabling remote access.
    - Modifying other device settings.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a malicious HTTP request sent to a logged-in user's browser, typically through a link on a website or an email. The user doesn't have to actively interact with the request after clicking the link; the browser will perform it automatically if a session is active.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user logged into the router's web interface to load a malicious crafted request. The attacker doesn't need to have prior authentication or direct access to the router's web interface.
