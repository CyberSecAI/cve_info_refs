{
  "CVE-2013-7267": {
    "description": "An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.",
    "root_cause": "The `recvmsg` handlers were not properly initializing `msg_namelen` before returning to user space, which caused an uninitialized memory leak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper initialization of msg_namelen",
       "Information Leakage"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory due to uninitialized data being leaked via msg_namelen.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation through a crafted application making use of recvmsg, recvfrom, or recvmmsg system calls with appletalk sockets."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user with the ability to call the vulnerable syscalls"
  }
}
