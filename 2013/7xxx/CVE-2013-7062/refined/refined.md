The provided content relates to CVE-2013-7062.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from two separate instances of reflexive Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within Zope:
1.  **browser_id_manager:** Zope's session infrastructure has a method for encoding URLs accessible through the web. This method doesn't sanitize input, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary HTML.
2.  **OFS.Image:** Zope's image objects have a method for generating tags, which allow for inclusion of arbitrary classes. This method is accessible through the web, and these classes are not sanitized, allowing for arbitrary HTML injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   Reflexive XSS in both `browser_id_manager` and `OFS.Image`.
-   Lack of input sanitization in methods accessible via the web.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML, including malicious scripts, into a user's browser session.
- This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, information theft, and website defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By passing crafted HTML into the vulnerable methods accessible through the web, attackers can trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- This usually involves enticing users to click a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to craft malicious URLs or other requests containing malicious HTML.
- No special user privileges are required, as the vulnerabilities can be exploited via web requests.
