Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft XMLDOM in Internet Explorer handles external entities defined in a Document Type Definition (DTD) when parsing XML. Specifically, it exposes information about the local file system and network by revealing different error messages based on the accessibility of the provided path in the DTD.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure via Error Messages:** The core issue is that the XMLDOM object reveals different error messages depending on the existence and accessibility of a file or directory when processing a DTD with external entities. This allows an attacker to probe the file system and network.
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Processing:** The vulnerability occurs due to the vulnerable processing of external entities, a classic characteristic of XXE vulnerabilities.
*   **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** Instead of providing generic error messages, the XMLDOM object outputs specific error messages, making it vulnerable to the exploitation of this information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File System Probing:** Attackers can determine the existence of files and directories on the user's local machine.
*   **Network Share Discovery:** Attackers can detect the presence of network shares and internal network addresses.
*   **Internal Website Detection:**  Attackers can discover internal websites or services by sending HTTP requests to local sites.
*   **Denial of Service:** XMLDOM is also vulnerable to Denial of Service by supplying a large DTD, consuming system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XML Injection:** The primary attack vector is via XML injection, where an attacker manipulates the DTD in the XML document.
*   **Specifically crafted DTD:** By manipulating the SYSTEM identifier in the DTD, attackers can specify local file paths, network paths, or local websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Client-Side Execution:** This vulnerability is client-side and requires the victim to open a malicious page in Internet Explorer where the vulnerable XML parsing is taking place.
*   **Ability to Control XML Input:** Attackers need to be able to inject their own XML with a malicious DTD to trigger this vulnerability.

**Specific techniques described in the blog post:**

*   **File System Enumeration:**
    *   Using `file://`, `\\127.0.0.1`, and `\\localhost` protocols to detect files and folders.
    *   Using NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS) to differentiate between valid directories and files.
    *   Using `res://` protocol to detect files in drives other than `C:`.
    *   Using drive letters directly (e.g. `c:\`, `d:\`) to detect available drives.
*   **Network Enumeration:**
    *   Using `http://` to send requests to local IP addresses or hostnames and detect valid network addresses.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is specific to Internet Explorer (IE) due to its use of the ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLDOM."
*   The author states that while the immediate impact is low, the research provides valuable vectors for finding and exploiting similar XML vulnerabilities in other contexts, such as in Java.
*  A proof of concept page is provided in the blog post for testing the described techniques.
