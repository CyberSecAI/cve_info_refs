Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7381:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a result of using `child_process.exec` instead of `child_process.execFile` in the `libnotify.notify` function of the `node-libnotify` module. The `exec` function executes a command in a subshell which makes the command susceptible to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The `libnotify.notify` function constructs the command to execute using user-provided input such as `msg`, `options.title`, `options.image`, `options.time`, `options.category`, `options.urgency` without proper sanitization. This makes it possible to inject arbitrary commands by manipulating any of these values.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious shell commands that will be executed on the server/machine that is running the vulnerable `node-libnotify` module. This could lead to a wide range of attacks, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `libnotify.notify` function which accepts user-provided input for message content and notification options. 
- By crafting a malicious input value and passing it as part of notification parameters, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.
- The `node-libnotify` module is intended for use in Node.js applications, and therefore attackers must be able to provide input to an application that uses the vulnerable module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is passed to the `libnotify.notify` function of the `node-libnotify` module. This could involve direct manipulation or by exploiting an application that uses the module and allows arbitrary input to be passed to this function.

**Additional details:**

- The provided github commit shows the fix for this vulnerability which replaces `child_process.exec` with `child_process.execFile`, which takes the command and arguments separately, therefore preventing command injection.
- The openwall.com content confirms the CVE assignment and references the original Node Security Project advisory for the vulnerability.
