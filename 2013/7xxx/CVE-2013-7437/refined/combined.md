| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=955808#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-04-23 22:08:48 UTC  ``` Murray McAllister of the Red Hat Security Response Team reported the following potential vulnerability in potrace:   There is a possible issue in potrace-1.11-1.fc18.x86_64.

Hi Moritz,
here is my analysis of the problem in a form of a patch.

tl;dr; -> (a) casting from unsigned int to int is tricky
          (b) product of two ints may overflow

It fixes all the cases attached in the RedHat's bugzilla, but
a review of the code by another person is advised.

Cheers,
Tomasz

Hi again (!),

I figured out that this will not work on architectures where
sizeof(long int) != 8 and/or sizeof(size_t) != 8, i386 for example.

The *next* patch makes sure that numbers passed to malloc() are not
overflowing size_t, and also uses *unsigned long long int* everywhere
which is guaranteed to be at least 64bit. Tested on both amd64 and
i386.

Bartosz,
it's been almost a month. Can you please upload a fixed package?

Hi all,
Moritz - did you take a look at my patch? I'd really like to have a
second opinion on that since it is fairly large for an NMU.

I attach NMU patch. Shall I upload it to DELAYED/5 or something like
that?

Cheers,
Tomasz

I contacted upstream and he's willing to fix it in a different way.
He said that he should be able to work on it later this week.

Here's the patch that I am planning to apply upstream. Please comment
if you see anything wrong with it.

While the general idea is similar to Tomasz's patch, I've solved the
details a bit differently.

* I prefer to use ssize_t instead of unsigned long long int for memory
  manipulations. Since size_t is the type used by malloc, memcpy, etc,
  it is big enough to hold the relevant values. The reason I use a
  signed rather than unsigned type is that the "dy" field in the
  potrace_bitmap_s structure may be positive or negative, depending on
  whether the bitmap is stored top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top. Potrace
  itself always uses a positive dy, but other applications that link
  against the Potrace library may use their own convention. Tomasz's
  patch used an unsigned type which would break applications that use
  a negative dy.

  The code now checks that the bitmap dimensions are indeed such that
  all relevant values fit within ssize_t. A remaining assumption is
  that ssize_t is at least as big as int, which I think is guaranteed.

* I prefer to use calloc instead of safe_malloc. Calloc is appropriate
  whenever the memory to be allocated is a number of copies of items
  of a given size. Unlike malloc(x*y), calloc(x, y) actually checks
  that x*y does not overflow. (I checked the glibc source code for
  calloc to be sure that such a check is actually performed). In the
  few cases where the argument of malloc is calculated differently
  (say as a product of three numbers), I have added an explicit
  overflow check. This is safer, in my opinion, than safe_malloc(x*y);
  in particular, there is no difference bewteen safe_malloc and
  ordinary malloc when size_t = unsigned long long int.

* I also fixed analogous issues in Mkbitmap and throughout the rest of
  the code.

I'll post an updated upstream package in a day or two unless there's
feedback requiring additional changes.

Thanks, -- Peter

Hey Peter,

I'm fine with your version of patch and noone else had objections so I
believe we can patch it your way.

Did you fix it upstream? I'm still seeing 1.11 as the latest release.
I can patch it only for Debian but I believe we should have it fixed for
every other distros / ways of distribution.

regards
Bartek

Hi,
there is 1.12 available (but the patch above solves
the problem as well).

Bartosz, can you please upload a fixed package to unstable?

Thanks first of all for fixing [CVE-2013-7437](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7437) in unstable. I just have
the concern, that this fix will not be accepted anymore to jessie, we
are ~1 week away from the release, and I guess the release team will
not te too happy to unblock this. Can we extract from it only the
actual changes needed to fix [CVE-2013-7437](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7437)?

Regards,
Salvatore

Good news, was unblocked:

potrace (1.11-2 to 1.12-1)
    Maintainer: Bartosz Fenski
    Too young, only 0 of 2 days old
    Ignoring block request by freeze, due to unblock request by nthykier
    Updating potrace fixes old bugs: #778646
    Not considered

Regards,
Salvatore
