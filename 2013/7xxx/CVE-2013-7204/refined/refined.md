{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of CSRF protection in the `/set_users.cgi` endpoint which allows creation and modification of users in the camera web interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious attacker can create arbitrary users, including administrator accounts, on the vulnerable camera's web interface.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious web page controlled by the attacker. This page contains an image tag that sends a crafted GET request to the vulnerable camera's `/set_users.cgi` endpoint, creating the attacker's desired user.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a way to make the camera administrator visit an attacker-controlled website and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint. The administrator must already be logged into the camera's web interface for the attack to succeed."
