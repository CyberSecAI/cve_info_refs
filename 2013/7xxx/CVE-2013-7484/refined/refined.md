Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the MD5 hashing algorithm to store user passwords in the "users" table within Zabbix. MD5 is considered cryptographically broken and unsuitable for password hashing. Furthermore, the passwords were not salted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Hashing Algorithm:** The use of MD5, a weak and outdated hashing algorithm.
- **Lack of Salt:** The absence of a salt makes rainbow table attacks feasible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised User Credentials:** An attacker who gains access to the password hashes could easily crack them, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Potential System Compromise:** Depending on the user's permissions, an attacker could potentially compromise the entire Zabbix system and monitored infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Database Access:**  An attacker who gains access to the Zabbix database can obtain the unsalted MD5 password hashes.
- **Rainbow Table Attacks:** Precomputed rainbow tables can be used to reverse the MD5 hashes and retrieve the original passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Zabbix database:** The attacker needs to gain access to the database where the user credentials are stored.
- **Computational resources:** To crack the MD5 hashes using rainbow tables or other brute-force techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in Zabbix before version 4.4.0alpha2.
- The issue was addressed in later versions by switching to stronger password hashing algorithms, as mentioned in the related ZBXNEXT-1898 ticket.
- The provided Debian LTS advisory (DLA 3538-1) includes CVE-2013-7484 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the update for Zabbix.
