## Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol does not specify unique LSA lookup identifiers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#229804

Original Release Date: 2013-08-02 | Last Revised: 2013-12-06

---

### Overview

The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol does not specify unique Link State Advertisement (LSA) lookup identifiers, which allow an attacker to intercept traffic or conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### Description

| [**CWE-694**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/694.html)**: Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier**  The OSPF protocol requires LSA's to be identified by: LS Type, Advertising Router, and Link State ID. However, during the routing table calculation phase, the specification states that a LSA is queried in the LSA database using only the Link State ID. Since the Link State ID is used in the LSA database to identify a particular router, a malformed duplicate entry can cause unexpected and insecure implementation-specific behavior.In some implementations, the vulnerability can allow an attacker to subvert the routing table of victim router by sending false link state advertisements on behalf of other routers. This subversion can cause the victim router to drop the entire table (denial of service) or to re-route traffic on the network. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability can allow an attacker to re-route traffic, compromising the confidentiality of the data, or to conduct a denial-of-service attack against a router, dropping all traffic. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Install Updates**The OSPF protocol is a popular interior routing protocol that is used by many devices and manufacturers. This vulnerability is implementation-specific, so some vendors may not be affected. The list below contains known affected or non-affected vendors. Please consult your network equipment vendor to confirm how they are affected by this vulnerability. |

BULLETIN OVERVIEW
A security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This
vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3 and is documented in the National Vulnerability Database as
CVE-2013-0149. See <http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm> for details.

Brocade produces and publishes Technical Support Bulletins to OEMs, partners and customers that
have a direct, entitled, support relationship in place with Brocade

Please contact your primary service provider for further information regarding this topic and
applicability for your environment.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
A security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This
vulnerability requires that the attacker already controls a router within the AS.

RISK ASSESSMENT
The listed products are exposed to this vulnerability in the OSPF protocol, where the attacker already
has control of a router in the AS. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3.

SYMPTOMS
An attacker who has gained control of a router within a given AS can arbitrarily poison the routing
tables of all other routers in the AS. This can facilitate traffic subversion, black hole, etc.
The attacker can cause attacks through a crafted illegal OSPF router LSA (type-1); where the link state
ID & router ID in the LSA is not same; leading to corruption of routing table in the routers.
The crafted Router LSA must come from a source IP of an OSPF peer; in other words, spoofing a
legitimate OSPF peer. OR the router LSA is sent in the interface where an OSPF peer is existing
already.

WORKAROUND
There is no workaround. However if users can physically secure their network/routers, the chance of
this attack is quite low.
The recommendations are:
a) Physically secure the access to network routers, and links between routers.
b) Only allow passive OSPF protocols on interfaces with user/host connections, (i.e. leaf
interfaces).
c) Enable OSPF MD5 authentication
This is not considered completely secure, but it should make the attack more difficult.

1.Advisory Information

Title: Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol does not specify unique LSA lookup identifiers
D-Link ID: DLINK-2013-VUL0213
Advisory URL: TBD prior to Aug. 1, 2013
Date published: August 1, 2013
Date of last update: 7/29/13 (will update on saving document)
Reported by: CERT
Release mode: Coordinated Release

2.Vulnerability Information
Class: CWE-694
Impact: Critical
Remotely Exploitable: Possible, but would require access via other product (s)
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-0149
3.Vulnerability Description
The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol does not specify unique Link State
Advertisement (LSA) lookup identifiers, which allow an attacker to intercept traffic or
conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

This vulnerability can allow an attacker to re-route traffic through their own router,
compromising the confidentiality of the data, or to conduct a Denial of Service attack
against a router, dropping all traffic.

4.Vulnerable Packages
The following is the list of known affected devices and the associated firmware
(confirmed by D-Link). This will be updated as needed if additional units effected.
1. DES-3810-28 – R2.20.B017 (HW Not available in the US)

5.VendorInformation, Solutions and Workarounds
D-Link distributes a number of devices which could potentially be affected by this
vulnerability; chiefly, any L3 managed switch that supports OSPF has the possibility of
being subject to this attack.

D-Link is working to reduce the potential impact of this vulnerability, which is a result of
an ambiguous standard. Currently we advise the following:

As always, adhering to best practices will be the strongest defense against attacks. As
long as your physical devices, networks, and protocols are secured, it will be very
difficult for an attacker to insert a rogue LSA to initiate this type of attack.

First, this vulnerability does not defeat cryptographic (MD5) authentication, we
recommend a strong MD5 authentication key as your best defense.
We also recommend that administrators enable the OSPF passive interface feature to
stop sending or receiving routing table updates on interfaces that do not participate in
OSPF.

Finally, we recommend that networks use MAC-based Access Control (MAC) to
authenticate devices before they are able to communicate with the network. The MAC
feature is a client-less design so there is no need to install extra software on a user’s
computer, and ensures that only devices on a whitelist will have access to the network.
When used in conjunction with common security best practices, it can help to strongly
limit the possible vectors of attack.

D-Link is monitoring the situation for an update to the standard that can be implemented
to protect potentially affected devices.

7.Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1.OSPF 𠇏ight Back” is triggered by LSAs with matching Router ID only, and so can
be evaded by using non matching Router ID and Link State ID on a rogue LSA. Routing
lookup uses only the Link State ID field, and so may, depending on implementation,
result in selecting the rogue LSA before the valid LSA.

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

LEGACY ADVISORY ID:

PSN-2013-08-987

PRODUCT AFFECTED:
All Juniper Networks platforms running Junos Operating System software, JunosE Operating System software, and ScreenOS software

PROBLEM:
 A vulnerability has been discovered in the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol that allows a remote attacker to insert, update, or delete routes in the OSPF database. Juniper has worked to provide fixes for all supported code that is vulnerable to this issue.

The issue lies in the OSPF protocol (RFC 2328: <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt>). OSPF does not specify that the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields need to match when a router receives an OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA). This limitation of the protocol specification would allow for an attacker to inject false routes into the OSPF database. This issue doesn't exist if the OSPF configuration of a router is set to use MD5 Authentication, or if a filter is used to block external parties from sending OSPF link-state update (LSU) packets. This issue also does not apply to passive OSPF interfaces or interfaces that are not configured for OSPF.

This issue was discovered by an external security researcher.

No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2013-0149.

SOLUTION:
Releases containing (or will contain) the fix specifically include: 13.1R3, 13.2X50-D10, 12.3R3, 12.2R5, 12.1R7, 12.1X45-D10, 12.1X44-D15, 11.4R8, 10.4R15, and all subsequent releases. In addition, all Junos OS software releases built on or after 2013-07-25 will also have fixed this specific issue.

Customers can confirm the build date of any Junos OS release by issuing the command 'show version detail'.

All JunosE software releases built on or after 2013-07-25 have fixed this specific issue. Please contact JTAC to request a patch or hotfix for fixes on all other supported releases of code.

Software updates to ScreenOS have been released to resolve this issue. Releases containing the fix include ScreenOS 5.4.0r28a, 6.2.0r17a, and 6.3.0r14a.

This issue is being tracked as PR 878639 (Junos), CQ95773 (JunosE), and PR 895456 (ScreenOS).

KB16765 - "In which releases are vulnerabilities fixed?" describes which release vulnerabilities are fixed as per our End of Engineering and End of Life support policies.

WORKAROUND:
Juniper recommends that customers use MD5 authentication when configuring OSPF. MD5 authentication completely mitigates this issue as the router will not accept an LSA without the correct MD5 auth value.

It is good security practice to limit the exploitable attack surface of critical infrastructure networking equipment. Use access lists or firewall filters on physical interfaces (not loopback) to limit access to the router via OSPF unless necessary.

Customers can request a hotfix for this issue on JunosE may do so by contacting JTAC.

CVE-2013-0149

CVSS SCORE:
7.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:C)

RISK LEVEL:
High

RISK ASSESSMENT:
This issue could allow an remote attacker the ability to modify an OSPF database. For the issue to take place the attacker would need to have unfiltered access to an OSPF interface that is not using MD5 authentication. The attacker would be able to add routes, overwrite routes, and also clear the OSPF database. This attack could potentially allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or reroute traffic.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
 Juniper SIRT would like to acknowledge and thank Gabi Nakibly for responsibly reporting this vulnerability to CERT/CC who coordinated the multi-vendor response.

## Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol does not specify unique LSA lookup identifiers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#229804

Original Release Date: 2013-08-02 | Last Revised: 2013-12-06

---

### Overview

The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol does not specify unique Link State Advertisement (LSA) lookup identifiers, which allow an attacker to intercept traffic or conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

### Description

| [**CWE-694**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/694.html)**: Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier**  The OSPF protocol requires LSA's to be identified by: LS Type, Advertising Router, and Link State ID. However, during the routing table calculation phase, the specification states that a LSA is queried in the LSA database using only the Link State ID. Since the Link State ID is used in the LSA database to identify a particular router, a malformed duplicate entry can cause unexpected and insecure implementation-specific behavior.In some implementations, the vulnerability can allow an attacker to subvert the routing table of victim router by sending false link state advertisements on behalf of other routers. This subversion can cause the victim router to drop the entire table (denial of service) or to re-route traffic on the network. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability can allow an attacker to re-route traffic, compromising the confidentiality of the data, or to conduct a denial-of-service attack against a router, dropping all traffic. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Install Updates**The OSPF protocol is a popular interior routing protocol that is used by many devices and manufacturers. This vulnerability is implementation-specific, so some vendors may not be affected. The list below contains known affected or non-affected vendors. Please consult your network equipment vendor to confirm how they are affected by this vulnerability. |

BULLETIN OVERVIEW
A security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This
vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3 and is documented in the National Vulnerability Database as
CVE-2013-0149. See <http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm> for details.

Brocade produces and publishes Technical Support Bulletins to OEMs, partners and customers that
have a direct, entitled, support relationship in place with Brocade

Please contact your primary service provider for further information regarding this topic and
applicability for your environment.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
A security vulnerability, US-CERT Ref VU#229804, has been identified in the OSPF protocol. This
vulnerability requires that the attacker already controls a router within the AS.

RISK ASSESSMENT
The listed products are exposed to this vulnerability in the OSPF protocol, where the attacker already
has control of a router in the AS. This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.3.

SYMPTOMS
An attacker who has gained control of a router within a given AS can arbitrarily poison the routing
tables of all other routers in the AS. This can facilitate traffic subversion, black hole, etc.
The attacker can cause attacks through a crafted illegal OSPF router LSA (type-1); where the link state
ID & router ID in the LSA is not same; leading to corruption of routing table in the routers.
The crafted Router LSA must come from a source IP of an OSPF peer; in other words, spoofing a
legitimate OSPF peer. OR the router LSA is sent in the interface where an OSPF peer is existing
already.

WORKAROUND
There is no workaround. However if users can physically secure their network/routers, the chance of
this attack is quite low.
The recommendations are:
a) Physically secure the access to network routers, and links between routers.
b) Only allow passive OSPF protocols on interfaces with user/host connections, (i.e. leaf
interfaces).
c) Enable OSPF MD5 authentication
This is not considered completely secure, but it should make the attack more difficult.

1.Advisory Information

Title: Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol does not specify unique LSA lookup identifiers
D-Link ID: DLINK-2013-VUL0213
Advisory URL: TBD prior to Aug. 1, 2013
Date published: August 1, 2013
Date of last update: 7/29/13 (will update on saving document)
Reported by: CERT
Release mode: Coordinated Release

2.Vulnerability Information
Class: CWE-694
Impact: Critical
Remotely Exploitable: Possible, but would require access via other product (s)
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-0149
3.Vulnerability Description
The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol does not specify unique Link State
Advertisement (LSA) lookup identifiers, which allow an attacker to intercept traffic or
conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

This vulnerability can allow an attacker to re-route traffic through their own router,
compromising the confidentiality of the data, or to conduct a Denial of Service attack
against a router, dropping all traffic.

4.Vulnerable Packages
The following is the list of known affected devices and the associated firmware
(confirmed by D-Link). This will be updated as needed if additional units effected.
1. DES-3810-28 – R2.20.B017 (HW Not available in the US)

5.VendorInformation, Solutions and Workarounds
D-Link distributes a number of devices which could potentially be affected by this
vulnerability; chiefly, any L3 managed switch that supports OSPF has the possibility of
being subject to this attack.

D-Link is working to reduce the potential impact of this vulnerability, which is a result of
an ambiguous standard. Currently we advise the following:

As always, adhering to best practices will be the strongest defense against attacks. As
long as your physical devices, networks, and protocols are secured, it will be very
difficult for an attacker to insert a rogue LSA to initiate this type of attack.

First, this vulnerability does not defeat cryptographic (MD5) authentication, we
recommend a strong MD5 authentication key as your best defense.
We also recommend that administrators enable the OSPF passive interface feature to
stop sending or receiving routing table updates on interfaces that do not participate in
OSPF.

Finally, we recommend that networks use MAC-based Access Control (MAC) to
authenticate devices before they are able to communicate with the network. The MAC
feature is a client-less design so there is no need to install extra software on a user’s
computer, and ensures that only devices on a whitelist will have access to the network.
When used in conjunction with common security best practices, it can help to strongly
limit the possible vectors of attack.

D-Link is monitoring the situation for an update to the standard that can be implemented
to protect potentially affected devices.

7.Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code

7.1.OSPF 𠇏ight Back” is triggered by LSAs with matching Router ID only, and so can
be evaded by using non matching Router ID and Link State ID on a rogue LSA. Routing
lookup uses only the Link State ID field, and so may, depending on implementation,
result in selecting the rogue LSA before the valid LSA.

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

LEGACY ADVISORY ID:

PSN-2013-08-987

PRODUCT AFFECTED:
All Juniper Networks platforms running Junos Operating System software, JunosE Operating System software, and ScreenOS software

PROBLEM:
 A vulnerability has been discovered in the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol that allows a remote attacker to insert, update, or delete routes in the OSPF database. Juniper has worked to provide fixes for all supported code that is vulnerable to this issue.

The issue lies in the OSPF protocol (RFC 2328: <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2328.txt>). OSPF does not specify that the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields need to match when a router receives an OSPF link-state advertisement (LSA). This limitation of the protocol specification would allow for an attacker to inject false routes into the OSPF database. This issue doesn't exist if the OSPF configuration of a router is set to use MD5 Authentication, or if a filter is used to block external parties from sending OSPF link-state update (LSU) packets. This issue also does not apply to passive OSPF interfaces or interfaces that are not configured for OSPF.

This issue was discovered by an external security researcher.

No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2013-0149.

SOLUTION:
Releases containing (or will contain) the fix specifically include: 13.1R3, 13.2X50-D10, 12.3R3, 12.2R5, 12.1R7, 12.1X45-D10, 12.1X44-D15, 11.4R8, 10.4R15, and all subsequent releases. In addition, all Junos OS software releases built on or after 2013-07-25 will also have fixed this specific issue.

Customers can confirm the build date of any Junos OS release by issuing the command 'show version detail'.

All JunosE software releases built on or after 2013-07-25 have fixed this specific issue. Please contact JTAC to request a patch or hotfix for fixes on all other supported releases of code.

Software updates to ScreenOS have been released to resolve this issue. Releases containing the fix include ScreenOS 5.4.0r28a, 6.2.0r17a, and 6.3.0r14a.

This issue is being tracked as PR 878639 (Junos), CQ95773 (JunosE), and PR 895456 (ScreenOS).

KB16765 - "In which releases are vulnerabilities fixed?" describes which release vulnerabilities are fixed as per our End of Engineering and End of Life support policies.

WORKAROUND:
Juniper recommends that customers use MD5 authentication when configuring OSPF. MD5 authentication completely mitigates this issue as the router will not accept an LSA without the correct MD5 auth value.

It is good security practice to limit the exploitable attack surface of critical infrastructure networking equipment. Use access lists or firewall filters on physical interfaces (not loopback) to limit access to the router via OSPF unless necessary.

Customers can request a hotfix for this issue on JunosE may do so by contacting JTAC.

CVE-2013-0149

CVSS SCORE:
7.8 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:C)

RISK LEVEL:
High

RISK ASSESSMENT:
This issue could allow an remote attacker the ability to modify an OSPF database. For the issue to take place the attacker would need to have unfiltered access to an OSPF interface that is not using MD5 authentication. The attacker would be able to add routes, overwrite routes, and also clear the OSPF database. This attack could potentially allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or reroute traffic.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
 Juniper SIRT would like to acknowledge and thank Gabi Nakibly for responsibly reporting this vulnerability to CERT/CC who coordinated the multi-vendor response.
