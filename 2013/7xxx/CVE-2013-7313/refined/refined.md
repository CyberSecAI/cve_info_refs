The provided content is related to CVE-2013-7313. Although the CVE ID in the provided content is listed as CVE-2013-0149, it is the same vulnerability as CVE-2013-7313 as mentioned in the text. This is confirmed by the description matching the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-7313.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OSPF protocol does not require the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields in an LSA to match. During routing table calculation, the LSA database is queried using only the Link State ID, which allows an attacker to inject false routing information by sending malformed LSAs with a non-matching router ID.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Use of Multiple Resources with a Duplicate Identifier (CWE-694)
  - Lack of proper validation of LSA fields (specifically, the requirement for matching 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields.)

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Subversion of routing tables, leading to traffic rerouting.
    - Denial of service (DoS) by dropping routing tables or routing traffic to a black hole.
    - Potential compromise of data confidentiality due to traffic rerouting.
    - A router may select a malicious LSA over a legitimate one depending on the implementation

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending crafted OSPF Router LSAs (type-1) with a mismatched Link State ID and Router ID.
    -  The crafted LSA needs to originate from a source IP address of a legitimate OSPF peer or be sent on an interface where an OSPF peer already exists (spoofing a legitimate OSPF peer).
    - The attacker needs to have access to the network and must either control a router within the AS or have the ability to spoof a legitimate OSPF peer.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    -  Control of a router within the Autonomous System (AS).
    -  Ability to send or inject malicious OSPF link state update packets on the network.
    -  The attacker must have unfiltered access to an OSPF interface that is not using MD5 authentication.
