Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Juvia application, a Ruby on Rails application for hosting comments, included a default secret token for validating cookies. This default secret was located in `app/config/initializers/secret_token.rb` and was part of the git repository, meaning that it was not unique per instance and was publicly available.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Secret Token:** The application shipped with a preconfigured secret token, rather than requiring each instance to generate a unique one.
- **Publicly Available Secret:** The secret token was stored in a file within the git repository, making it accessible to anyone with access to the code, which effectively renders it not secret.
- **Lack of Installation Step:** There was no step during installation to generate or replace this default secret token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could use the known default secret token to forge valid session cookies.
- **Session Tampering:** With the ability to create valid session cookies, an attacker could modify session state and potentially gain unauthorized access or control of the application and its users.
- **General Application Trust Issues:** Because the application trusts the session data based on the secret key, a compromised secret key allows a wide range of attacks related to application logic.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Knowledge of the Default Secret:** The primary attack vector is that the secret token is publicly available in the git repository. An attacker only needs to obtain the source code to extract the secret.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Source Code:** The attacker needs access to the Juvia source code, specifically the `app/config/initializers/secret_token.rb` file, where the default secret token is stored.
- **Knowledge of Session Handling:** The attacker needs some familiarity with how session management works in Rails applications to exploit the forged cookies.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported to the Rails security team because the default file generation process in Rails contributed to the problem.
- A workaround is to generate a new secret (`rake secret`) and replace the default one in `app/config/initializers/secret_token.rb`. However, this needs to be done carefully during branch switching to avoid losing the change.
