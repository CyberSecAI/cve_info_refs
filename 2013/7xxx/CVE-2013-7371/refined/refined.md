Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-7371:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an incomplete fix for a previous XSS vulnerability (CVE-2013-7370) in the `methodOverride` middleware of the Sencha Labs Connect library for Node.js.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `methodOverride` middleware was vulnerable to XSS attacks due to insufficient sanitization of the HTTP method name. The initial fix in version 2.8.1 addressed some characters, but not all that could be used for XSS.
- **Incomplete Fix:** The initial fix (CVE-2013-7370) only addressed specific characters (`<`, `>`, `"`) used in XSS attacks, leaving other vectors open.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the user's browser. This code can then be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or perform other nefarious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request with Crafted Method Name:** The vulnerability is triggered by an HTTP request containing a specially crafted method name containing JavaScript.
- **Method Override Middleware:** The vulnerable code is in the `methodOverride` middleware of the Connect library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the server running the vulnerable Connect middleware.
- **Understanding of HTTP methods and XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request with a malicious method name that bypasses the initial fix.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of Sencha Labs Connect middleware before 2.8.2 for Node.js
- The vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7370. The initial fix in version 2.8.1 of Connect only sanitized certain characters, but did not consider that other characters could be used to execute JavaScript.
- The fix for this CVE was introduced in version 2.8.2 of the Connect middleware.
