Severity Level:
===============
High

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official DELL SonicWall GMS v7.1.x Appliance
Web-Application.
The bug allows an attacker (remote) to implement/inject own malicious malicious script codes on the application-side
(persistent).

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `valfield_1` & `value_1` value parameters of the `Alert Settings` module
POST method request.
Remote attackers with low privileged application user account can inject own script codes to the POST method request of
the createNewThreshold.jsp
appliance application file. After the inject the attacker is able to update and save the values to continue with the
execute the main alert
settings module. The execute of the script code occurs in the ematStaticAlertTypes.jsp file context by the earlier
manipulated vulnerable values.

To bypass the filter it is required to split the request by attaching a double frame for the script code execute. The
restricted application itself
disallows the POST request of guest by usage of the unrestricted context POST method request attackers are able to
bypass the filter & exception-handling.

The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as high(-) with a cvss (common
vulnerability scoring system)
count of 4.1(+). The coordinated disclosure procedure of the remote vulnerability has been navigated by the product
manager Wilson Lee (DELL).
The hotfix and information has been provided in cooperation with the vulnerability-laboratory.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a local low privileged (guest) web
application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal via
persistent web attacks,
persistent phishing or persistent manipulation of vulnerable module context.

Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged or
restricted guest accounts and
low user interaction. For security demonstration or reproduce the vulnerability follow the information and steps below.

Location: Alert Settings
[http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/panelManager?panelidz=1&level=1&typeOfUnits=0#](http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/panelManager?panelidz=1&level=1&typeOfUnits=0)

Inject via Add: Edit contents for alert type: Backed-Up Syslog Files
<http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/ematStaticAlertTypes.jsp>?

Execute: Create New Threshold
<http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/createNewThreshold.jsp>?

Affected:
<http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/auth>

Manual steps to reproduce ...

1.  Open the Sonicwall GMS appliance application and login with full restrictions as guest
2.  Switch to the vulnerable Console > Events > Alert Settings section
3.  Click Add Alert and a new blank window of the application will be opened
4.  Click in the upcomings window in the Alert Types section the Edit Content link
5.  Now, a new window opens "Edit contents for alert type: Backup Sys-Log Files
6.  On top is a little plus button next to the Threshold value
9.  A new window opens with Elements box ... Inject your payload (script code) to the description eval in the operator
fields
10. After the inject to the input fields the attacker only needs to click the Add Element button on the buttom of the
page
11. The code will be directly executed and is persistent saved as element in the specific section
12. Save the input via update and go back to the alert settings main section were the code execute occurs in the same
connected value
13. Successful reproduced!

The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse, prevention filter mechanism or clean encode of the vulnerable
value_1 and valfield_1 parameters.
Also restrict and escape the affected input field and output listing in the connected modules.

Resolution (DELL SonicWall):
We recommend existing users of Dell SonicWALL GMS/Analyzer/UMA 7.1 to apply SP1 (if they have not already done so), and
then apply Hotfix 134235 to prevent cross-site scripting by unauthorized users. 7.1 SP1 and the Hotfix are available
for download from www.mysonicwall.com. Users should log into mySonicWALL and click on Downloads > Download Center in
the navigation panel on the left, then select “GMS/Analyzer” in the Software Type drop down menu.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Product: GMS Networks Appliance Application 7.1

Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote

Severity Level:
===============
High

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official DELL SonicWall GMS v7.1.x Appliance Web-Application.
The bug allows an attacker (remote) to implement/inject own malicious malicious script codes on the application-side (persistent).

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `valfield_1` & `value_1` value parameters of the `Alert Settings` module POST method request.
Remote attackers with low privileged application user account can inject own script codes to the POST method request of the createNewThreshold.jsp
appliance application file. After the inject the attacker is able to update and save the values to continue with the execute the main alert
settings module. The execute of the script code occurs in the ematStaticAlertTypes.jsp file context by the earlier manipulated vulnerable values.

To bypass the filter it is required to split the request by attaching a double frame for the script code execute. The restricted application itself
disallows the POST request of guest by usage of the unrestricted context POST method request attackers are able to bypass the filter & exception-handling.

The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as high(-) with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system)
count of 4.1(+). The coordinated disclosure procedure of the remote vulnerability has been navigated by the product manager Wilson Lee (DELL).
The hotfix and information has been provided in cooperation with the vulnerability-laboratory.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a local low privileged (guest) web application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal via persistent web attacks,
persistent phishing or persistent manipulation of vulnerable module context.

The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged or restricted guest accounts and
low user interaction. For security demonstration or reproduce the vulnerability follow the information and steps below.

Location: Alert Settings
http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/panelManager?panelidz=1&level=1&typeOfUnits=0#

Inject via Add: Edit contents for alert type: Backed-Up Syslog Files
http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/ematStaticAlertTypes.jsp?

Execute: Create New Threshold
http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/createNewThreshold.jsp?

Affected:
http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/auth

Manual steps to reproduce ...

1.  Open the Sonicwall GMS appliance application and login with full restrictions as guest
2.  Switch to the vulnerable Console > Events > Alert Settings section
3.  Click Add Alert and a new blank window of the application will be opened
4.  Click in the upcomings window in the Alert Types section the Edit Content link
5.  Now, a new window opens "Edit contents for alert type: Backup Sys-Log Files
6.  On top is a little plus button next to the Threshold value
9.  A new window opens with Elements box ... Inject your payload (script code) to the description eval in the operator fields
10. After the inject to the input fields the attacker only needs to click the Add Element button on the buttom of the page
11. The code will be directly executed and is persistent saved as element in the specific section
12. Save the input via update and go back to the alert settings main section were the code execute occurs in the same connected value
13. Successful reproduced!

Note: Please, feel free to read also the patch information provided in the solution section of the advisory document.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse, prevention filter mechanism or clean encode of the vulnerable value_1 and valfield_1 parameters.
Also restrict and escape the affected input field and output listing in the connected modules.

Resolution (DELL SonicWall):
We recommend existing users of Dell SonicWALL GMS/Analyzer/UMA 7.1 to apply SP1 (if they have not already done so), and then apply Hotfix 134235 to prevent cross-site scripting by unauthorized users. 7.1 SP1 and the Hotfix are available for download from www.mysonicwall.com. Users should log into mySonicWALL and click on Downloads > Download Center in the navigation panel on the left, then select “GMS/Analyzer” in the Software Type drop down menu.

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability with filter bypass is estimated as medium(+).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
