{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The JForum Admin module lacks proper CSRF protection in the user permissions modification functionality.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can escalate the privileges of a user to an administrator group by tricking an administrator into loading a crafted URL.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when loaded by an authenticated administrator, modifies user permissions. This is done via an `<img>` tag embedded in a forum post.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to post content to the JForum, and trick a logged-in administrator into viewing the malicious post. The attacker needs to know the user ID of the target user and the group ID of the target administrator group."
