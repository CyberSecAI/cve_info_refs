Based on the provided content, the commit addresses Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application was missing CSRF protection, allowing attackers to potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of CSRF protection in various forms and pages across the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially perform actions as an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent. This could include:
    - Modifying data
    - Changing configurations
    - Performing financial transactions
    - Any other action that an authenticated user is permitted to perform.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploiting the vulnerability would typically involve crafting a malicious request that appears to originate from a legitimate user's browser. This could be done through:
    - Malicious websites
    - Phishing emails
    - Social engineering

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to lure an authenticated user to trigger the malicious request.
- The attacker would not need access to the server, but would need to be able to send malicious HTTP requests that would appear to come from the victim's browser.
- The attacker would need to know the structure of the requests, but these are exposed by the web app.

**Technical Details:**
- The commit introduces `CsrfTokenHandler` to handle CSRF token generation and validation.
- The changes across multiple files show how this `CsrfTokenHandler` is used and added to forms in the application:
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/admin/SetupForm.java`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/admin/SetupImportForm.java`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/admin/SetupPage.html`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/admin/SystemUpdateForm.java`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/admin/SystemUpdatePage.html`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/core/NavTopPanel.html`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/core/NavTopPanel.java`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/dialog/ModalDialog.html`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/dialog/ModalDialog.java`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/fibu/RechnungCostEditTablePanel.html`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/fibu/RechnungCostEditTablePanel.java`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/mobile/AbstractMobileEditForm.java`
  - `src/main/java/org/projectforge/web/mobile/AbstractMobileEditPage.html`

The code changes involve adding a hidden input field to forms to hold the CSRF token and then verifying this token in the `onSubmit` method of these forms. This helps protect against CSRF attacks.
