Worthless unless you want slider which display your post frow WP or your You tube video. Very big and complicated.

I spent 3 hours trying to get this to work.
Great idea and poor implementation.
More interested in getting you to the premium version than making user friendly.
The free version didn’t work at all on the YouTube portion.
Want support (plugin option) then upgrade? What kind of crap is this?
Want free testers that give you bugs? PAY ME THEN.
I really hate time wasters.
I see from the experiences below that the coder/company doesn’t comment very often on reviews which makes me think the company doesn’t care or want to solve issues. I would consider this an abandoned plugin.

I really wanted to buy this for a big project we have coming up but their website offers NO WAY to contact them with pre-sale questions.
Looks like they never reply to questions here on Wordpresss, they ignore people asking questions on their Facebook page so the only way to ask a question is to buy it first. I have 1 simple question that i needed answering before buying.
Sorry but i’m not buying from any company who works like that and no doubt i’m not alone.

With SlideDeck 2 Lite, you have no impact on creating WP SlideDecks – absolutely useless, and time wasting. In my opinion it would be honest if authors directly mention to buy personal edtion.
