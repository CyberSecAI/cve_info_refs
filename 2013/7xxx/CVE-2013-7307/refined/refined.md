The provided content is related to CVE-2013-7307. However, this CVE is a placeholder, and the provided content actually describes **CVE-2013-0149**. The content is a vulnerability note from CERT, detailing a flaw in the OSPF protocol.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The OSPF protocol specification does not enforce a requirement for the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields within a Link State Advertisement (LSA) to match. During the routing table calculation phase, the specification dictates that an LSA is queried in the LSA database using only the Link State ID, without checking the Advertising Router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of LSA identifiers in the OSPF protocol. This allows an attacker to inject malformed LSAs with non-matching Link State ID and Advertising Router fields.
- The vulnerability is a result of the OSPF specification not requiring that the 'Link State ID' and 'Advertising Router' fields match.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can subvert the routing table of a victim router.
- This can lead to traffic being rerouted through the attacker's controlled router, compromising data confidentiality.
- Alternatively, the victim router's routing table could be corrupted, causing a denial-of-service by dropping all traffic.
- Attackers can inject false routes, overwrite existing routes, or clear the OSPF database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with control over a router within the same Autonomous System (AS) can inject crafted OSPF LSAs to exploit this flaw.
- The crafted LSA must originate from a source IP of an existing OSPF peer, meaning an attacker needs to spoof a legitimate OSPF peer, or be present on an interface where an OSPF peer is already established.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control of a router within the same AS as the target router.
- The attacker must have the ability to send spoofed OSPF link-state update (LSU) packets.
- The target router must not be using OSPF MD5 authentication.
- The attack requires unfiltered access to an OSPF interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is implementation-specific, meaning not all vendors are affected.
- The vulnerability is mitigated by using OSPF MD5 authentication, as the router will not accept LSAs without the correct MD5 auth value.
- D-Link's advisory mentions that the vulnerability can be triggered by using an LSA with a non-matching Router ID and Link State ID.
