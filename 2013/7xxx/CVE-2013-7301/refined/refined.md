Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Cantata music player, by default, uses the external network interface for its internal HTTP server.
- This server lacks proper access control for reading queued music files and other files accessible to the user running the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The application's default setting uses an external network interface without access controls.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The internal HTTP server does not restrict access to files, allowing unauthorized reading.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read any file the user running Cantata has access to, not just music files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Theft:** An attacker can steal sensitive data such as private keys, passwords, and other confidential information from the user's home directory and elsewhere accessible to the user.
- **Compromise of User Data:** The attacker can potentially gain access to various user data and resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the machine running Cantata, given the default configuration listens on the external network interface.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to the Cantata's internal HTTP server to download arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the victim running Cantata.
- The attacker must know or discover the port Cantata is listening on.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is described as an "obvious mistake (or not well hidden backdoor?)" that was unexpected in the application.
- The vulnerability is present because the internal HTTP server does not properly handle requests and allows the download of any file it has access to.
-  The suggested fix is to remove the internal HTTP server altogether.
- It's noted that the most secure option without removing the server is to limit it to listening on the "lo" (loopback) interface.
- The vulnerability is related to an issue report [https://code.google.com/p/cantata/issues/detail?id=356](https://code.google.com/p/cantata/issues/detail?id=356)
