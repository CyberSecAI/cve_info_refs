Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7011:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

*   The provided content includes a commit message from FFmpeg's git repository specifically addressing "Fixes out of array (on heap) writes in ffv1 decoding", referencing the ticket #2906 which relates to CVE-2013-7011.
*   The CVE description in the provided mail confirms the usage of CVE-2013-7011 for the ffv1 decoding issue, this confirms it's relation to this CVE.
*   The Gentoo security advisory also lists CVE-2013-7011 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in FFmpeg.
    *Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2013-7011.*

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   The root cause is an out-of-bounds write within the FFV1 decoder. This occurred due to a lack of validation that global parameters don't change within version 0/1 headers. Specifically a check for equality of `bits_per_raw_sample` and colorspace was missing.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The vulnerability stems from writing data to a memory location outside of the allocated buffer for the FFV1 decoder.
*   **Missing validation:** Failure to check if the global parameters changed led to potential inconsistencies, which eventually resulted in the out-of-bounds write.
*  **Inconsistent state:** Different values of global parameters within the header leads to an inconsistent state in the decoder.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Memory corruption:** An attacker can cause memory corruption by providing a specially crafted FFV1 bitstream.
*   **Crash:** An out-of-bounds write can cause a crash due to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), as noted in the provided crash log from `gdb`. The Valgrind output also shows invalid memory writes.
*   **Potential code execution**: The advisory from Gentoo mentions the potential for arbitrary code execution, which is a potential consequence of memory corruption, although it isn't specified how this would happen.

**5. Attack Vectors**

*   The attack vector is a malicious or crafted media file, specifically an AVI file using the FFV1 codec. The provided gdb and valgrind outputs are from an input file named 'ffv1_fuzz.avi'.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **File access/delivery:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted file containing the malicious FFV1 bitstream to a vulnerable system, which could occur via user interaction or potentially through a service processing media files.

**7. Additional Information**

*   The fix specifically addresses the issue by adding a check in the header to enforce that global parameters (chroma planes, horizontal shift, vertical shift, transparency) do not change in version 0/1 headers.
*   The provided information includes crash logs from `gdb` and `valgrind`, which demonstrate the out-of-bounds write and memory corruption.
*  The commit message provides additional context: "Such changes are not allowed nor supported".
* The github content also references trac ticket #2906.
* This issue was found by "ami_stuff" according to github and ffmpeg sources, this likely represents a fuzzer.

In summary, CVE-2013-7011 is a vulnerability that could be triggered by a specially crafted FFV1 video stream that exploits a memory write error due to an oversight in the validation of global parameters in FFmpeg's FFV1 decoder.
