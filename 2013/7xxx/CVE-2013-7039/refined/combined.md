| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2013-12-06 15:31:40 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Two vulnerabilities have been reported in libmicrohttpd, where one has an unknown impact and the other one  can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially compromise an  application using the library.  1) A boundary error when unescaping strings can be exploited to trigger an out-of-bound read.  2) A boundary error when handling authentication headers can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer  overflow by providing an overly long authentication header.  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code, but requires the  application to explicitly raise memory limits and use MHD_digest_auth_check.  The vulnerabilities are reported in versions prior to 0.9.32.   Solution: Update to version 0.9.32.  Provided and/or discovered by: The vendor credits Florian Weimer.   @maintainer(s): since the fixed package is already in the tree, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Anthony Basile   gentoo-dev  2013-12-06 17:28:49 UTC  ``` *libmicrohttpd-0.9.32 (03 Dec 2013)    03 Dec 2013; Anthony G.

CVE-2013-7038 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2013-7038>):   The MHD_http_unescape function in libmicrohttpd before 0.9.32 might allow   remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of   service (crash) via unspecified vectors that trigger an out-of-bounds read. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Sergey Popov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2013-12-15 09:49:13 UTC  ``` Thanks for your work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1039390#c0)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-09 01:56:01 UTC  ``` A stack overflow flaw was found in the MHD_digest_auth_check() function in libmicrohttpd. If MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT was configured to allow large allocations, a remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to cause an application using libmicrohttpd to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. This issue has been resolved in version 0.9.32.  References: <https://gnunet.org/svn/libmicrohttpd/ChangeLog> <http://secunia.com/advisories/55903/> <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=493450>  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1039390#c2)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-09 01:57:50 UTC  ```  Created libmicrohttpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1039391](show_bug.cgi?id=1039391 "CLOSED ERRATA - libmicrohttpd: stack overflow in MHD_digest_auth_check() [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1039392](show_bug.cgi?id=1039392 "CLOSED EOL - libmicrohttpd: stack overflow in MHD_digest_auth_check() [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1039390#c3)  Murray McAllister    2013-12-09 02:06:33 UTC  ``` CVE request: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/12/09/1>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
