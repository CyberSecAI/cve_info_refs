  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2013-7039",
      "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MHD_digest_auth_check() function in libmicrohttpd before version 0.9.32. When MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT is set to a large value, a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a long URI within an authentication header. Successful exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (crash) or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.",
      "root_cause": "A boundary error in the MHD_digest_auth_check function when handling authentication headers.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (crash), potential arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote attacker sending a long URI in an authentication header.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests with a long URI within an authentication header, and the application must configure MHD_OPTION_CONNECTION_MEMORY_LIMIT to allow large allocations and use MHD_digest_auth_check."
