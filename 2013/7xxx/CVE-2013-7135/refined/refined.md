Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-7135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `Proc::Daemon` Perl module, when instructed to write a PID file, does so with a umask set to 0. This causes the created PID file to have world-writable permissions (mode 666).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of file permissions when creating the PID file.
- Specifically, the module does not respect the system's umask setting, leading to overly permissive file permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A world-writable PID file could allow any user on the system to modify the file.
- This could lead to various attacks such as:
    - Spoofing the PID of the daemon process.
    - Denial of service by causing the daemon to misbehave.
    - Other unforeseen attacks, as the PID file is used for process management.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the PID file. This could be done by local users on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable application using `Proc::Daemon` is running.
- The attacker needs to have write access to the directory containing the pid file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Christian Mock.
- A patch was created for the Debian packaging and forwarded upstream by Axel Beckert.
