Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-7205:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an off-by-one error within the `process_cgivars()` function in `contrib/daemonchk.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Off-by-one error:** The code incorrectly handles bounds checking when processing key-value pairs in the `process_cgivars()` function. This leads to an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Out-of-bounds read:**  Due to the off-by-one error, a specially crafted key-value can cause the program to read data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can cause the Nagios process to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted key-value pair to the Nagios web UI via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Nagios web interface. No authentication is mentioned as being required for exploitation, so this would likely be an unauthenticated vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**

*   The `contrib/daemonchk.c` code is not exposed to untrusted input in the default Icinga distribution, making it less of a concern in that context.
*   The `process_cgivars()` function in `contrib/daemonchk.c` doesn't appear to have any practical use, and the code could potentially be removed.
*   The related commit in `cgi/statuswml.c` does not address a security issue, but was made for consistency reasons.
