  "CVE-2013-7260": {
    "description": "RealPlayer version 16.0.3.51 and possibly earlier versions contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The .RMP file format is similar to standard XML encoding. An attacker can place malicious code in the value of the version or the encoding attributes inside the XML declaration to craft a malicious .RMP file. Once the file is opened by the victim, the program may crash or allow execution of code.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a stack-based buffer overflow when processing the 'version' or 'encoding' attributes in the XML declaration of a .RMP file.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted .RMP file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious .RMP file with an overly long value in the 'version' or 'encoding' attributes of the XML declaration."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a malformed .RMP file. The victim must then open the file with a vulnerable version of RealPlayer.",
     "details": "The provided exploit code overwrites the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) and uses ROP gadgets to bypass DEP and execute shellcode. The overflow occurs when parsing the version attribute of the XML declaration within the .rmp file. The vulnerability can be triggered when opening the file either through a click or through the menu, with slightly different offsets needed for each case."
