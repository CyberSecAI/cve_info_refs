Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-7439:

**Root Cause:**
- An off-by-one error exists in the `MakeBigReq` and `SetReqLen` macros within the `Xlibint.h` header file of the X11 library. These macros are used to handle large requests in the X Window System.
- The error occurs when these macros calculate the memory needed to copy data, resulting in a 4-byte buffer overflow. Specifically, the code attempts to move one word too many, causing a write outside the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the boundaries of a buffer. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions.
- **Use of Internal Macros:** The issue lies within macros (`MakeBigReq`, `SetReqLen`) that are intended for internal use but are being used by various X11 extensions and third-party software, which was a bad practice.
- **Recompilation Requirement**:  The fix requires recompilation of software using the affected macros.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause applications to crash by sending crafted requests that trigger the overflow, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** The overflow *could* be exploited to execute arbitrary code by overwriting return addresses or other critical data on the stack or heap, although this is not certain, as stated in the Ubuntu security notice.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can trigger it over a network connection by sending malicious X11 requests. This includes applications such as web browsers, which may render untrusted content, as it was noted in the X.Org advisory.
- **Malicious X11 Client:** An attacker could create a malicious X11 client that sends a specially crafted request to the X server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
- **X11 Client Interaction:**  The attacker needs the ability to interact with the X server, either by creating a new X11 client, or by exploiting an existing application that uses X11.
- **Crafted X11 Request:** The attacker needs the ability to craft an X11 request that triggers the buffer overflow by providing a large request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in all versions of X11R6.x and libX11 prior to version 1.6.0.
- The fix involves correcting the memory calculation in the `MakeBigReq` macro, specifically the amount of data to be moved.
- Many libraries that relied on the internal macros needed to be recompiled to fully mitigate the vulnerability, including `libXext`, `libXfixes`, `libXi`, `libXp`, `libXrandr`, `libXrender`, `libXv`, `libXxf86misc`, and `xf86-video-vmware`.
- Ubuntu security notices state that a reboot was required after standard updates to apply the fixes.
- Debian also released security updates (DSA-3224-1) addressing this issue.

In summary, CVE-2013-7439 is a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the X11 library that could lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution, emphasizing the importance of recompiling all affected software after updating the library itself.
