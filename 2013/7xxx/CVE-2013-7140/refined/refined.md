The provided content contains information about CVE-2013-7140.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the use of a SAX builder with default values when deserializing posted XML bodies at the WebDAV interface. This makes it vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) attacks. Specifically, the CalDAV interface is susceptible to forged requests that can be used to reveal file contents stored on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability due to insecure XML parsing.
- Absolute Path Traversal vulnerability via the CalDAV interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can use forged requests against the CalDAV interface to reveal the contents of files stored on the server. This could expose sensitive data such as credentials, configuration files, or other confidential information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending forged requests to the CalDAV interface.
- Exploiting the XXE vulnerability in the SAX parser used for XML deserialization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to send requests to the CalDAV interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft forged requests.
