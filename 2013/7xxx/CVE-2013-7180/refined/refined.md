Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a weak password recovery mechanism implemented in the web interface of certain Cobham SATCOM products. The password reset algorithm can be reverse engineered, allowing attackers to generate their own reset codes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password:** The products use an insecure algorithm for password recovery, which is vulnerable to reverse engineering and exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker with access to the web interface can reset the administrator password.
*   Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the administrator account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the web interface of the affected Cobham products.
*   Exploitation is achieved through reverse engineering the password reset mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have network access to the web interface of the vulnerable Cobham device.
*   The attacker needs the ability to reverse engineer the password reset algorithm to generate valid reset codes.
*   According to the vendor, physical access to the device or maintenance part of the network is another possibility, but the primary vector is remote access to the web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vendor emphasizes that physical access to the equipment or the maintenance part of the network is often required for exploitation.
*   The vulnerability affects several Cobham products, including SAILOR 900 VSAT, SAILOR FleetBroadBand 150/250/500, EXPLORER BGAN, and AVIATOR 200/300/350/700D.
*   The provided CVSS score is 7.8 (Base score), which signifies a high severity vulnerability.
