Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from calling specific phpMyAdmin scripts in an unexpected manner. This triggers PHP to generate an error message that discloses the full path of the phpMyAdmin installation directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full path of the phpMyAdmin installation directory.
*   **Reliance on PHP Configuration:** The vulnerability's impact is amplified when the PHP configuration directive `display_errors` is set to `on`. This is against recommendations in the PHP manual.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could learn the full path of the phpMyAdmin installation directory. This information, while not directly exploitable, could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to plan more sophisticated attacks. For example, it can reveal the location of sensitive configuration files or other exploitable components.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves calling specific phpMyAdmin scripts in an unanticipated way, which results in a PHP error message revealing the installation path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable phpMyAdmin instance by sending requests to the vulnerable scripts. No specific privileges are mentioned, it is likely that no authentication is required.
*   The attacker also needs the target server to have `display_errors` set to `on` in the PHP configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered non-critical because it is a path disclosure, and requires the server to have a non-recommended PHP setting.
*   The document provides information on affected versions, solution (upgrading or applying patches), and commit links of the patches.
*   The document includes assigned CVE ids: CVE-2013-4998, CVE-2013-4999, and CVE-2013-5000, and CWE ids: CWE-661 and CWE-200.
