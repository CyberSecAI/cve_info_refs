Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how ModSecurity handles chunked requests. Specifically, the code uses a case-sensitive string comparison (`strstr`) to check for the "chunked" keyword within the `Transfer-Encoding` HTTP header.  Because HTTP header values are case-insensitive, this allowed an attacker to bypass the check by providing "Chunked" (or other variations) instead of "chunked".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Case-sensitive string comparison for the "chunked" keyword in the `Transfer-Encoding` header check. This is a violation of HTTP header case-insensitivity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By sending a crafted HTTP request with a capitalized "Chunked" value in the `Transfer-Encoding` header, an attacker can bypass ModSecurity's content inspection rules.
- This allows the attacker to send malicious payloads that ModSecurity would normally block, potentially leading to various attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to a web server protected by ModSecurity.
- The request must include a `Transfer-Encoding` header containing a capitalized or mixed-case "Chunked" value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a web server running ModSecurity.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or access beyond that of a normal user interacting with the web application.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided github commit diff shows the fix involves replacing `strstr` with a case-insensitive string search function `m_strcasestr`.
- The vulnerability is present in ModSecurity versions prior to 2.7.6.
