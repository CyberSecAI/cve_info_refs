- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Thomson Reuters Velocity Analytics Vhayu Analytic Server's file import function does not properly sanitize input, allowing for code injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Code injection (CWE-94). The software is configured to run with system privileges by default which exacerbates the issue.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can upload malicious files or execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can craft a URL that leverages the software's file import function to inject code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, no authentication is required.
