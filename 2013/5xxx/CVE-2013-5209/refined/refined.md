{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SCTP implementation in FreeBSD kernel does not fully initialize a buffer allocated on the kernel stack when creating the SCTP state cookie for INIT-ACK chunks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Kernel memory disclosure. The SCTP state cookie contains uninitialized memory, specifically two separate 4-byte fragments, which are sent over the network.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The uninitialized memory fragments in the SCTP packets may reveal sensitive information from kernel memory, potentially including file cache portions, terminal buffers (possibly containing user-entered passwords) or other data useful to gain elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "By establishing an SCTP connection with a vulnerable FreeBSD system, an attacker can receive SCTP packets containing leaked kernel memory via the uninitialized state cookie.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish an SCTP connection with the vulnerable FreeBSD system. No special privileges or local access are required."
