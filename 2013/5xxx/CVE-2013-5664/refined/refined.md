Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the web-based device management API browser. User-provided data is echoed back without proper neutralization, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically a reflected XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected into the user's browser via the vulnerable web page.
- Improper Input Handling: The root cause is the failure to sanitize or properly encode user-supplied data before it is rendered in the web page, allowing the injection of client-side script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is limited to **Integrity**, as the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the web page which can then be executed by other users. The CVSS score indicates LOW integrity impact, meaning that the attacker could potentially modify the appearance or behavior of the page.
- No Confidentiality or Availability impact is noted.
- Successful exploitation could potentially lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions performed within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is accessible over the network, as it affects the web-based device management API browser.
- The attack requires user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to interact with a specially crafted link to trigger the malicious script.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the URL or parameters sent to the vulnerable web interface.

**Affected Versions:**
- PAN-OS 4.1 versions 4.1.12 and earlier.
- PAN-OS 5.0 versions 5.0.5 and earlier.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to PAN-OS 4.1.13 or later.
- Upgrade to PAN-OS 5.0.6 or later.
- The vulnerability affects only the web-based device management API browser.
