Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5676:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Jenkins SonarQube Plugin stores the SonarQube password in plain text within the Jenkins configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Plain text storage of sensitive information (SonarQube password).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with "Manage Jenkins" privileges can obtain the plain text SonarQube credentials.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to the SonarQube instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote access via the Jenkins web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a malicious user with "Manage Jenkins" privileges within Jenkins CI.
- They must have access to the Jenkins web interface.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is found in the Jenkins SonarQube Plugin.
- It involves accessing the Jenkins configuration page (e.g., `https://jenkinsserver:9444/jenkins/configure`) and viewing the `sonar.sonarPassword` parameter in the "Sonar installations" section.
- The issue is present when the "sonar.password" property is not encrypted using SonarQube's encryption mechanism (available since SonarQube v3.7)

**Affected Systems:**
- Jenkins CI v1.523 and SonarQube Plugin v3.7 were explicitly tested and found to be vulnerable.
- Older versions are likely also affected.
