CA20131024-01: Security Notice for CA SiteMinder

Issued: October 24, 2013

CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to a potential
vulnerability in CA SiteMinder that can be mitigated by utilizing
existing product functionality. The vulnerability, CVE-2013-5968, can
potentially allow a remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
attack and execute script in the security context of the SiteMinder
domain. Customers should review their SiteMinder deployments to
verify that the vulnerability mitigating functionality is enabled.

Risk Rating

Medium

Platform

All platforms

Affected Products

CA SiteMinder 12.51
CA SiteMinder 12.5
CA SiteMinder 12.0
CA SiteMinder 6 Web Agents

How to determine if the installation is affected

Ensure cross-site scripting checking is enabled and the BadCSSChars
setting contains the hexadecimal double quote, "%22". See the solution
section for details.

Solution

CA Technologies support is referring customers to guidance provided in
the product documentation that describes how to protect against this
vulnerability.

These instructions are derived from the CA SiteMinder Web Agent
Configuration Guide 12.5. Review the sections titled "Protect Web
Sites Against Cross-Site Scripting" and "Configure the Web Agent to
Check For Cross Site-Scripting" starting on page 65 for more
information.

1. Add the hexadecimal equivalent for the double quote character,
"%22", to the BadCSSChars setting.

Example:

BadCSSChars="<,>,%22"

*Note: Setting BadCSSChars overrides the default cross-site scripting
character set. SiteMinder administrators need to carefully review the
setting to ensure all cross-site scripting characters are blocked for
their specific environment.

2. Enable cross-site scripting checking by setting CSSChecking to yes.

Example:

CSSChecking="YES"
