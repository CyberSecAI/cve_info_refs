Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient cross-site scripting (XSS) protection in CA SiteMinder Web Agents. Specifically, the software does not properly handle or block certain characters, such as the double quote ("), which can be used to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a reflected XSS vulnerability. By injecting malicious script into user input that is then reflected back to the user, an attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the security context of the SiteMinder domain. This could lead to:
  - Data theft
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of web pages
  - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Malicious Input Injection:** The attacker injects malicious script through an unspecified input field or parameter that is processed by the vulnerable web agent. The double quote character is specifically highlighted as a key component for this attack.
  
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted requests to a vulnerable SiteMinder deployment.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know which parameters can be used to inject the malicious script.

**Mitigation:**
The provided document details the recommended mitigation:

1.  **`BadCSSChars` Configuration:** Add the hexadecimal equivalent for the double quote character, "%22", to the `BadCSSChars` setting to ensure it is blocked, in addition to existing characters like "<" and ">".
2.  **`CSSChecking` Configuration:** Enable cross-site scripting checking by setting the `CSSChecking` setting to "YES".

**Additional Notes:**
- The document highlights that setting `BadCSSChars` overrides the default cross-site scripting character set, so administrators need to carefully review this setting to ensure all relevant XSS characters are blocked.
- The affected products include CA SiteMinder versions 12.51, 12.5, 12.0, and 6 Web Agents.
- The vulnerability was identified by Zachary Pritchard from Cigital.
