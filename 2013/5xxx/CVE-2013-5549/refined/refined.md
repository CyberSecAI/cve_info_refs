Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2013-5549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of fragmented packets by specific Cisco CRS (Carrier Routing System) route processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper processing of fragmented packets. This suggests a flaw in how the route processors reassemble or manage fragmented IP packets.
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco IOS XR software releases 3.3.0 to 4.2.0.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Specifically, the exploit causes packets originating on the route processor CPU to stop transmitting to the fabric, leading to a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated.
- Attackers send specially crafted fragmented packets to a vulnerable system.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- A TCP three-way handshake is not required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is not triggered by traffic traversing the vulnerable device but rather directed at it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send fragmented packets to the vulnerable route processor.
- No authentication is required.

**Affected Products:**
The vulnerability affects Cisco CRS-1 and CRS-3 route processor cards running Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 3.3.0 to 4.2.0. Specifically, these cards are affected:
  - Cisco CRS-1 Distributed Route Processor (CRS-DRP-B)
  - Cisco CRS-1 16-Slot Line-Card Chassis Route Processor (CRS-16-RP)
  - Cisco CRS-1 8-Slot Line-Card Chassis Route Processor (CRS-8-RP)
  - Cisco CRS-1 16-Slot Line Card Chassis Route Processor B (CRS-16-RP-B)
  - Cisco CRS Series 4/8-Slot Line Card Chassis Performance Route Processor (12 GB) (CRS-8-PRP-12G)
  - Cisco CRS Series 4/8-Slot Line Card Chassis Performance Route Processor (6 GB) (CRS-8-PRP-6G)
  - Cisco CRS Series 16-Slot Performance Route Processor (12 GB) (CRS-16-PRP-12G)
  - Cisco CRS Series 16-Slot Performance Route Processor (6 GB) (CRS-16-PRP-6G)

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is tracked by Cisco Bug ID CSCuh30380.
- There are no known workarounds.
- The vulnerability is addressed in the same SMU as Cisco bug ID: CSCtz62593
- The vulnerability was discovered while diagnosing issues encountered in customer networks.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.1 (Base) and 5.9 (Temporal) with a vector of AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C.
