| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software IPv6 Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20130925-ipv6vfr  First Published: 2013 September 25 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCud64812](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud64812)     CVE-2013-5474     CWE-362       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2013-5474     CWE-362       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-ipv6vfr/oval/cisco-sa-20130925-ipv6vfr_397.xml)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the implementation of the virtual fragmentation reassembly (VFR) feature for IP version 6 (IPv6) in Cisco IOS Software could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to hang or reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices running an affected Cisco IOS Software release are vulnerable if the IPv6 VFR feature is enabled.       The **show ipv6 virtual-reassembly | include Interface|drop** privileged EXEC command can be used to determine whether the IPv6 VFR feature has been enabled on a Cisco IOS device. The following is the output from the **show ipv6 virtual-reassembly | include Interface|drop** command executed on a device running Cisco IOS Software that has the IPv6 VFR feature enabled on multiple interfaces:   ```   Router#show ipv6 virtual-reassembly | include Interface|drop%Interface FastEthernet0/0 [in]    IPv6 configured drop fragments: ON%Interface FastEthernet0/1 [in]    IPv6 configured drop fragments: ON%Interface Serial0/0/0 [in]    IPv6 configured drop fragments: ON%Interface Serial0/0/1 [in]    IPv6 configured drop fragments: OFF%Interface FastEthernet0/1 [out]    IPv6 configured drop fragments: OFF%Interface Serial0/1/0 [out]    IPv6 configured drop fragments: ONRouter#   ```   The previous example shows the IPv6 VFR feature enabled both on the ingress direction (displayed as [in] after the interface name) and on the egress direction (displayed as [out] after the interface name).       The IPv6 VFR feature allows the use of a **drop-fragments** option to the **ipv6 virtual-reassembly** command. In this configuration, the IPv6 VFR feature will not perform virtual fragmentation reassembly, but will drop the fragments. Devices using the **drop-fragments** option on every interface configured for IPv6 VFR are not affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability applies only to those devices that are configured for IPv6 VFR for either ingress or egress traffic that have at least one interface with the **drop-fragments** option disabled.      The IPv6 VFR feature is not enabled by default. To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are confirmed not affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco IOS XE SoftwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Fragmentation is a process of breaking down an IP   datagram into smaller packets that are transmitted over different types of   network media. Non-initial fragments of a fragmented IPv6 packet previously passed through other Cisco IOS features without any examination because of the lack   of the Layer 4 (L4) header, which is only available on the initial   fragment. The IPv6 VFR feature   provides the ability to collect the fragments and provide L4 information for other Cisco IOS features.      A vulnerability in the implementation of the virtual fragmentation reassembly (VFR) feature for IP version 6 (IPv6) in Cisco IOS Software could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to hang or reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The   vulnerability is due to a race condition while accessing the reassembly   queue for IPv6 fragments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability   by sending a crafted stream of valid IPv6 fragments. Repeated   exploitation may result in a sustained DoS condition.   Note: both transit traffic and traffic to the device itself can trigger this vulnerability.   This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCud64812](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud64812) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5474  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.
