Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5547:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper processing of malformed EoGRE (Ethernet over Generic Routing Encapsulation) packets within Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed EoGRE packets on a configured interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause an affected device to reload, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send malformed IPv4 or IPv6 EoGRE packets.
- The attack targets devices with EoGRE configured on an interface. It does not involve sending packets to traverse the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker must be able to send malformed EoGRE packets to the affected device where an EoGRE interface is configured.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software.
- EoGRE is not enabled by default.
- The vulnerability is documented under Cisco bug ID [CSCuf08269](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf08269).
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Fixes for this vulnerability are included in Cisco IOS XE Software versions 3.9.2S and later.
