Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5655:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The FTP server within the YingZhi Python Programming Language for iOS application does not properly sanitize user input, specifically related to path traversal sequences like "../".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The FTP server is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks due to insufficient input validation. By using ".." sequences in the requested path, an attacker can navigate outside of the intended FTP root directory.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The FTP server does not enforce proper authentication; any username/password combination grants access. While not directly related to CVE-2013-5655, it is a related security issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can use the path traversal vulnerability to read and potentially write to arbitrary files on the device's storage. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., the /private/etc/passwd file as demonstrated) or allow the attacker to modify system files potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device running the vulnerable application. The FTP server is bound to the device's IP address.
- **FTP Client:** The attacker uses an FTP client to connect to the vulnerable server and sends specially crafted requests that include path traversal sequences (e.g. "../").

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network (or have network access) as the device running the vulnerable application.
- **FTP Client:** The attacker needs an FTP client to initiate the connection.
- **Basic FTP Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of basic FTP commands to navigate directories and request specific files/locations.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided content indicates that the FTP server is enabled by touching the "Computer<->This Machine" option, and it binds to the device's IP address and not localhost.
- The unauthenticated access vulnerability is not included in the CVE scope.
