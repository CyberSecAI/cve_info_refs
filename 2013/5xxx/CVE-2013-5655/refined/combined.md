Use CVE-2013-5654. Support for anonymous upload is, at least, rare in
HTTP servers and this behavior would seem to violate reasonable user
expectations.

If you have any further information about the specific statements in
OSVDB entry 96720, please let us know. For example, have you confirmed
that the default configuration of this HTTP server enables a PHP
interpreter, such that uploads of .php files are especially dangerous?

Use CVE-2013-5655.

> The ftp server doesn't bother authenticating users, any
> username/password combination will allow you in.

We're not immediately assigning a CVE ID for this authentication
behavior because it might be an intentional part of the vendor's
design, and might have been reasonable in the vendor's envisioned
development environment. If there is any documentation suggesting that
this is instead an authentication bypass (e.g., the product allows the
user to configure a username/password combination), the assignment can
of course be reconsidered.

Subject: YingZhi Python Programming Language for iOS ftp .. bug & httpd
 arbitrary upload

Hi,

I'd like to request a CVE for these vulnerabilities I disclosed back on Sept 27 2012.

YingZhi Python Programming Language for iOS

Vendor:﻿ XiaoWen Huang, YingZhi Python for iOS.

Ver 1.9.

OSVDB IDs: 96719 & 96720

Product Websites
<http://sosilen.blog.163.com>
<http://www.iphoneappstorm.com/iphone-apps/utilities/com.yingzhi.python/yingzhipython.php?id=493505744> YingZhi

Description:
Python Interpreter is a native python development application for the iPad/iPhone. It is available for iOS 4 and above.

The product is packaged with its own httpd and ftpd servers. Enabling the local daemons for development by Touching Computer<->This Machine starts up an httpd server and ftpd server, both daemons are bound to device IP not localhost.
Vulnerabilities:

httpd server allows upload of arbitrary files to root WWW directory.

Browsing to http://<target_ip>:8080/ presents an index page in which anyone can upload files to the web servers root
directory.

ftp server vulnerable to ../ bug

The ftp server doesn't sanitize user input and allows remote users to read and possibly write to the devices storage.

ftp://192.168.0.24:10000/../../../../../../../private/etc/passwd

The ftp server doesn't bother authenticating users, any username/password combination will allow you in.
