Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the App-ID cache function of Palo Alto Networks' PAN-OS. Specifically, the firewall's App-ID cache could be "poisoned" by a series of specially crafted network requests. This "poisoning" would lead to the firewall incorrectly identifying traffic, potentially allowing blocked applications to bypass security policies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **App-ID Cache Pollution:** The core vulnerability lies in the susceptibility of the App-ID cache to manipulation through crafted network traffic. This allows for bypassing security policies that rely on accurate application identification.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The system did not properly validate the incoming network requests before caching, thus allowing for malicious "poisoning" to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassing Security Policies:**  A successful attack would allow a user to bypass security policies designed to block specific applications. This could allow unauthorized access to services, exfiltration of data, and other malicious activities.
- **Temporary Access:** The bypass is not permanent, it only lasts until the cache is cleared or refreshed, but this temporary access can be exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attacks:** The attack occurs over the network by sending crafted requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledgeable User:** The attacker needs to be a knowledgeable user with an understanding of how the App-ID cache works.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send network requests that can reach the targeted Palo Alto Networks firewall.

**Additional Details:**

- The blog post clarifies that this specific variant of App-ID cache pollution used different applications (Facebook and SIP) and conditions than a previously known technique (using HTTP and SMTP).
- Palo Alto Networks acknowledged that the vulnerability existed for a while, and it was publicly disclosed in a YouTube video by Check Point, who is a competitor.
- Palo Alto Networks recommends using "application-default" or specific ports in the service field of security policies as a mitigation strategy, along with the software updates, to minimize the chances of such evasions.
- The vendor assigned a low severity score to the vulnerability.
- The vendor indicates that the vulnerability is a result of not following responsible disclosure processes by Check Point.
