Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The default markup formatter in Jenkins CI v1.523 allows offsite-bound forms, enabling injection of malicious HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary HTML code into a user's profile description field.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied HTML input, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Lack of form action restriction**: The application's default policy allows form actions to point to offsite URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Persistent Phishing:** An attacker can inject a fake login form that redirects credentials to an external site, effectively performing phishing attacks on users visiting the profile of the malicious user.
- **Persistent External Redirects:** Attackers can inject HTML that redirects users to arbitrary external websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely by a malicious user.
- **User Input:** The attacker injects malicious HTML code into the 'Description' field within the user configuration section of Jenkins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege User Account:** The attacker needs a low privilege user account within the Jenkins CI application to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Access to User Configuration:** The attacker needs access to the user configuration section to modify the user description field.
