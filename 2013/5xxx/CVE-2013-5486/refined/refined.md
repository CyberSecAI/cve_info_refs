Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `processImageSave.jsp` file of the Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM). This flaw allows for arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient input validation and a directory traversal vulnerability. The vulnerability is further exacerbated by a null byte injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The `processImageSave.jsp` file does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to manipulate file paths and access directories outside of the intended scope.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The application fails to handle null bytes correctly. Attackers can inject a null byte (`%00`) into the file path, which truncates the path and allows them to place files in unintended locations.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is insufficient input validation on the `chartid` parameter, allowing for arbitrary file paths to be passed to the function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can upload arbitrary files to the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious WAR (Web Application Archive) file to the auto-deploy directory of the JBoss application server, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the underlying operating system. The code executes with the privileges of the system user under which the Cisco Prime DCNM runs (system user on Windows or root user on Linux).
*   **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to `processImageSave.jsp` with malicious file paths in the `chartid` parameter, a `savefile` parameter set to `true`, and the base64 encoded content of the malicious file in the `data` parameter.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The attacker uses `..` sequences in the `chartid` parameter to navigate the file system.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The attacker injects a null byte (`%00`) into the file path to truncate it, allowing the attacker to save files in locations they would not normally have write access to, specifically the JBoss auto deploy folder for achieving code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable Cisco Prime DCNM instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URI to the `processImageSave.jsp` file and how to craft the exploit request.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Cisco Prime DCNM prior to 6.2(1).
*   The vulnerability was reported by Andrea Micalizzi aka rgod working with HP's Zero Day Initiative.
*   A Metasploit module (EDB-ID: 30008) is available for exploiting this vulnerability, which was tested on Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager 6.1(2) on Windows 2008 R2 (64 bits).
*   The exploit takes advantage of the JBoss autodeploy feature to achieve remote code execution by uploading and deploying a malicious war file.
