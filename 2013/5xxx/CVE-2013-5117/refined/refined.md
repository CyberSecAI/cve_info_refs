Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `dnnarticlerss.aspx` page of the DNNArticle module, leading to SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`categoryid` parameter) before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **High Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This can lead to:
    *   Data breach/disclosure of sensitive information.
    *   Data manipulation/modification.
    *   Potential full compromise of the application and the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker manipulates the `categoryid` parameter in a GET request to the vulnerable `dnnarticlerss.aspx` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The attacker does not need any interaction from the victim user to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `categoryid` in the URL path `/desktopmodules/dnnarticle/dnnarticlerss.aspx`.
*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) URL is:
    `http://server/desktopmodules/dnnarticle/dnnarticlerss.aspx?moduleid=0&categoryid=1+or+1=@@version`
    This payload demonstrates a successful SQL injection, where `1+or+1=@@version` is injected to retrieve database version information.

**Affected Versions:**

*   DNNArticle 10.0 and earlier versions are affected.

**Vendor Information and Solution:**
* Vendor website: `http://www.zldnn.com/` and `http://www.dnnarticle.com/`
* Vendor Advisory:  `http://www.zldnn.com/Support/tabid/643/ctl/RecordList/mid/1691/ItemID/2979/Default.aspx`
