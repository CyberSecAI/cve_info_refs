Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5413:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator and IBM Sterling File Gateway applications do not invalidate session identifiers upon user logout.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session management flaw: Failure to invalidate session identifiers after logout.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking/impersonation: An attacker could potentially use the uninvalidated session identifiers to impersonate the logged-out user and perform actions on their behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: This vulnerability can be exploited by someone with access to the session identifier of a logged-out user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid session identifier of a user who has logged out of the application. The content doesn't specify how they would obtain the session identifier, however, the low CVSS score (1.9) seems to indicate that the attack vector is local and is not exploitable over the network.
