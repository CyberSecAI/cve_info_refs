  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The GetElementIC typed array stub in the JavaScript engine could be generated without properly respecting the monitoredResult() status, leading to type confusion and potentially exploitable undefined behavior.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
       "Improper handling of monitored results during JavaScript compilation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially cause undefined behavior, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution or other security breaches.",
    "attack_vectors": "By exploiting a specially crafted web page or JavaScript code.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious web page containing JavaScript designed to trigger the vulnerability.",
     "details": "The vulnerability lies in the way GetElementIC typed array stubs were generated in the JavaScript engine. These stubs, responsible for optimizing array access, could incorrectly cache type information when the access was out of bounds. Specifically, the stubs failed to properly use the monitoredResult() status, which tracks if an operation's result is being observed for potential changes. If an access initially returned 'undefined' (out of bounds), the stub could assume this would always be the case, even when a valid, in-bounds access occurred later. This resulted in the stub using the 'undefined' type when it should have been using the correct type, leading to type confusion and potential exploitation. The vulnerability was present because the stubs were not checking an 'out of bounds' flag and therefore weren't monitoring the success type correctly at stub generation time."
