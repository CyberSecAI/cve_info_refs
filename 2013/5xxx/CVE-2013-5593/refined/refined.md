Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2013-5593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject arbitrary HTML content within `<select>` elements. When a page containing such manipulated `<select>` elements is navigated away from while the dropdown menu is active, the HTML content can render outside the intended boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Spoofing:** The injected HTML can be used to overlay and visually spoof the address bar, SSL indicators, and other browser UI elements.
*   **Clickjacking:** The overlaid content can be used to trick users into clicking on unintended elements, potentially leading to actions the user did not intend to take, such as granting geolocation permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** Attackers can make it appear as though the user is on a trusted site, when they are actually on a malicious one.
*   **Clickjacking Attacks:** Users can be tricked into inadvertently granting permissions or performing other actions by clicking on the spoofed content which overlays the browser's UI.
*   **Other Spoofing Attacks:** The arbitrary placement of HTML elements can be used to mislead the user in various other ways, depending on the specific content that is injected and overlaid.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can host specially crafted web pages containing the malicious `<select>` elements.
*   **Email (Potentially):** While scripting is often disabled in email clients, rendering the vulnerability less effective there, the description notes a potential risk in browser-like contexts within email clients such as Thunderbird and SeaMonkey.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create a web page with crafted HTML or be able to inject malicious HTML into an email.
*   The attacker needs to entice a user to navigate to the malicious page or open an email containing malicious HTML.
*   The vulnerability exploits the way `<select>` dropdown menus are rendered when navigating away from a page, so no special position is required other than the user having an active dropdown menu element while navigation occurs.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was classified as "sec-moderate" due to the nature of it being a visual spoof, rather than actually manipulating the location bar content.
* A patch was created to ensure that dropdown menus cannot overlap the URL bar by always opening menus below the element in cases where the available space would cause the menu to overlap.
* While the double click trick is mentioned, this was noted as only working on Windows. The fix was applied to prevent the overlap regardless of the double click behavior.
* The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 25, Firefox ESR 24.1, SeaMonkey 2.22, and Thunderbird 24.1.
