Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-5641 CVE-2013-5642

Colin Cuthbertson and Walter Doekes discovered two vulnerabilities in
the SIP processing code of Asterisk - an open source PBX and telephony
toolkit -, which could result in denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze11.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.13.1~dfsg-3+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# AST-2013-004: Remote Crash From Late Arriving SIP ACK With SDP

*From*: "Asterisk Security Team" <security () asterisk org>

*Date*: Tue, 27 Aug 2013 19:26:07 -0500

```
               Asterisk Project Security Advisory - AST-2013-004

          Product         Asterisk
          Summary         Remote Crash From Late Arriving SIP ACK With SDP
     Nature of Advisory   Remote Crash
       Susceptibility     Remote Unauthenticated Sessions
          Severity        Major
       Exploits Known     None
        Reported On       February 11, 2013
        Reported By       Colin Cuthbertson
         Posted On        August 27, 2013
      Last Updated On     August 27, 2013
      Advisory Contact    Joshua Colp <jcolp AT digium DOT com>
          CVE Name        Pending

    Description  A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the
                 SIP channel driver if an ACK with SDP is received after the
                 channel has been terminated. The handling code incorrectly
                 assumes that the channel will always be present.

    Resolution  A check has now been added which only parses SDP and applies
                it if an Asterisk channel is present.

                Note that Walter Doekes, OSSO B.V., is responsible for
                diagnosing and providing the fix for this issue.

| Description: | Asterisk is frequently segfaulting (several times per week) in \_\_ast\_queue\_frame at at channel.c:1450.   This is a fairly busy call routing server with up to 120 calls at peak times. Calls come in on a SIP channel and are routed straight back out on another SIP channel. directmedia=yes.   There are about eleven lines of dialplan for each call:  {noformat}  Set("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "TAG=xxxxx")  NoOp("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "Call from x to y")  Gosub("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "sub-set-group,s,1(xxxxx)  Set("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "GROUP()=xxxxx")  NoOp("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "xxxxx: Call 27")  Return("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "")  Set("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "CDR(accountcode)=xxxx")  Gosub("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "sub-set-cli,xxx,1")  Set("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "CALLERID(num)=nnnnnnnnnnnn")  Return("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "")  Dial("SIP/xxxx-0000044c", "SIP/trunk/yyyy,300,C")  {noformat}   The problem does not appear to be load related. The segfault has happened with only 26 calls in progress.   The segfault has also happened after only 30 minutes of uptime and then not again for a few days.   We have seen the problem on three different VM's.   I have a feeling that the problem is only happening with calls from one source SIP trunk but I have been unable to prove this.   {noformat}  Program terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault.  #0  0x000000000046a961 in \_\_ast\_queue\_frame (chan=0x0, fin=0x41d72f60, head=0, after=0x0) at channel.c:1450  1450            cur = AST\_LIST\_LAST(&chan->readq);  {noformat}   I have attached a backtrace. Please let me know if any further information is required. | | |
| Comments: | By: Matt Jordan (mjordan) 2013-02-11 10:32:31.087-0600For some reason, there isn't a channel in place when Asterisk handles this particular ACK.   Can you provide a DEBUG log, as well as a pcap showing the message traffic leading up to the crash? There may be a deeper issue here where the channel that is having direct media negotiated on it is getting disposed of improperly.   ---   By: Joshua C. Colp (jcolp) 2013-02-18 06:31:49.132-0600ASTERISK-21112 is an internal Digium task, any updates will be posted here.  ---   By: Colin Cuthbertson (colin\_c) 2013-05-31 11:01:23.445-0500Has there been any progress made on this issue or ASTERISK-21112 ?   Our customer is still experiencing the segfaults. If you need any further debug information from me, please let me know.  ---   By: Matt Jordan (mjordan) 2013-06-06 09:14:31.275-0500Your issue is in queue, please be patient, and we will get to it as time permits and developer resources become available.   ---   By: Elwin Formsma (formsmae) 2013-06-21 04:24:42.198-0500We are experiencing this problem as well. Any sight on when you will look at this?  ---   By: Michael (talkttcom) 2013-07-30 13:19:24.538-0500This problem happens 3-4 times a day.

Thanks.  ---   By: Walter Doekes (wdoekes) 2013-08-19 04:50:03.526-0500Is that ACK (from readbuf in {{backtrace\_20130212.txt}}) supposed to be in the pcap ({{pcap\_20130212.pcap}}), because I don't see it.   You might set directmedia to no, to avoid the issue.  ---   By: Walter Doekes (wdoekes) 2013-08-20 06:31:23.643-0500{noformat}  $ sudo asterisk -V  Asterisk SVN-branch-1.8-r396745   $ cat /etc/asterisk/sip.conf  [general]  allowguest=yes   $ cat /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf  [default]  exten => answer,1,Answer()  same => n,Hangup()   $ sudo gdb asterisk  (gdb) run -c   $ sipp -m 1 -sf issueA21064\_late\_ack\_of\_death.xml 127.0.0.1 -key tel answer   # OBSERVE: you may need to tweak the pause in the sipp scenario a bit  # In my case 510ms was 100% reliable.
