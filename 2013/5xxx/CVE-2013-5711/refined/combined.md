### [Don’t Bother Buying the Premium](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/dont-bother-buying-the-premium/)

I have been struggling to get support for this plugin (after paying for premium) for 7 months now. Though my license is valid until next year, I get a message that my access has been revoked, which has happened, been fixed and keeps happening again, so the developer tells me that I need to manually download the plugins from his site. The site confirms my payment and that I should have ‘support’ until next year, but when I go to manually download the plugin to install I get a “your license has been revoked” message. He blames my hosting provider for this?!? but it is happening on HIS website. Horrible, horrible experience. Now we have to move our clients to a different system, outside of wordpress. Don’t bother installing the free version – you’ll realize the limitations very quickly and the pay-to-play version is just a scam. There is no support, only blaming. He told me to tell my hosting provider to “open all ports” to fix the license that is revoked on his own site – what a joke!

Creating a plugin and supplying it as a free tool is kind of developers. By creating a free bare-bones plugin, the hope is that users will upgrade to the paid extensions, which is fine.
My problem is that there is NO support for issues about the plugin. If you look in the support forums, you’ll see that sometimes it take more than 3 months for a question to be answered. THREE MONTHS!!!
This plugin has potential, but it’s not the only game in town, so to speak. It seems that I’ll now be looking for another plugin where the developers VALUE their customer base.

There are way to many things that can get messed up in this. A user should be able to login and say YES I love it or no I hate it. Then the designer can fix whatever is needed. When I started to use this it would try to create a post but the post would not show up so the link was dead. If I created the post manual – it would work. Even then its just not easy to use. Its like it is pasted together and uses native aspects of wordpress. I would gladly pay for this if it was less clunky and much more easy for a designer of mine to use. It is a good idea but for the price I gave it 2 stars because it should be much better.

### [Fantastic plugin & Extensions](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fantastic-plugin-extensions/)

February 3, 2017

I downloaded the free version and this is a pretty robust plugin. I was happy enough with it to upgrade to purchasing some premium extensions. The support is top notch. Highly recommend.
