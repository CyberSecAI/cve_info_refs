  "CVE-2013-5375": {
    "description": "CVE-2013-5375 allows code running under a security manager to access restricted classes. This vulnerability could occur when untrusted code is executed under a security manager, or when the IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition has been associated with a web browser for running applets and Web Start applications.",
    "root_cause": "An unspecified vulnerability in the XML component of IBM JDK allows code running under a security manager to access restricted classes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
       "XML external entity processing vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Code running under a security manager can access restricted classes.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Execution of untrusted code under a security manager.",
      "Java applets or Web Start applications running in a web browser associated with the vulnerable IBM Java SDK/JRE."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute untrusted code or to have code run as a Java applet/webstart application in an environment with the vulnerable IBM Java SDK/JRE.",
    "affected_products": [
      "IBM SDK, Java 2 Technology Edition, Version 5.0 Service Refresh 16 Fix pack 3 and earlier",
      "IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 6 Service Refresh 14 and earlier",
      "IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 6.0.1 Service Refresh 6 and earlier",
      "IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 7 Service Refresh 5 and earlier",
       "IBM WebSphere Real Time Version 3 Service Refresh 5 and earlier",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary with java-1.5.0-ibm, java-1.6.0-ibm and java-1.7.0-ibm",
      "Red Hat Satellite 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is related to the XML component of the Java SDK. It allows for a sandbox bypass, enabling code to potentially access restricted classes. Red Hat also identifies the vulnerability as an 'unspecified sandbox bypass' in the XML component. A similar description is provided in the IBM WebSphere Real Time bulletin, where it is noted that this vulnerability allows code running under a security manager to access restricted classes.",
