Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5605:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   The provided text mentions CVE-2013-5605 explicitly, along with details that match the official description (a flaw in how NSS handled handshake packets). Therefore, this content is related to the CVE.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from `Null_Cipher()` not respecting `maxOutputLen`. When processing handshake packets, the function would copy an attacker-controlled amount of bytes without verifying that the amount of input bytes is less than or equal to the maximum allowed output length.
   - The `ssl3_HandleRecord` function has record size checks but these are only applied if the TLS flag is true. This allows for bypassing the size check.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

   - **Buffer Overflow:** The primary issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the `Null_Cipher` function of NSS.
   - **Missing Input Validation:**  The `Null_Cipher` function lacks validation, allowing `inputLen` to be greater than `maxOutputLen` in the `PORT_Memcpy` function, leading to memory corruption and overwrite. 
   - **Improper Access Control:**  The `ssl3_HandleRecord` function has record size checks but these are only applied if the TLS flag is true, allowing for bypassing the size check in `ssl3_GatherData` and potentially other parts of the code.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the TLS/SSL client using NSS to crash, leading to denial of service.
   - **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application because of the memory corruption.
   - **Memory Corruption**: The overflow is directly caused by `PORT_memcpy` which would write over a buffer.

**5. Attack vectors:**

   - **Network:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability through network traffic
   - **Malformed SSL/TLS Handshake Packets:** The attack vector specifically involves sending specially crafted or malformed SSL/TLS handshake packets.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

   - **Remote access:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to a vulnerable NSS application.
   - **Crafting Malformed Packets:** The attacker needs to craft malformed SSL records with an `inputLen` greater than `maxOutputLen` to trigger the overflow.

**Additional Details from the content (beyond official CVE description):**

  - The issue was discovered during fuzzing of NSS by a Google developer.
  - The vulnerability is present in both NSS 3.15.3 and 3.14.5.
   - The fix involves adding a check in `Null_Cipher()` function to compare input length with maximum output length and error out.
  -  The check is not placed in `ssl3_HandleRecord` but in `Null_Cipher()` because it would match the API contract of the other ciphers.
  - The record length check in `ssl3_HandleRecord` only applies if 'isTLS' is true, potentially allowing exploitation if non-TLS protocol version was in use.
  - The vulnerable record size must be 18434 to bypass other record size checks.
  - The vulnerability is present in other Mozilla products such as Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey, and other products using the NSS library.
  - The fix has been backported to older versions of the products affected.
  - Red Hat assigned a "Important" rating to the flaw.
  - The vulnerability was also present in NSPR (Netscape Portable Runtime)
