Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-5447:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the IBM Forms Viewer due to a dangerous usage of `strcpy`-like function. This occurs when parsing malformed XFDL files, specifically within the 'fontname' tag when it contains a long value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow.
- Improper handling of input data (specifically the 'fontname' tag within XFDL files) during parsing.
- Usage of unsafe string copy operations (`strcpy`-like functions) which do not perform bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system under the context of the user running the vulnerable application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via a malformed XFDL file.
- User interaction is required: A user must open a malicious XFDL file or visit a webpage with embedded malicious content which leverages the IBM Forms Viewer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious XFDL file with a long fontname value that causes a buffer overflow when parsed by the IBM Forms Viewer.
- Ability to deliver the malicious XFDL file to a victim. This could be done via email, a malicious website, or other means.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the `fontname` tag within an XFDL document.
- The exploit has been tested successfully on IBM Forms Viewer 4.0 on Windows XP SP3 and Windows 7 SP1.
- The Metasploit module provides a proof of concept exploit for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM on 2013-09-27 and a coordinated public release of the advisory was done on 2013-12-15.
- IBM has released an update to address this vulnerability.
