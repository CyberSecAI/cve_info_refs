- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handling objects in memory, leading to an integer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow in the Win32k.sys driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service, causing the target system to stop responding.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to run a specially crafted application locally or convince a logged on user to run it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the system or must convince a logged on user to run a specially crafted application.
