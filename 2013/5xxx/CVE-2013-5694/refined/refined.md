Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-5694

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the "acknowledge" function of Opsview.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `service_selection` parameter within the acknowledge function, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code.  Since it is "blind," the attacker cannot directly see the output, but can infer results based on response times or other indirect indicators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Database Dump:** An attacker can potentially dump the database content.
* **User Creation:**  The attacker may be able to create new administrative user accounts.
* **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/status/service/acknowledge` endpoint.
* **`service_selection` Parameter:** The SQL injection is injected into the `service_selection` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable Opsview instance.
* **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter**: Attacker needs to know that the `service_selection` parameter is vulnerable.
* **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques, particularly for blind SQL injection.

**Additional Information:**

* **Affected Versions:** Opsview versions prior to 4.4.1 are vulnerable.
* **Vendor Contacted:** The vendor was contacted on 2013-09-04, and a fix was released with Opsview 4.4.1.
* **Exploit Example:** The provided content includes a sample HTTP POST request demonstrating the attack vector.
* **Remediation:** The vendor released a patch in version 4.4.1 to address this issue.
