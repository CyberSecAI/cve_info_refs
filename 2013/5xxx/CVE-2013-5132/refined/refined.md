- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed in the parsing of small frames with incorrect lengths.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation. Specifically, the AirPort Base Station firmware did not properly validate the size of small frames during parsing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An associated client may be able to cause an unexpected base station system termination (Denial of Service).
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted small frames with incorrect lengths to the AirPort Base Station.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an associated client on the same network as the vulnerable AirPort Base Station.
