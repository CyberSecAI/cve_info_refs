Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper output escaping of the `deliv_id` parameter within the payment templates of EC-CUBE. Specifically, the value of  `$arrForm[$key].value` was being directly inserted into the HTML without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious code into the `deliv_id` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser when they view the payment page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser. This could lead to:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Defacing the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker crafts a malicious `deliv_id` parameter containing JavaScript code.
- This malicious parameter is submitted to the application and stored or passed to the vulnerable templates
- When the payment page is rendered, the unsanitized `deliv_id` parameter is output in the HTML, and the browser executes the embedded JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious value into the `deliv_id` parameter. This could be through:
  - Manipulating URL parameters in a GET request
  - Submitting a modified POST request
  - Potentially through other vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to control the value of `deliv_id`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves HTML-encoding the value of `$arrForm[$key].value` using the Smarty template engine's `|h` modifier before it is inserted into the HTML. This prevents the browser from interpreting the value as JavaScript code.
- The vulnerable files are:
    - `/data/Smarty/templates/default/shopping/payment.tpl`
    - `/data/Smarty/templates/mobile/shopping/payment.tpl`
    - `/data/Smarty/templates/sphone/shopping/payment.tpl`
- The vulnerability affects versions of EC-CUBE from 2.11.0 to 2.13.0.
