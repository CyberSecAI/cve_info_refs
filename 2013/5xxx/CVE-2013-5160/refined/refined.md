- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A NULL dereference in the lock screen occurs when the emergency call button is repeatedly tapped, causing it to restart.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: NULL dereference vulnerability in the lock screen, improper state handling in the call dialer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: While the lock screen is restarting, the call dialer assumes the device is unlocked and allows dialing non-emergency numbers, bypassing the passcode lock.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the device. The attacker needs to repeatedly tap the emergency call button.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires physical access to the device to exploit this vulnerability.
