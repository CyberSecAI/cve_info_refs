## iOS 7.0.2

* **Passcode Lock**

  Available for: iPhone 4 and later

  Impact: A person with physical access to the device may be able to make calls to any number

  Description: A NULL dereference existed in the lock screen which would cause it to restart if the emergency call button was tapped repeatedly. While the lock screen was restarting, the call dialer could not get the lock screen state and assumed the device was unlocked, and so allowed non-emergency numbers to be dialed. This issue was addressed by avoiding the NULL dereference.

* **Passcode Lock**

  Available for: iPhone 4 and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: A person with physical access to the device may be able to see recently used apps, see, edit, and share photos

  Description: The list of apps you opened could be accessed during some transitions while the device was locked, and the Camera app could be opened while the device was locked.
