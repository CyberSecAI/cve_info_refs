### Summary of CVE-2013-5618

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** A use-after-free error occurs in the table editing user interface during garbage collection. This happens when an anonymous node is released in `nsNodeUtils::LastRelease` during table editing.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Use-after-free: The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact:**
*   **Critical:** This can lead to an exploitable crash, which might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application (Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey).
*   Denial of Service: The use-after-free can also lead to a denial of service through application crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Web pages with malicious content: An attacker can craft a malicious web page that, when opened by a user, triggers the vulnerability through table editing user interface and garbage collection.
*   Specially crafted messages: In the context of Thunderbird, this could potentially be exploited through a specially crafted email message, with scripting enabled.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
*   Ability to create a malicious web page or email that can trigger specific table editing actions in the editor and force a garbage collection cycle at the right time.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
*  If email is the attack vector, scripting has to be enabled for Thunderbird.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered using the Address Sanitizer (ASAN) tool during fuzzing, which indicates the use of a technique to find memory corruption bugs automatically.
*   The vulnerability is present in multiple Mozilla products including Firefox, Thunderbird and Seamonkey.
*   The fix involved changes to handle mParent pointers correctly.

**Affected Products**

*   Firefox
*   Firefox ESR
*   SeaMonkey
*   Thunderbird

**Fix versions**

*   Firefox 26
*   Firefox ESR 24.2
