Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of an **XML External Entity (XXE) injection** vulnerability and a **SQL injection** vulnerability within Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager (SEPM).
*   The XXE vulnerability exists because the SEPM's `ConsoleServlet` uses a custom `MultipartParser` to handle multipart HTTP requests. When a body with a `Content-Type` of `text/xml` is encountered, the Java `DocumentBuilder` class is used to parse the XML. The application does not disable DTD processing, making it vulnerable to XXE injection.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability resides within the `ConfigServerHandler`, specifically in the `updateReportingVersion` function. This handler is intended to only receive requests from localhost, and input is not validated when constructing the SQL query. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands through the "Parameter" URL parameter with the "action" parameter set to "test_av".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The application's failure to disable DTD processing during XML parsing allows external entities to be included, leading to potential information disclosure or SSRF attacks.
*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input validation in the `updateReportingVersion` function allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The use of an embedded SQL Anywhere database with `xp_cmdshell` enabled further increases the severity, as it allows for OS command execution via SQL injection.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `ConfigServerHandler` does not properly sanitize input, leading to the SQL injection.
*   **Trusting Localhost:** The assumption that the `ConfigServerHandler` would only receive requests from localhost was incorrect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** By combining XXE to trigger the SQL injection, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the SEPM server with SYSTEM privileges. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** By exploiting the SQL injection, attackers may be able to access or manipulate sensitive database information.
*   **SSRF:** The XXE vulnerability, although described as blind, can be used to perform SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), potentially accessing internal network resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends a crafted multipart HTTP POST request containing malicious XML to the `/servlet/ConsoleServlet` endpoint.
*   **Chained Exploitation:** The attacker leverages the XXE vulnerability to initiate a request to the vulnerable SQL injection endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the SEPM server, usually on port 9090.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable servlet and parameter names in the SEPM application.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious multipart HTTP POST request with the correct structure to trigger the XXE and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Symantec Endpoint Protection Manager versions 11.0, 12.0, and 12.1.
*   The embedded SQL Anywhere database (used in default SEPM setups) makes the exploit more reliable due to the presence of the `xp_cmdshell` stored procedure.
*   The exploit uses a crafted XML document with a DTD that includes an external entity referencing the vulnerable SQL injection endpoint. This triggers a SQL injection that executes OS commands through `xp_cmdshell`.

In summary, this is a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker to achieve remote command execution by exploiting an XXE vulnerability to trigger a SQL injection, ultimately leading to full system compromise.
