Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities addressed by the ArcGIS 10.2 for Server Security Patch (September 2013), which is associated with CVE-2013-5221:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed:**

1.  **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    *   **Root Cause:** Vulnerability in the Mobile Content Directory.
    *   **Weakness:**  Persistent XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploited through the Mobile Content Directory, requires administrative access.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires administrative privileges to exploit.

2.  **Unrestricted File Upload**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper file type validation when uploading files.
    *   **Weakness:**  Allows authenticated administrators to upload any type of file, including potentially unsafe files.
    *  **Impact:** Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., scripts, executables) that could compromise the server or other users.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading files via the application's upload functionality, requires administrative access.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires administrative privileges and authentication.

3.  **SQL Injection**
    *   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user input in map and feature services when querying relational databases.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows unauthorized modification of data in the underlying database (SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, or Informix).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerable map and feature services when querying the database.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the attacker to craft specific SQL injection queries.

4.  **Token Acquisition Through HTTP GET**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Tokens could be acquired through HTTP GET requests, exposing credentials in the request URL.
    *   **Weakness:** Exposure of credentials via URL in plain text format
    *   **Impact:** Credentials stored in browser history or in network components could be compromised.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Monitoring the network and browser history.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Can be easily done by an attacker with network access.

**Additional Information:**

*   The patch also addresses other non-security related issues, including NIM094481 and NIM097252 related to query operations and extent retrieval.
*   The patch provides a new security option to disable token acquisition through HTTP GET requests, enforcing HTTP POST.

**Summary:**

The patch addresses multiple critical security vulnerabilities including XSS, unrestricted file upload, and SQL injection. It also addresses a vulnerability related to how tokens are acquired, potentially exposing credentials. This patch aims to enhance the overall security of ArcGIS 10.2 for Server by preventing unauthorized access, data modification, and credential exposure.
