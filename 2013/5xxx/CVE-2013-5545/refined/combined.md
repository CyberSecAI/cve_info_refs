The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

Affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software for 1000 Series ASR will vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the Software Versions and Fixes section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.   Vulnerable ProductsFor specific version information, refer to the Software Versions and Fixes section of this advisory.      **Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload when processing malformed ICMP error packets that belong to a TCP or UDP connection that is inspected by a Zone-Based Firewall (ZBFW). The ZBFW is not enabled by default.      To verify if a ZBFW is configured on a device, use the **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **Match: protocol tcp** or **Match:** **protocol udp** and **Inspect** under the configured zone pair class map in the output of **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair** indicates that the ZBFW inspection for TCP or UDP protocols is configured.      The following output is for **show policy-map type inspect zone-pair** on Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured as a ZBFW: ```   Router#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair   Zone-pair: clients-servers   Service-policy inspect : clients-servers-policy    Class-map: L4-inspect-class (match-any)        Match: protocol tcp      Match: protocol udp      Match: protocol icmp      Inspect            ``` **Note:** Cisco IOS devices configured with a ZBFW are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.      **Cisco IOS XE Software PPTP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT) and PPTP application layer gateway (ALG) inspection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of PPTP packets to traverse a device that is configured for NAT.      Cisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if NAT and PPTP ALG are enabled on an affected device; these services are not enabled by default.      PPTP ALG is enabled on a device when NAT is enabled.       To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **ip nat inside** or **ip nat outside** commands must be present in different interfaces and at least one **ip nat** global configuration command must be present in the configuration.       The **show running-config | include ip nat** command can be used to determine whether NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:    ```   asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat ip nat inside ip nat outside ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1    ```  If the output is empty, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on a given device is not vulnerable. If the output returned is not empty, PPTP ALG services may be explicitly disabled in the NAT configuration. To determine whether PPTP ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration, use the **show run | include ip nat** privileged EXEC command. The presence of **no ip nat service pptp** in the output of **show run | include ip nat** indicates that PPTP ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration.      The following is the output of **show run | include ip nat** in Cisco IOS XE Software that has the PPTP ALG disabled under NAT configuration:    ```         asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat       ip nat inside       ip nat outside       ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1       no ip nat service pptp    ```         **Note:** A configuration command to disable PPTP ALG in the NAT configuration is available in Cisco IOS XE Software versions 3.9 and above. On Cisco IOS XE Software versions prior to 3.9, there is no capability to disable PPTP ALG in the NAT configuration.      Cisco IOS devices configured for PPTP ALG inspection are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.            **Cisco IOS XE Software TCP Segment Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability**   Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing segmented TCP packets that undergo Network Address Translation (NAT). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending TCP packets that are large after the segment reassembly is complete when these packets traverse a device that is configured for NAT.      TCP reassembly is enabled when NAT is enabled.      To determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **ip nat inside** or **ip nat outside** commands must be present in different interfaces and at least one **ip nat** global configuration command must be present in the configuration.       The **show running-config | include ip nat** command can be used to determine whether NAT is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:    ```   asr1004#show running-config | include ip nat ip nat inside ip nat outside ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1    ```  Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers with embedded services processor 100 (ASR1000-ESP100) and Cisco ASR1002-X Series Routers are affected by this vulnerability.      To determine whether a Cisco ASR 1000 device has ASR1000-ESP100 installed or is a Cisco ASR1002-X Series Router, administrators can issue the **show inventory** command. The following is the output of the **show inventory** in Cisco IOS XE Software running on a Cisco ASR 1006 Router with ASR1000-ESP100:  ```      asr1006#show inventory    NAME: "Chassis", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1006 Chassis"   PID: ASR1006             NAME: "module F1", DESCR: "Cisco ASR1000 Embedded Services Processor, 10 0Gbps"   PID: ASR1000-ESP10 0          ```    **Note:** Cisco IOS devices configured for NAT are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.         **Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed EoGRE Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability** Cisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing malformed IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) Ethernet over Generic Routing Encapsulation (EoGRE) packets on an interface configured with EoGRE.    EoGRE is not enabled by default.  To determine whether EoGRE has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the **tunnel mode ethernet gre ipv4** or ****tunnel mode ethernet gre ipv6**** commands must be present on a tunnel interface configuration and at least one IP address must be configured on that interface.      The **show running-config | include Tunnel|(tunnel mode|ip address .)**  command can be used to determine whether EoGRE is present in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:  ```   asr1004#show running-config | include Tunnel|(tunnel mode|ip address .) interface Tunnel0 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0    tunnel mode ethernet gre ipv4      ```    **Note:** Cisco IOS devices configured for EoGRE are not affected by this vulnerability. Only Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers running affected versions of Cisco IOS XE Software are affected by this vulnerability.   Determine the Running Software VersionThe Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS XE releases correspond to the Cisco IOS Software releases. For example, Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.2S is the software release for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS Release 15.2(2)S2.   For more information about mappings between the Cisco IOS XE releases and their associated Cisco IOS releases, see the following:   <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html>   To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software is running on a device, administrators can issue the **show version** command. The following example shows Cisco IOS XE Software that is running IOS XE Software version 3.6.2S, which maps to Cisco IOS Software version 15.2(2)S2:    ```   asr1004#show version Cisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(2)S2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2012 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Tue 07-Aug-12 13:40 by mcpre      ```    **Note:** A Cisco IOS XE Software image consists of seven individual modules, also referred to as subpackages. The packages are designed to use the In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) capability of Cisco IOS XE Software. Customers can choose to upgrade only those packages that need to be upgraded. For more information about the Cisco IOS XE Software packaging, see the following:   http://www.cisco.com/en/US/partner/prod/collateral/routers/ps9343/product\_bulletin\_c25-448387.html      If the packages are upgraded individually, the output of the **show version** command may vary.      Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe products running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS-XR Software are not affected by any of these vulnerabilities.      With the exception of Cisco IOS XE Software for 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, no other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The following section provides additional information about each vulnerability.      **Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**   A vulnerability in the Zone-Based Firewall (ZBFW) TCP or UDP inspection feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed ICMP error packets traversing a vulnerable device that belong to a TCP or UDP connection that is inspected by a ZBFW. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of malformed ICMP error packets that belong to an inspected TCP or UDP session. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtt26470](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtt26470) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5543.         **Cisco IOS XE Software PPTP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability**   A vulnerability in the PPTP ALG feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of PPTP packets that are being inspected as part of the NAT feature on Cisco IOS XE Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of PPTP packets to traverse a vulnerable system that is configured for NAT.      A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a system to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh19936](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh19936) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5545.         **Cisco IOS XE Software TCP Segment Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability**   A vulnerability in TCP segment reassembly of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of large TCP reassembled packets that are being processed by NAT and ALG features on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a TCP packet that is large after the reassembly to traverse a vulnerable device. Only packets being handled by NAT and ALG features have a potential to cause an affected device to reload. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCud72509](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud72509) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5546.         **Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed EoGRE Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability**   A vulnerability in the EoGRE feature of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper processing of malformed EoGRE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IPv4 or IPv6 EoGRE packets to an affected device configured with an EoGRE interface; this vulnerability cannot be exploited by sending malformed EoGRE packets to traverse a vulnerable system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuf08269](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf08269) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5547.
