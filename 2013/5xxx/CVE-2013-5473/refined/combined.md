| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software Internet Key Exchange Memory Leak Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20130925-ike  First Published: 2013 September 25 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCtx66011](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx66011)     CVE-2013-5473     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2013-5473     CWE-399       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-ike/oval/cisco-sa-20130925-ike_474.xml)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that could lead to a device reload.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsAlthough only IKEv1 packets can be used to trigger this vulnerability, devices that are running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable when they are configured to use IKEv1 or IKEv2.      Configuring IKEv2 on Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software automatically enables IKEv1.      A number of features use IKEv1, including different types of VPNs such as the following:   + LAN-to-LAN VPN   + Remote access VPN (excluding SSLVPN)   + Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN)   + Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)   The preferred method to determine whether a device has been configured for IKE is to issue the **show ip sockets** or **show udp** EXEC command. If the device has UDP port 500, UDP port 4500, or UDP port 848 open, it is processing IKE packets.      In the following example, the device is processing IKE packets in UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500, using either IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6):          ```   router# show udp Proto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF  17       --listen--          192.168.130.21    500   0   0 1001011   0   17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN           500   0   0 1020011   0   17       --listen--          192.168.130.21   4500   0   0 1001011   0   17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN          4500   0   0 1020011   0  !--- Output truncated router#   ```  To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The IKE protocol is used in the IP Security (IPsec) protocol suite to negotiate cryptographic attributes that will be used to encrypt or authenticate the communication session. These attributes include cryptographic algorithm, mode, and shared keys. The result of IKE is a shared session secret that will be used to derive cryptographic keys.      Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software support IKE for IPv4 and IPv6 communications. IKE communication can use any of the following UDP ports:   + UDP port 500   + UDP port 4500, Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal (NAT-T)   + UDP port 848, Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI)A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that could lead to a device reload.      The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed IKE packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKE packets to a device configured with features that leverage IKE version 1 (IKEv1).      Although IKEv1 is automatically enabled on a Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software when IKEv1 or IKE version 2 (IKEv2) is configured, the vulnerability can be triggered only by sending a malformed IKEv1 packet.      In specific conditions, normal IKEv1 packets can also cause an affected release of Cisco IOS Software to leak memory.      Only IKEv1 is affected by this vulnerability.      An exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software not to release allocated memory, causing a memory leak. A sustained attack may result in a device reload.   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using either IPv4 or IPv6 on any of the listed UDP ports.       How to Determine Whether the Vulnerability Has Been ExploitedTo determine whether the vulnerability has been exploited on an affected device, issue the **show memory debug leaks summary** command from the command-line interface.      The following example shows the output of an affected Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE device where there are observed memory leaks in IKE FSM CONTEXT:        ```   Router#show memory debug leaks summaryAdding blocks for GD...                 I/O memory                 Alloc PC        Size     Blocks      Bytes    What                 Processor memory                 Alloc PC        Size     Blocks      Bytes    What0x651A3D38 0000000092 0000000005 0000000460    IKE FSM CONTEXT0x651A3D38 0000000104 0000000002 0000000208    IKE FSM CONTEXT0x651A3D38 0000000112 0000000002 0000000224    IKE FSM CONTEXT0x651A3D38 0000000156 0000000002 0000000312    IKE FSM CONTEXT   ```    **Note:** The **show memory debug leaks summary** commandmay be CPU intensive and should be used with caution.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtx66011](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx66011) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5473.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.      The following identification mechanism exists for this vulnerability.Embedded Event Manager (EEM)A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect a memory leak that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the memory for the affected process on a Cisco IOS device. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade or reload the device to recover the lost memory at a suitable time. The example policy is based on a Tcl script that sends a syslog message when the memory keeps dropping and reaches EEM\_IKE\_BUFF\_INCR\_THRES and when the IKE buffers have dropped EEM\_IKE\_BUFF\_INCR\_THRES times. If IKE buffers are freed the counter starts counting from zero. After generating the memory leak syslog message the script re-initializes.    The Tcl script is available for download in [Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community](https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-30300).      A sample device configuration follows:       ```   event manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_INTERVAL 20event manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_MAX_RUNTIME 5event manager environment EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES 3event manager environment EEM_FREE_MEMORY_THRES 70event manager directory user policy "flash:/"event manager policy eem_ike_mem_leak.tcl   ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.
