{
  "CVE-2013-5029": {
    "Description": "phpMyAdmin has a number of mechanisms to avoid a clickjacking attack, however these mechanisms either work only in modern browser versions, or can be bypassed.",
    "Root cause": "The application's clickjacking protection mechanisms are insufficient and can be bypassed due to reliance on browser-specific features or ineffective implementations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient clickjacking protection",
      "Bypassable frame-breaking mechanisms",
      "Reliance on X-Frame-Options which has limitations and inconsistencies in browser support",
       "Lack of robust frame busting techniques"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to embed phpMyAdmin within a frame on a malicious site, potentially leading to users unknowingly performing actions on the phpMyAdmin interface (clickjacking).",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Embedding phpMyAdmin in an iframe on a malicious website",
      "Manipulating the user to interact with the framed phpMyAdmin interface"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage and have a user visit that page."
