The provided content is a security bulletin that includes CVE-2013-5465 among other vulnerabilities affecting multiple IBM products.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The bulletin does not provide specifics on the root cause for CVE-2013-5465 itself. However, it indicates that this CVE is part of a set of vulnerabilities including HTTP Response Splitting, Information Disclosure, SQL Injection, Security Bypass, Inadequate/Poor Input Control, Cross Site Scripting, and Gain Privileges vulnerabilities. This suggests a variety of different underlying causes for these vulnerabilities, with at least one relating to improper handling of input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** This specific vulnerability is mentioned as being addressed with APAR IV46511, alongside others within a set including: HTTP Response Splitting, Information Disclosure, SQL Injection, Security Bypass, Inadequate/Poor Input Control, Cross Site Scripting, and Gain Privileges vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:** The bulletin indicates the potential for a successful attack if these vulnerabilities are left unpatched. It doesn't specify the impact of exploiting each vulnerability individually, but the list of weaknesses suggests potential for:
    * Data breaches due to information disclosure
    * System compromise through SQL injection or privilege escalation
    * Defacement or malicious code execution via cross-site scripting (XSS)

**Attack Vectors:** The bulletin does not specify attack vectors for individual CVEs, but based on the vulnerabilities listed in the report, potential attack vectors would include:
    * Sending crafted HTTP requests to trigger HTTP response splitting.
    * Sending crafted requests to exploit SQL injection.
    * Injecting malicious code through poorly sanitized user input, leading to XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The bulletin does not specify attacker capabilities/position, but based on the vulnerabilities listed in the report, an attacker would likely need:
        * Network access to the affected systems
        * Ability to send HTTP requests to the server, possibly requiring prior knowledge of system architecture
        * Ability to craft malicious requests for SQL injection

The bulletin emphasizes the need to apply fixes as soon as possible and suggests mitigations, like restricting network protocols or removing privileges from unprivileged users, but acknowledges these may break application functionality and are not long-term solutions.
