{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The phpcms guestbook module does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the guestbook. When an administrator views the guestbook message in the admin control panel, the injected JavaScript code will execute in their browser session. This could allow the attacker to perform malicious actions such as stealing session cookies or performing actions on behalf of the administrator.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a POST request to `/index.php?m=guestbook&c=index&a=register&siteid=1` with malicious JavaScript code within the `title` and `introduce` parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit a guestbook entry on the vulnerable website."
