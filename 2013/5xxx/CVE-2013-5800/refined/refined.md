{
  "CVE-2013-5800": {
    "description": "The Kerberos implementation in OpenJDK did not properly parse KDC responses. A malformed packet could cause a Java application using JGSS to exit. Additionally, the JGSS component of OpenJDK could possibly leak information via exceptions, which an untrusted Java application or applet could use to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions and determine the path of the default keytab file.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information disclosure via exceptions",
      "Insufficient parsing of KDC responses"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure of the default keytab file path, and a potential denial of service by crashing Java applications using JGSS.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker sending a malformed Kerberos KDC response packet to a Java application using JGSS",
      "Untrusted Java application or applet triggering exceptions via the JGSS component."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker would require the ability to send malformed Kerberos packets, and to trigger a Java application to call toString() on an affected class.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient parsing of Kerberos KDC responses and information leakage via exceptions in the JGSS component of OpenJDK. The toString() method of some classes exposed sensitive data."
