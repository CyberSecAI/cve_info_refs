  "exploitabilityScore": "N/A",
  "attackVector": "Network",
  "attackComplexity": "Low",
  "privilegesRequired": "None",
  "userInteraction": "Required",
  "scope": "Unchanged",
  "confidentialityImpact": "None",
  "integrityImpact": "None",
  "availabilityImpact": "Partial",
  "vulnerabilityDescription": "The vulnerability is due to the use of arithmetic prone to overflow in JavaScript binary search algorithms. Specifically, the calculation `(lo+hi)/2` can lead to an integer overflow when `lo` and `hi` are large numbers.",
  "affectedSoftware": [
    {
      "name": "Mozilla Firefox",
      "versions": [
        "All versions before 26"
      ]
    },

      "name": "Mozilla SeaMonkey",
      "versions": [
        "All versions before 2.23"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "rootCause": "Integer overflow in the calculation used for binary search algorithms.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Integer Overflow"
  ],
  "impact": "A potential out-of-bounds array access that can lead to a denial-of-service. It's also theoretically possible to craft an exploit to gain arbitrary code execution from this vulnerability.",
  "attackVectors": [
    "A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page"
  ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to get a user to load a malicious web page or email.",
   "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability exists within the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine used by Firefox and SeaMonkey. The patch changes the calculation to `lo+(hi-lo)/2` to avoid integer overflows."
