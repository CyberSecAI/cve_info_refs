Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The D-Link DSL-2740B router's web-based configuration interface (Web-GUI) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The web interface lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks, allowing an attacker to execute unauthorized actions on the router via a logged-in user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can change router parameters, causing modifications to the router's configuration.
*   The attacker can cause the router to become unreliable, impacting network connectivity and potentially other services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link or browsing a compromised site.
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks could also be used to inject malicious requests.
*   The attack is primarily from the LAN side, but enabling Remote Management expands the attack surface to the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to convince a user who is logged into the router's web interface to perform an action that triggers the malicious request.
*   The attacker needs to have some mechanism to deliver the malicious request to the user, such as a link in an email or compromised website.
*   The attacker must be able to target a user on the same network (LAN), or if remote management is enabled, from the internet.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vendor acknowledges the vulnerability and is releasing a firmware update to correct it.
*   The advisory recommends disabling the Remote Management feature to reduce the attack surface.
*   The advisory provides a description of the CSRF attack, how to mitigate it by not opening unsolicited links and how to update the router firmware.
*   The advisory mentions CVE-2013-2271 which is an authentication bypass vulnerability, which requires similar conditions to exploit.
