Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-5056

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by memory corruption due to the Microsoft Scripting Runtime Object Library improperly handling an object in memory. Specifically, it is a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Use-after-free vulnerability in the Microsoft Scripting Runtime Object Library (scrrun.dll)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution.
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system.
- The attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through components of Internet Explorer.
- The attacker can convince a user to visit this website, typically through a link in an email or instant message.
- Compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content/ads can also be used to deliver the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website that a target user is likely to visit.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website (e.g., through social engineering, phishing).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects various versions of Windows Script (5.6, 5.7, and 5.8) on different operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows RT and Windows RT 8.1
- The update modifies how the Microsoft Scripting Runtime Object Library handles objects in memory to prevent the use-after-free.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index rated this vulnerability as "Exploitation More Likely" within 30 days of the bulletin's release.
- Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate attacks on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.
-  Internet Explorer running in Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows servers mitigates the vulnerability if the website is not in the Trusted sites zone.
- Microsoft was not aware of any active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the bulletin's release.
