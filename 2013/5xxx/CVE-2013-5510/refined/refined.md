- Improper parsing of the LDAP response packet received from a remote AAA LDAP server when the `override-account-disable` option is configured in the general-attributes of the tunnel-group.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication bypass in the remote access VPN feature of Cisco ASA Software.
- The vulnerability is triggered by specific configuration where the `override-account-disable` option is enabled along with LDAP authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can bypass the remote VPN authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends traffic to the affected system.
- The attacker attempts to authenticate via remote VPN using an affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to target a Cisco ASA device configured for remote access VPN.
- The remote VPN must be authenticated via a remote AAA server using LDAP.
- The `override-account-disable` option must be configured under the tunnel-group general-attributes settings.
- The attacker must know a valid username to exploit this vulnerability.
- For IKEv1 Remote IPsec VPN and L2TP/IPsec VPN, the attacker must also have knowledge of the tunnel-group password or hold a valid digital certificate.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN, IKEv1 and IKEv2 Remote IPsec VPN, and L2TP/IPsec VPN.
- The vulnerability only affects routed firewall mode in single context mode.
- It can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- The vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCug83401.
