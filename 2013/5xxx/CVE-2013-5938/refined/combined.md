Subject: RE: Re: CVE duplicates SA-CONTRIB-2013-075

Note that with two CNAs handling already-public issues, there are multiple ways that duplicates can arise.  This risk grows as MITRE's output increases.  On the MITRE side, we are revisiting our procedures for reducing the number of duplicates.  We already privately identified the increased duplicate risk with Kurt and will work with him to make things more manageable.

For this specific situation: MITRE processed the Drupal advisories on September 25, creating new CVEs that were thus available in NVD at approximately 11 AM Eastern time.  Forest's request to oss-security happened on September 26.  Kurt's response to oss-security was on September 27.  So in this case, there were multiple opportunities for requesters to check for pre-existing CVEs in NVD.

The MITRE-assigned CVE-2013-5937 and CVE-2013-5938 are in more active use and were published first, so they will be kept.

REJECT CVE-2013-4381 as a duplicate of CVE-2013-5938.

REJECT CVE-2013-4382 as a duplicate of CVE-2013-5937.

Forest, please update the advisory to use the MITRE-assigned numbers.

- Steve

# [Security-news] SA-CONTRIB-2013-075 - Click2Sell - Multiple Vulnerabilities (XSS and CSRF)

---

*From*: security-news () drupal org

*Date*: Wed, 11 Sep 2013 20:42:20 +0000 (UTC)

---

```
View online: <https://drupal.org/node/2087055>

  * Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-CONTRIB-2013-075
  * Project: Click2Sell Suite [1] (third-party module)
  * Version: 6.x
  * Date: 2013-September-11
  * Security risk: Highly critical [2]
  * Exploitable from: Remote
  * Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery

-------- DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------

Click2Sell is an Affiliate Marketing Network which lets you sell your
products through their marketplace or on your website with buy it now
buttons, and which also allows you to access hundreds of affiliates who want
to sell your product for you and earn commission.

.... Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

The module doesn't sufficiently filter user supplied data when presenting a
confirmation form.

.... Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

The module doesn't properly use Drupal's Form API which allows a malicious
user to trick an admin into accidentally deleting information from
Click2Sell's database.

-------- CVE IDENTIFIER(S) ISSUED
--------------------------------------------

  * /A CVE identifier [3] will be requested, and added upon issuance, in
    accordance with Drupal Security Team processes./

-------- VERSIONS AFFECTED
---------------------------------------------------

  * All Click2Sell Suite 6.x-1.x versions.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Click2Sell
Suite [4] module, there is nothing you need to do.

-------- SOLUTION
------------------------------------------------------------

  * If you use the Click2Sell Suite module for Drupal 6.x you should disable
    it.

Also see the Click2Sell Suite [5] project page.

-------- REPORTED BY
---------------------------------------------------------

  * Greg Knaddison [6] of the Drupal Security Team

-------- FIXED BY
------------------------------------------------------------

Not applicable.

-------- CONTACT AND MORE INFORMATION
----------------------------------------

The Drupal security team can be reached at security at drupal.org or via the
contact form at <http://drupal.org/contact> [7].

Learn more about the Drupal Security team and their policies [8], writing
secure code for Drupal [9], and securing your site [10].

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
