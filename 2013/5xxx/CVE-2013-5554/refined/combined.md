| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco WAAS Mobile Remote Code Execution Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20131106-waasm  First Published: 2013 November 6 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuh69773](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh69773)     CVE-2013-5554     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.5, Temporal 6.2](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2013-5554     CWE-20       Email      Summary  * Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Mobile contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Cisco WAAS Mobile server with the privileges of the Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco WAAS Mobile server versions prior to 3.5.5 are affected by this vulnerability.      The software version of a Cisco WAAS Mobile server can be determined by first accessing the web administration interface. The software version number is located on the right side of the header.   Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products running Cisco WAAS Software are not affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco WAAS   + Cisco WAAS Express **Note:** this vulnerability does not affect the Cisco WAAS Mobile software component installed on the clients.    No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco WAAS Mobile extends Cisco WAAS software application acceleration benefits to teleworkers, small and home office workers, and mobile employees who travel outside the branch office.      A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco WAAS Mobile server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data in the body of an HTTP POST request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP POST request for content upload that would result in an uncontrolled directory traversal. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the WAAS Mobile server with the privileges of the IIS web server.      **Note:** The vulnerable component belongs to the web management interface; however, in a deployment where more than one Cisco WAAS Mobile server is used then all the servers are vulnerable, not just the one performing the Manager role and hosting the web management interface.   **Note:** This vulnerability does not affect the software component installed on the clients.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh69773](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh69773) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5554  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * This vulnerability has been fixed in Cisco WAAS Mobile version 3.5.5 and later.      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.2 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.2 |
