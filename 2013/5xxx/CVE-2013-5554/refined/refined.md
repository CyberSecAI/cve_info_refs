Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5554:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied data within the web management interface of Cisco WAAS Mobile server, specifically in the body of an HTTP POST request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Directory Traversal:** An attacker can craft an HTTP POST request for content upload that results in a directory traversal, allowing them to access files and directories outside of the intended web server root.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The web management interface fails to properly validate user-supplied data, specifically within the HTTP POST request, allowing for the directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Cisco WAAS Mobile server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the privileges of the Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server, which could lead to further system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring any prior authentication.
- **HTTP POST Request:** Attackers craft malicious HTTP POST requests to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Directory Traversal:** The attack leverages directory traversal techniques within the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Cisco WAAS Mobile server.
- **Ability to craft HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to create and send custom HTTP POST requests.
- **No Credentials Required:** No prior authentication or valid credentials are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco WAAS Mobile server versions prior to 3.5.5.
- The vulnerability exists within the web management interface of the server.
- All Cisco WAAS Mobile servers in a deployment are vulnerable, not just the one performing the Manager role.
- The vulnerability does not affect the Cisco WAAS Mobile software component installed on clients.
- The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Andrea Micalizzi (rgod), working with HP's Zero Day Initiative.
- There are no known workarounds. The only fix is upgrading to a version >=3.5.5.
- The CVSS score was calculated to be 7.5 (Base) and 6.2 (Temporal). The CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C
