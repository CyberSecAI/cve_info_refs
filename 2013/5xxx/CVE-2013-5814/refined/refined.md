Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5814:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, especially the Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2013:1440 and RHSA-2013:1505, explicitly mentions CVE-2013-5814 as one of the vulnerabilities fixed in the corresponding updates for java-1.7.0-oracle and java-1.6.0-openjdk. Furthermore, the bugzilla entry confirms that the vulnerability is related to OpenJDK's RMIConnection stub and itâ€™s lacking permission checks. Therefore, the content is directly related to CVE-2013-5814.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2013-5814 is a missing permission check in the `RMIConnection` stub within the CORBA component of OpenJDK. This oversight allows an attacker to potentially bypass security restrictions.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Permission Check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a proper permission check on the `RMIConnection` stub. This means that operations that should be restricted were not being vetted.
- **Inadequate Security:** In general, there's a lack of robust security checks within the CORBA component of OpenJDK that the vulnerability exposes.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sandbox Bypass:** The most significant impact is the potential for an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass the Java sandbox restrictions, which normally isolates applets and untrusted code from the host operating system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By bypassing the sandbox, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Java Virtual Machine. This could lead to complete system compromise or other unauthorized actions.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Due to missing checks a malicious actor could be able to modify group threads which is a form of privilege escalation

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Untrusted Java Applets/Applications:**  The attack vector involves an untrusted Java applet or application, making web-based attacks a high possibility if a user browses to a malicious page or a malicious applet is loaded.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious Java applet or application to a user, typically via a web browser.
- **No User Authentication Needed:** It does not require user authentication because the vulnerability lies in the improper permission checks.
- **Malicious Code Development**: The attacker would need to craft code to exploit this vulnerability.

**7. Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions, highlighting the widespread impact of this issue.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in updated `java-1.7.0-oracle` and `java-1.6.0-openjdk` packages.
*   The bugzilla entry also mentions that it is fixed in  IcedTea7 2.4.3 and IcedTea6 1.11.14 and 1.12.7.

In summary, CVE-2013-5814 is a critical vulnerability stemming from a missing permission check in the CORBA RMIConnection stub within OpenJDK. It allows sandbox bypass and potentially allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code which makes it a high severity vulnerability.
