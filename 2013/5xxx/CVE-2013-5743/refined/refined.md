- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization in the Zabbix frontend and API allows for SQL injection attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerabilities in various API methods and frontend functionalities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain access to the database and execute arbitrary SQL statements.
- **Attack vectors:** Vulnerable API methods include `alert.get`, `event.get`, `graphitem.get`, `graph.get`, `graphprototype.get`, `history.get`, `trigger.get`, `triggerprototype.get`, and `usergroup.get`. Frontend vulnerabilities exist in the code for adding objects to favorites on pages such as "Dashboard", "Graphs", "Maps", "Latest data", and "Screens".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Attackers need to be able to send requests to the vulnerable API endpoints or interact with the vulnerable frontend components.
