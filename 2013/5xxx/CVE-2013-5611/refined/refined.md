Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-5611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in how Firefox handles the "Application Installation" doorhanger notification when a page navigates to a different page immediately after calling `navigator.mozApps.install()`. The doorhanger, which prompts the user to install a web application, persists even after the page navigation, instead of being dismissed. This is due to a race condition where the location change event is processed before the install notification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **UI persistence:** The "Install App" doorhanger remains visible even when the page has navigated away. This means the doorhanger is not associated with the current displayed page.
- **Spoofing/Clickjacking:** A malicious site could exploit this by initiating an app installation and then immediately redirecting the user to another page. This would trick the user into believing the app is being installed from the new page when it's actually from the malicious one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Deception:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to trick users into installing apps they might not have installed if they had been aware of the true origin.
- **Malicious App Installation:** Users may inadvertently install a malicious application believing it came from a trusted source.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a specially crafted webpage that calls the `navigator.mozApps.install()` method and immediately redirects to a different page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage that can execute JavaScript code within a vulnerable Firefox browser.
- No special privileges or user interaction other than visiting the malicious webpage are required.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mozilla developer Myk Melez.
- The fix involved ensuring the doorhanger is dismissed when the page navigates away.
- The fix includes verification to ensure the doorhanger is associated with a valid window.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox versions prior to 26.
- The vulnerability was considered a "moderate" security issue.
