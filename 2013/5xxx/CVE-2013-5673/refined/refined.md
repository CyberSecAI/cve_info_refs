Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-5673:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `IndiaNIC Testimonial` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin unsafely incorporates user-supplied data into a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The plugin constructs a SQL query using the `custom_query` parameter without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the WordPress database.
*   This can lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration (extracting sensitive data).
    *   Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data).
    *   Potentially gaining complete control over the database and, consequently, the website.
    *   In the provided examples, the attacker was able to extract the database version by injecting `1=1) union select 1,2,3,@@version,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14#`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a specially crafted `custom_query` parameter when adding or editing a listing template.
*   Specifically, the vulnerable code is within the `iNIC_testimonial_save_listing_template` action, where the `custom_query` parameter is directly inserted into a SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site's `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   The attacker must have administrative privileges or be able to trick an administrator into performing the request (CSRF). Note that the content indicates that CSRF was also a vulnerability, and could be used to perform the SQLi attack.
*   The attacker needs to know that the `IndiaNIC Testimonial` plugin is installed and vulnerable.
*   While the provided examples show a direct POST request, the vulnerability is exploitable through the administrative interface, indicating that CSRF could allow an attacker with lower privileges to induce the SQLi.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `testimonial.php` file of the plugin.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```php
    if ($_template_data['custom_query']) {
        $filter_by = " AND ({$_template_data['custom_query']})";
    }

    $_testimonial_result = $this->wpdb->get_results(
    "SELECT * FROM {$this->wpdb->prefix}inic_testimonial WHERE (id NOT IN(" .
    implode(",", $_current_featured_testimonial_id) . ")){$filter_by}
    ORDER BY {$_template_data['ord_by']} LIMIT {$_no_of_testimonial}");
    ```

*   The plugin version affected is 2.2.
*   The exploit-db entry also refers to CVE-2013-5672 for a related CSRF vulnerability.
