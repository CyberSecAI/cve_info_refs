## Ruckus Wireless Zoneflex 2942 Wireless Access Point vulnerable to authentication bypass

#### Vulnerability Note VU#742932

Original Release Date: 2013-10-10 | Last Revised: 2013-10-10

---

### Overview

Ruckus Wireless Zoneflex 2942 Wireless Access Point version 9.6.0.0.267 and possibly earlier versions contains an authentication bypass vulnerability (CWE-592).

### Description

| [**CWE-592**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/592.html)**: Authentication Bypass Issues**  Ruckus Wireless Zoneflex 2942 Wireless Access Point version 9.6.0.0.267 contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. A local unauthenticated attacker may attempt to login with any credentials and after receiving the authentication failure message, the user can remove the /login.asp portion of the URI to bypass the login page. The attacker will not be able to browse to the other configuration pages of the device via the graphical user interface, but they can then manually edit the URI to gain access to the following pages:/configuration/wireless.asp/configuration/local\_network.asp/configuration/internet.asp/configuration/device.asp/maintenance/upgrade.asp/maintenance/reboot.asp |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker may be able to directly access the device's configuration web pages. The attacker may also be able to reboot the access point, resulting in a denial of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. Please consider the following workarounds. |
| --- |

| **Restrict network access**Restrict network access to the Ruckus Wireless Zoneflex 2942 Wireless Access Point web interface and other devices using open protocols like HTTP.**Disable WAN device management**Restrict network access to the Ruckus Wireless Zoneflex 2942 Wireless Access Point web interface from Internet connections. |
