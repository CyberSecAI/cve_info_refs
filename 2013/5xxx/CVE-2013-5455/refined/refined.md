- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the command line interface of IBM Service Agility Accelerator for Cloud.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper authorization checks, allowing users with read-only access to perform actions like starting, stopping, and deleting virtual systems.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can start, stop, or delete virtual systems, potentially leading to service disruption or data loss.
- **Attack vectors:** Command line interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any user with read-only access to the system through the command line interface.
