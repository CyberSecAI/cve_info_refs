- SQL Injection: The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially view, add, modify, or delete information in the back-end database. This can lead to data breaches, data corruption, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: A remote attacker can send specially crafted SQL statements through the application's interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to exploit this vulnerability.
