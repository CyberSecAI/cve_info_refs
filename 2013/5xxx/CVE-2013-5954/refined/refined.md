Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5954:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the extensive use of HTTP GET methods in the Revive Adserver web console for deleting data or unlinking accounts, instead of using HTTP POST. These GET calls lacked protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is CSRF. The application didn't properly validate the origin of the requests that were used to perform actions, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
- **Unprotected GET requests:** The application used GET requests to perform state-changing operations, such as deleting data. This is bad practice and contributed to the exploitable vulnerability.
- **Lack of session token validation:** The application failed to include session tokens in GET requests or validate them, allowing malicious actors to trick logged-in users into performing unwanted actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data loss:** Attackers could trick authenticated users into deleting various types of data, including users, advertisers, banners, campaigns, channels, websites, zones, trackers and user logs.
- **Service disruption:** The deletion of critical data could lead to service disruptions.
- **Unauthorized modification:** Although the advisory states the vulnerability doesn't allow remote users to access the console or otherwise modify data, the deletion actions could effectively cause data modification, potentially allowing attackers to disrupt the ad serving system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is via crafted URLs in various forms (e.g. email, links, websites).
- An attacker would need to lure a logged-in user to interact with a malicious link or page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, but needs a user that is logged into the Revive Adserver console to click a malicious link or visit a malicious web page.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs that trigger the deletion functions when accessed by a logged-in user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found to be more widespread than initially reported.
- The issue was also present in older versions of OpenX Source and potentially even phpAdsNew.
- The fix involved adding a session token validation to the GET requests and using a helper function in the templates.
- The advisory provides a list of specific files that were affected by the vulnerability.

The provided content also contains code diffs showing how the vulnerability was fixed by adding session token validation.
