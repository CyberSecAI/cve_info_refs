- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the potential for reuse of One Time Password (OTP) tokens provided by IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the insufficient enforcement or handling of OTP tokens, which allows for their potential reuse under certain unspecified conditions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms that rely on one-time passwords, potentially gaining unauthorized access to systems or resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector isn't detailed, but it involves the reuse of OTP tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document doesn't specify required attacker capabilities, but it implies the attacker needs access to a used OTP token and a way to re-submit it.
