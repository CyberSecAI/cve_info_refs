{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient safeguards against cross-site request forgery.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can trick a legitimate user into opening a URL that results in an action being taken as that user, potentially without the user's knowledge. Any actions taken require the legitimate user to be already authenticated or to authenticate separately as part of the attack.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trick a legitimate user into opening a malicious URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a legitimate user into opening it. The legitimate user must be already authenticated or authenticate as part of the attack."
