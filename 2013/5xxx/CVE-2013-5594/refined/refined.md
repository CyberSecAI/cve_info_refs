Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2013-5594:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the way Mozilla Firefox handles XML pretty printing, specifically how it interacts with XBL (XML Binding Language). The vulnerability stems from the ability to modify the anonymous content of the `pluginProblem.xml` binding. This is due to the fact that the XML pretty-printing mechanism can be exploited to bypass Same-Origin Wrappers (SOWs), allowing modification of the normally protected anonymous content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bypassing Same-Origin Wrappers (SOWs):** The XML pretty-printing functionality could be abused to circumvent the intended security restrictions imposed by SOWs. This allows access to and modification of elements that should be protected.
*   **Modification of Anonymous Content:** Attackers could modify the content within `pluginProblem.xml`, a file intended to display plugin-related error messages. This can lead to manipulation of the UI or, when combined with other vulnerabilities, more serious attacks.
*   **Potential for Clickjacking:** Modifying `pluginProblem` could be used to perform clickjacking attacks.
*   **Assertion Failures:** The initial report noted the ability to trigger assertion failures when touching NAC (Native Anonymous Content) due to lack of test coverage in this area, which can be a symptom of the underlying vulnerability or a related problem. Although those crashes are related, they're not the same bug as the main issue described.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **UI Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the user interface by altering the content of `pluginProblem.xml`, which could lead to misleading or deceptive displays.
*   **Clickjacking:** The vulnerability could be used to overlay malicious content over the legitimate plugin error message UI, tricking users into unintended actions.
*   **System compromise** By gaining access to internal browser components, other more advanced attacks might be performed

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector involves exploiting the XML pretty-printing functionality to access and modify anonymous content. The vulnerability can be triggered by content loaded into the browser, indicating a web-based vector, and does not require local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft or manipulate web content that can trigger the XML pretty printing functionality to access the anonymous content. This could be achieved by hosting a malicious page or injecting malicious code into a vulnerable website.
*   No elevated privileges are required from the user.
*   The attacker would need some understanding of XBL bindings and XML pretty printing in Firefox.

**Additional Information from Bugzilla:**

*   The bug was initially reported as related to `document.getAnonymousNodes` but was determined to be a separate issue.
*   The fix involved reimplementing XML pretty printing using events to prevent the bypass of SOWs.
*   The vulnerability was classified as "sec-high" due to its potential security impact and was addressed in Firefox versions 25, 26, 27 and ESR24.
*   Patches were created and approved for various branches (Aurora, Beta, ESR24).
*   The fix was determined to not be applicable to older branches such as b2g18 and ESR17 due to architecture differences and the lack of XBL scopes which make the fix less effective.
