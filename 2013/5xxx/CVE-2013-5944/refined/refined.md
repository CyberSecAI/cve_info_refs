- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server authentication mechanism of affected SCALANCE X-200 and X-200IRT switches is flawed, allowing unauthenticated access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing Authentication (CWE-952). The web server does not properly enforce authentication, allowing access to administrative functionalities without credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can perform administrative operations over the network without authentication, potentially gaining full control of the affected devices. This includes the ability to change configurations, disrupt network operations, and potentially use the device as a launchpad for further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable SCALANCE X-200 switches. No prior authentication or specialized access is required.
