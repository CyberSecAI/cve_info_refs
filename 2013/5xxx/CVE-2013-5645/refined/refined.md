Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability that existed in Roundcube Webmail. Specifically, there were two XSS vulnerabilities that were fixed in this update:
    * XSS vulnerability when saving HTML signatures
    * XSS vulnerability when editing a message "as new" or draft

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into HTML signatures or when editing/drafting messages.
*   **Account Compromise:** The injected script could be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on the user's behalf.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information displayed in the user's webmail interface or modify the content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTML Signatures:** An attacker could insert malicious scripts within their HTML signature. When a user views an email from the attacker, or edits their own signature, the script would execute.
*   **Message Editing:** When a user edits a message as new, or is working on a draft, they could also be vulnerable to exploitation if the draft contains malicious code. 

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Emails/Modify Content:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the target (in the case of HTML signatures) or be able to trick a user into editing a message/draft containing malicious code to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and know how to craft malicious scripts that can be injected.
