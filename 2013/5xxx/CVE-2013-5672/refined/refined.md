Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-5672:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the lack of proper input sanitization and security checks within the IndiaNIC Testimonial WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin is vulnerable to CSRF, XSS, and SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CWE-352:** The plugin's forms, specifically the "add testimonial", "add listings template", and "add widget template" forms, lack CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79:** The same forms are vulnerable to XSS due to improper handling of user-supplied input. This enables an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the user's browser.
- **SQL Injection (SQLi) - CWE-89:** The "add listings template" form is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `custom_query` parameter. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF:** An attacker can use CSRF to perform actions as a logged-in admin, such as adding, editing, or deleting testimonials, listing templates or widget templates. This can lead to defacement of the website, loss of data, or unauthorized modification of content.
- **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript which could redirect users to phishing pages, steal cookies, or perform actions within the admin interface on behalf of the logged-in administrator.
- **SQLi:** An attacker can use SQL injection to gain access to sensitive data, modify the database, or potentially gain full control of the database server. In this specific case, the attacker can extract database version information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF:** The attack vector for CSRF involves tricking a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted form. This can be achieved through malicious links, or by embedding the malicious form within another website.
- **XSS:** The attack vector for XSS is through injecting malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable form fields. This code will then execute in the administrator's browser session.
- **SQLi:** The attack vector for SQLi is through crafting a malicious SQL query using the custom_query parameter in the "add listings template" form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **CSRF:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into interacting with a malicious link or form.
- **XSS:** The attacker needs to inject malicious script through form fields.
- **SQLi:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious SQL query and submit it through the `custom_query` parameter of the "add listings template" form.

**Additional Details:**

*   The identified vulnerabilities are present in version 2.2 of the IndiaNIC Testimonial WordPress plugin.
*   The vendor was notified but did not release a patch.
*   The content contains proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrating how to exploit each vulnerability, using simple javascript alerts for XSS and an SQL query extracting the database version.
