Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2013-5642:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the SIP channel driver of Asterisk.
- It occurs when an invalid Session Description Protocol (SDP) is received in a SIP request.
- Specifically, the issue arises if the SDP contains media descriptions *before* connection information. The code attempts to access socket address information before it has been set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper handling of SDP:** The SIP channel driver doesn't correctly validate the order of information in SDP.
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** When processing a media description, the code attempts to set the port of a socket address, but the socket address is NULL because the connection information (which would initialize the socket address) has not been processed yet, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Crash:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a crash of the Asterisk server. This results in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SIP Request:** The attack is triggered by sending a specially crafted SIP request containing an invalid SDP.
- **Remote Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send arbitrary SIP requests to an Asterisk server. This can be done from outside of a local network if the Asterisk server is exposed to the internet.
- The attacker needs to construct a SIP message with a specially crafted SDP as described in the root cause.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the issue is in the `process_sdp` function of the `chan_sip.c` file.
- Patches for the vulnerability add checks to handle media descriptions only when appropriate connection information is present.
- The issue is present in Asterisk versions 1.8.x, 10.x and 11.x.
