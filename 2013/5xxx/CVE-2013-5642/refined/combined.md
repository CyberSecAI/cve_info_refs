Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2013-005

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Remote Crash when Invalid SDP is sent in SIP Request |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Remote Crash |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Unauthenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Major |
| **Exploits Known** | None |
| **Reported On** | July 03, 2013 |
| **Reported By** | Walter Doekes, OSSO B.V. |
| **Posted On** | August 27, 2013 |
| **Last Updated On** | August 28, 2013 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Matthew Jordan <mjordan AT digium DOT com> |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2013-5642 |

| **Description** | A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the SIP channel driver if an invalid SDP is sent in a SIP request that defines media descriptions before connection information. The handling code incorrectly attempts to reference the socket address information even though that information has not yet been set. |

| **Resolution** | This patch adds checks when handling the various media descriptions that ensures the media descriptions are handled only if we have connection information suitable for that media.    Thanks to Walter Doekes of OSSO B.V. for finding, reporting, testing, and providing the fix for this problem. |

Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-5641 CVE-2013-5642

Colin Cuthbertson and Walter Doekes discovered two vulnerabilities in
the SIP processing code of Asterisk - an open source PBX and telephony
toolkit -, which could result in denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze11.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.13.1~dfsg-3+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
