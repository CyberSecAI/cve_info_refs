| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.9 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 5.9 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software Multicast Network Time Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20130925-ntp  First Published: 2013 September 25 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuc81226](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc81226)     CVE-2013-5472     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.1, Temporal 5.9](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2013-5472     CWE-399       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) feature in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsA Cisco device that is running an affected Cisco IOS Software release is vulnerable when the following two conditions are met:   + The device configuration includes any multicast NTP configuration commands   + The device has has at least one MSDP peer configuredThe following steps can be used to determine whether the device meets the preceding conditions:      The **show running-config | include ^interface|ntp multicast** privileged EXEC command can be used to determine whether the device configuration includes any multicast NTP configuration commands. The following is the output from the **show running-config | include ^interface|ntp multicast** command executed on a device running Cisco IOS Software that has multiple interfaces configured for multicast NTP: ```   Router#show running-config | include ^interface|ntp multicastinterface Loopback0interface Loopback1interface FastEthernet0/0 ntp multicastinterface FastEthernet0/1interface FastEthernet0/2interface FastEthernet0/3interface FastEthernet1/0 ntp multicast key 61560interface FastEthernet1/1interface FastEthernet1/2 ntp multicast clientinterface FastEthernet1/3 ntp multicast client ntp multicastRouter#   ``` Note: The next step can be skipped if the device does not have any multicast NTP commands in the configuration. The device is not vulnerable.      The **show ip msdp summary** privileged EXEC command can be used to determine whether the device has at least one MSDP peer configured. The following is the output from the **show ip msdp summary** command executed on a device running Cisco IOS Software that has one MSDP peer configured: ```   Router#show ip msdp summary    MSDP Peer Status Summary   Peer Address     AS    State    Uptime/  Reset SA    Peer Name                                   Downtime Count Count   10.54.54.54      ?     Up       00:35:03 0     6     ?   Router#      ``` A device without any MSDP peers configured is not vulnerable.      The processing of NTP multicast packets is not enabled by default.    To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are confirmed not to be affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco IOS XR Software.No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * NTP is designed to time-synchronize a network of machines. NTP runs on UDP, which is transported on IP. Networking devices running NTP can be configured to operate in a variety of association modes when synchronizing time with reference time sources. A networking device can obtain time information on a network in two ways: by polling host servers and by listening to NTP broadcasts.      A vulnerability in the implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) feature in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of multicast NTP packets that are sent to an affected device encapsulated in a Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) Source-Active (SA) message from a configured MSDP peer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multicast NTP packets to an affected device. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuc81226](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc81226) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5472  Workarounds  * Customers who do not require multicast NTP traffic from other multicast domains can configure an MSDP SA filter to drop the traffic coming from an MSDP peer and sent to the NTP multicast group. The following example shows an MSDP SA filter that will be applied to all MSDP traffic sent to the device from a configured MSDP peer with address 10.54.54.54  ```   access-list 111 remark -- Deny traffic from any source to the NTP multicast group   access-list 111 deny ip any host 224.0.1.1access-list 111 remark -- Allow everything elseaccess-list 111 permit ip any any   ip msdp sa-filter in 10.54.54.54 list 111   ``` Note: the previous MSDP SA filter will need to be applied to each and every MSDP peer configured on the device, and should be customized according to the specific environment.      Refer to <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk828/technologies_tech_note09186a0080093fda.shtml> for additional information on MSDP SA filtering recommendations.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.
