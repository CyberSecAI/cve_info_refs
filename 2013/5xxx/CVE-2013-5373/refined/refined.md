- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the IBM Rational ClearCase remote client command line script due to insecure file permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `rcleartool` and `rcleartool.conf` files have group and world write permissions, which allows unauthorized users to modify these files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could escalate their privileges by modifying the script or configuration file.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the file system of the host where the IBM Rational ClearCase remote client is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have write access to the affected files on a host with the RemoteClient installation, potentially through a compromised user account with local access.
