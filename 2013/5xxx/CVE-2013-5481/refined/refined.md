## Analysis of CVE-2013-5481

The provided content relates to CVE-2013-5481.

**Vulnerability Description:**

CVE-2013-5481 describes a vulnerability in the NAT implementation of Cisco IOS Software. Specifically, it is related to the improper handling of Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) packets. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by reloading the affected device.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability exists due to the improper handling of certain valid PPTP packets by the NAT function.

**Attack Vector:**

An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending specifically crafted PPTP packets on TCP port 1723 to a Cisco IOS device configured for NAT. NAT for PPTP involves TCP port 1723 and Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) packets on IP protocol 47. The vulnerability is triggered by PPTP packets on TCP port 1723.

**Impact:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, specifically a reload of the affected Cisco IOS device.

**Affected Products:**

Cisco devices running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS Software and configured for NAT are affected. Cisco IOS XE, IOS XR, NX-OS, and ASA Software are not affected.

**Mitigation:**

The primary mitigation is to upgrade to a fixed software release. The advisory lists specific fixed releases for various Cisco IOS software trains. There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
