| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software with the DHCP server or DHCP relay feature enabled are vulnerable. The DHCP server or DHCP relay feature is not enabled by default. Cisco devices that are configured as DHCP clients are not affected by this vulnerability.       To determine whether a Cisco IOS device or Cisco IOS XE device is configured as a DHCP server, issue the **show ip dhcp pool** command.       The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the DHCP server feature is enabled and the configured pool has at least one subnet that serves IP addresses:    ```   Router#show ip dhcp pool Pool test : Utilization mark (high/low)    : 100 / 0 Subnet size (first/next)       : 0 / 0  Total addresses                : 254 Leased addresses               : 0 Pending event                  : none 1 subnet is currently in the pool : Current index        IP address range                    Leased addresses 192.168.1.1          192.168.1.1      - 192.168.1.254         0   ```    To determine whether a Cisco IOS device or Cisco IOS XE device is configured as a DHCP relay agent, issue the **show run | include helper-address** command.       The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the DHCP relay agent feature is enabled, based on the **ip helper-address** output:    ```   Router#show run | include helper-address ip helper-address 10.1.1.2   ```  To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The DHCP server feature in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software is a DHCP server implementation that assigns and manages IP version 4 (IPv4) addresses, prefixes, and other information from specified address pools to DHCP clients.   A DHCP relay agent feature in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software forwards DHCP packets between clients and servers. Relay agents are used to forward requests and replies between clients and servers when they are not on the same physical subnet.      Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device that has the DHCP server or DHCP relay agent feature enabled, causing a reload.      The vulnerability is triggered when the affected Cisco IOS device attempts to process a crafted DHCP packet. Valid DHCP packets will not trigger this vulnerability. DHCP packets that the Cisco IOS device forwards (for example, transit DHCP traffic) will not trigger this vulnerability, but the packets forwarded to the DHCP relay agent will trigger the vulnerability.       Cisco IOS devices that are configured as a DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) server for IP version 6 (IPv6) are not affected by this vulnerability.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCug31561](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug31561) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only). This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5475.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.  The Cisco IOS Software Checker allows customers to search for Cisco Security Advisories that address specific Cisco IOS Software releases.
