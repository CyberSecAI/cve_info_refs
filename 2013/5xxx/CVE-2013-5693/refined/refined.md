- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data in the "model" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/index.php/admin/editor" URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the browser within the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:**  A specially crafted URL with malicious JavaScript code injected into the "model" parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking the malicious link.
