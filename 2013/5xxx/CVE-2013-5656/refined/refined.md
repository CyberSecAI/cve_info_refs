Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Stack-based buffer overflow. Specifically, it's a SEH (Structured Exception Handling) buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application, FuzeZip v1.0.0.131625, does not properly handle the size of the input when processing ZIP files, allowing for a buffer overflow. The overflow occurs when the application attempts to write data into a buffer that is smaller than the data being written.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the SEH record on the stack.
- This allows the attacker to redirect the execution flow to attacker-controlled code, resulting in arbitrary code execution.
- The attacker can gain full control of the system where the vulnerable application is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malformed ZIP file. The attacker crafts a specially designed ZIP file that triggers the buffer overflow when processed by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed ZIP file to the user of the vulnerable software. This could be achieved through various methods such as email attachments, malicious websites, or file sharing.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the SEH structure and how to overwrite it to redirect execution.
- No special privileges are needed for a local user to execute this exploit
- The attacker must entice the user to open the malicious ZIP file with the vulnerable FuzeZip application.

**Additional Details**
- The provided exploit code utilizes a crafted payload containing 'venetian' (likely padding), the next SEH pointer and the SEH handler which will jump to the shellcode.
- Shellcode is executed to gain control of the system.
- The exploit was tested on Windows 2003 Server Standard SP2.
