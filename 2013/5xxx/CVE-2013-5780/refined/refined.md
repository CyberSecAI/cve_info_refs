Guideline 4: For relevant content, extract:
   - Root cause of vulnerability
   - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
   - Impact of exploitation
   - Attack vectors
   - Required attacker capabilities/position
```

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a key data leak via the `toString()` methods within the Libraries component of Java SE, JRockit, and Java SE Embedded. These methods unintentionally included sensitive key data in their output, leading to potential information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the inclusion of sensitive data within the string representation of cryptographic keys when the `toString()` method is called.
- Insufficient checks and sanitization of the output of `toString()` methods on cryptographic key objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive cryptographic key material if an application logs or otherwise reveals the output of the `toString()` method.
-  The vulnerability could be triggered both in client and server deployments.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets.
-  The vulnerability can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified component (Libraries) without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or applets, such as through a web service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trigger the `toString()` method on the affected cryptographic key objects. This could be through the execution of a malicious Java applet, a Java Web Start application, or by interacting with a vulnerable application that calls those methods.
- An attacker could also achieve this by supplying data to APIs in the specified component (Libraries) without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or applets, such as through a web service.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple products such as Java SE, JRockit, and Java SE Embedded.
- The severity of the vulnerability depends on the context where the key data is leaked.
- Patches are available to fix this vulnerability.
- Red Hat also issued a security advisory to fix this vulnerability in their products.
