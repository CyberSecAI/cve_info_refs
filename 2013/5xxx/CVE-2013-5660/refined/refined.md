Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2013-5660

**Vulnerability:** SEH (Structured Exception Handler) buffer overflow

**Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in WinArchiver v3.2 due to improper handling of a specially crafted ZIP archive. This leads to overwriting the SEH, allowing for control of program execution flow.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **SEH Overflow:** The application does not properly validate the size or content of the data when processing ZIP archives, leading to an exploitable buffer overflow in the Structured Exception Handler (SEH).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious ZIP File:** The attacker must craft a malicious ZIP file that, when opened using WinArchiver v3.2 and extracted, will trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to open the specially crafted ZIP file using WinArchiver and click the extract button to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Crafted Payload:** The attacker must be able to create a specifically crafted malicious ZIP file to achieve code execution.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was reported by RealPentesting.
* The vendor was contacted twice but did not respond.
* The vulnerability is not fixed in the version 3.2.
* The SEH overwrite is achieved with the value 0x00410041.
