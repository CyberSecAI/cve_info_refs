Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5045:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `IESetProtectedModeRegKeyOnly` function of `ieframe.dll`. This function doesn't properly validate permissions when creating registry keys, allowing a low-integrity process, such as Internet Explorer's sandbox, to influence which registry keys are modified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Permission Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper permission checks within the `IESetProtectedModeRegKeyOnly` function. This allows a low-integrity process to potentially write to registry keys that should be protected.
- **Registry Symlink Abuse:** The exploit leverages registry symlinks, which are essentially pointers in the registry, to redirect the registry modifications to a location where they can bypass the Enhanced Protected Mode.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** By manipulating the registry, the attacker elevates the integrity level of their code execution from Low to Medium.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Sandbox Escape:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the Internet Explorer sandbox (Enhanced Protected Mode).
- **Medium Integrity Code Execution:** Once the sandbox is bypassed, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with medium integrity. This grants the attacker the same user rights as the current user, allowing them to perform actions such as installing programs, viewing/modifying data, and creating user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious website containing specially crafted content that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Compromised Websites:** Compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content can also be used to deliver the exploit.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious website, for example, through a link in an email or instant message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Code Execution in Low Integrity IE Process:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a low-integrity Internet Explorer process. This can be achieved using a separate exploit for remote code execution vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- **Knowledge of Registry Structure:** The attacker must know the specific registry keys and symlink manipulation techniques to successfully bypass the protected mode.
- **Ability to Host Content:** The attacker needs the ability to host malicious web content or have access to compromised websites.
