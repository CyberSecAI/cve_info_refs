```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The time it takes to compute password hashes using some encoders in Symfony increases significantly with the length of the password. An attacker could repeatedly submit login forms with very long passwords, forcing the server to perform expensive computations, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Lack of a maximum password length in the FOSUserBundle login form.
    - Vulnerable password encoders which have computation time that increases with password length
- Impact of exploitation: Denial-of-service (DoS). By submitting many requests with extremely long passwords, an attacker could exhaust server resources, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
- Attack vectors: Submitting login forms with extremely long passwords.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs the ability to submit login forms.
