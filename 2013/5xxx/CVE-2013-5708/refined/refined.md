The provided content is a vulnerability note (VU#960908) from CERT/CC, which details multiple vulnerabilities found in Coursemill Learning Management System versions 6.6 and 6.8. While the main note doesn't directly reference CVE-2013-5708, it lists several CVEs including CVE-2013-3599, CVE-2013-3600, CVE-2013-3601, CVE-2013-3602, CVE-2013-3603, CVE-2013-3604 and CVE-2013-3605. Therefore, this content is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2013-5708.

Here is a summary of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CVE-2013-3599 (CWE-472):** External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter. The user role is returned as a parameter to the client, allowing privilege escalation even without authentication (especially in Coursemill 6.6). Partially fixed in 6.8.
*   **CVE-2013-3600 (CWE-472):**  External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter. The `userid` parameter is exploitable in the "Edit Profile" function, allowing access to other users' information, including privileged users (in Coursemill 6.6). Remediation status in 6.8 is unknown.
*   **CVE-2013-3601 (CWE-250):** Execution with Unnecessary Privileges. Non-administrative users could execute admin-only functions through the `op` parameter in JSP calls in Coursemill 6.6. This has been fixed in Coursemill 6.8
*   **CVE-2013-3602 (CWE-89):** SQL Injection. The `docID` parameter in `admindocumentworker.jsp` is directly passed to SQL queries in Coursemill 6.6, allowing SQL injection. This has been fixed in Coursemill 6.8.
*  **CVE-2013-3603 (CWE-79):** Cross-site Scripting (XSS). User-provided URLs are reflected back to the browser in error messages without proper sanitization in Coursemill 6.6 and partially in 6.8. 6.8 attempts to remove event attributes starting with "on" but is bypassable by inserting null bytes or exploiting browsers that don't require closing brackets.
*   **CVE-2013-3604 (CWE-79):** Stored XSS. Stored XSS is possible in multiple input fields in Coursemill 6.6 and 6.8. 6.8 filters closing quotes but not other inputs such as %22.
*   **CVE-2013-3605 (CWE-352):** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Coursemill 6.6 relies on cookie values for authentication, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Coursemill 6.8 uses predictable CSRF tokens (timestamps of the user).

**Impact:**

*   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
*   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
*   Privilege escalation, potentially leading to information leakage and other unauthorized actions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Manipulating web parameters (e.g., `userrole`, `userid`, `op`, `docID`)
*   Crafting URLs with malicious JavaScript for XSS
*   Exploiting predictable CSRF tokens
*   SQL Injection using docID parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the Coursemill server
*   For XSS, ability to trick users into clicking crafted URLs
*   For SQLi, understanding of the underlying database structure/queries
*   For CSRF, the attacker needs to trick the authenticated user to submit requests
