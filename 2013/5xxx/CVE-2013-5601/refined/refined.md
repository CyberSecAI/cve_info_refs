  "CVE-2013-5601": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey. The worst of which may allow user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.  A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified impact. It was found that the Firefox JavaScript engine incorrectly allocated memory for certain functions. An attacker could combine this flaw with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox. A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) files. An attacker could combine this flaw with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.  Security researcher Nils used the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to discover missing strong references in browsing engine leading to use-after-frees. This can lead to a potentially exploitable crash. ASAN use-after free in GC allocation in nsEventListenerManager::SetEventHandler.",
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists due to missing strong references when updating the offline cache during state change events and a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine when using workers with direct proxies, leading to a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to missing strong references.",
      "Memory corruption due to incorrect memory allocation in JavaScript engine"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service condition.  Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified impact.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "Enticing a user to view a specially crafted web page or email.",
       "Exploitation through vulnerabilities combined with the JavaScript engine issue or XSLT handling flaw."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious webpage or email that would trigger the use-after-free vulnerability, memory corruption or the javascript flaw.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered during state change events while updating the offline cache, also triggered with the JavaScript engine when using workers with direct proxies and is exposed through crafted web content, emails or RSS feeds. The issue was identified using the Address Sanitizer tool during fuzzing."
