Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the WebSphere eXtreme Scale monitoring console.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The monitoring console does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to:
  - Stealing session cookies
  - Defacing the monitoring console
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker would need to inject malicious code into a field or parameter of the web application that is not properly sanitized.
- The attack requires a user to interact with the crafted link or page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application. The attack complexity is Medium (AC:M), likely because it requires some specific knowledge of the application's input validation weaknesses.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated, as a user, in order to exploit this vulnerability (Au:S).

**Additional Information:**
- The provided document also mentions two other vulnerabilities in the same product: CVE-2013-5393 (logoff processing weakness) and CVE-2013-5394 (phishing attack).
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in WebSphere eXtreme Scale V7.1.1 Fix Pack 1, V8.5 Fix Pack 3, and V8.6 Fix Pack 3.
- The CVSS vector for this vulnerability is (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N), which translates to:
    - Attack Vector: Network
    - Attack Complexity: Medium
    - Authentication: Single
    - Confidentiality Impact: None
    - Integrity Impact: Partial
    - Availability Impact: None
- The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 3.5.
