As there is no POC we can only test that the qdigidoc client is still opening ddoc files after updating.  How to test: 1. Install qdigidoc. 2. Open file in [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=11100#c1) and check that the signature is valid. 3. Update libdigidoc. 4. Repeat second step.  Suggested advisory: ========================  Updated libdigidoc packages fix security vulnerability:  Fixed one critical bug in the DDOC parsing routines. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted DDOC file, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the privileges of the victim.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1002299#c0)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-28 20:34:33 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that ID-software 3.7.2 (libdigidoc):  "Fixed one critical bug in the DDOC parsing routines. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted DDOC file, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files on the system with the privileges of the victim."  The patch is in svn (not the repository from code.google.com/p/esteid, but from svn.eesti.ee) [3] (r98).  This patch was backported for Mageia [4] and looks applicable to what we ship in Fedora (although we have a much older version).  The patch from Mageia (or upstream) won't apply without changes, however, as it's adding a new error code.  Judging from the patch, it's just making sure that the file name doesn't include '/' or '\\' (so no paths in the filename).   [1] <http://www.id.ee/?lang=en&id=34283#3_7_2> [2] <https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11100> [3] <https://svn.eesti.ee/projektid/idkaart_public/> [4] <http://svnweb.mageia.org/packages/updates/3/libdigidoc/current/SOURCES/libdigidoc-3.6.0.0-security-fix-DataFile-name-tag.patch?revision=472660&view=markup>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1002299#c1)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-28 20:37:11 UTC  ```  Created libdigidoc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1002302](show_bug.cgi?id=1002302 "CLOSED ERRATA - libdigidoc: arbitrary file overwrite flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1002299#c2)  Vincent Danen    2013-08-29 04:55:55 UTC  ``` This issue was assigned the name CVE-2013-5648:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/08/29/2>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1002299#c3)  Fedora Update System    2014-11-18 12:20:59 UTC  ``` libdigidoc-3.9.1.1191-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
