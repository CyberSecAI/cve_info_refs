Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper file type validation in the `upload-images.php` file of the WordPress Complete Gallery Manager plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin allows remote attackers to upload files with multiple extensions via a POST request. This bypasses intended file upload restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the uploaded files on the server.
  - **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading malicious files (e.g., PHP webshells), attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
  - **Local File Inclusion:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized path or file access via local file inclusion.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
  - **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a POST request to `upload-images.php` containing the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **No User Interaction Required:** The attack does not require any user interaction.
  - **No Privilege User Account Required:**  The attacker does not need any specific privileges or an application user account to exploit the vulnerability.
  - **Remote Access:**  The attacker needs remote access to the vulnerable WordPress instance.

**Technical Details:**
  - The vulnerable file is `upload-images.php` located in `/plugins/complete-gallery-manager/frames/`.
  - The exploit uses a `curl` command to send a POST request with the malicious file using the `qqfile` parameter.
  - The uploaded file can be accessed through the `/wp-content/` directory.

This vulnerability allows for complete compromise of the affected web server if exploited successfully.
