Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5960:

**Verification:**
The content directly mentions issue #359, which is listed in the release notes as fixed. Issue #359 is titled "CodecTest unit tests never test with a populated char array.". Therefore, this content is relevant to the CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that the `Codec` implementations within ESAPI (OWASP Enterprise Security API) were not correctly handling "immune" characters during encoding. Specifically, if a character was designated as "immune" (meaning it should not be encoded), the codec implementations were still encoding it, contrary to expectations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Immunity Handling:** The codecs failed to respect the defined immunity lists when encoding, which can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful results when the encoded data is later used in different contexts, such as HTML or JavaScript.
- **Lack of Comprehensive Testing:** The unit tests were not testing the codecs with a populated char array, which masked this issue. This highlights a vulnerability in testing practices of the library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Integrity Issues:** The encoding process was not behaving as intended, altering the original input and corrupting the data. For example, if a developer wanted to pass through a percent sign, they would expect it to remain a percent sign. Instead it might be encoded.
- **Potential for Bypass:** Applications relying on the "immunity" feature to prevent double encoding or to allow certain characters to pass through might be vulnerable to unexpected behavior if the encoded data is used downstream. The issue is in a critical security component for data handling.
- **Unexpected Output:** Specific examples in the issue description include the canonicalization of '%Device%' being converted to 'Ãžvice%'.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker might provide specially crafted input containing characters that are intended to be treated as immune. Due to the faulty encoding, the output could differ from what was expected and potentially allow a vulnerability in another system.
- **Indirect Exploitation:** An attacker might not directly exploit this vulnerability in the ESAPI library, but it could be exploited in other downstream systems that process the output of the library incorrectly due to a misunderstanding of the encoded output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** An attacker needs to be aware that ESAPI's codec implementations have this issue.
- **Control over Input:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input that is being encoded using ESAPI's codecs.
- **Downstream impact:** The impact of the exploitation can be in downstream applications that rely on the encoded output of the vulnerable version of ESAPI.

**Additional Details (from the provided content):**

* The issue was discovered by a contributor named Jeremiah Stacey.
*  A test case that reproduces the issue is included in the issue description which can be used to verify the fix.

In summary, CVE-2013-5960 is due to a flaw in how the ESAPI library's codec implementations handled "immune" characters, leading to incorrect encoding. The impact could vary from data corruption to potential bypass of other security controls. The fix for this vulnerability is included in the release notes, specifically linked to issue #359.
