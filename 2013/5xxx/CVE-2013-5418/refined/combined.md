To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.
