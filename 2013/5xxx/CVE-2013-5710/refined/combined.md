Debian Security Advisory DSA-2769-1                security@debian.org

Package        : kfreebsd-9
Vulnerability  : privilege escalation/denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2013-5691 CVE-2013-5710

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeBSD kernel that may
lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-5691

    Loganaden Velvindron and Gleb Smirnoff discovered that the SIOCSIFADDR,
    SIOCSIFBRDADDR, SIOCSIFDSTADDR and SIOCSIFNETMASK ioctl requests do not
    perform input validation or verify the caller's credentials.
    Unprivileged user with the ability to run arbitrary code can cause any
    network interface in the system to perform the link layer actions
    associated with the above ioctl requests or trigger a kernel panic by
    passing a specially crafted address structure which causes a network
    interface driver to dereference an invalid pointer.

CVE-2013-5710

    Konstantin Belousov discovered that the nullfs(5) implementation of the
    VOP_LINK(9) VFS operation does not check whether the source and target of
    the link are both in the same nullfs instance. It is therefore possible to
    create a hardlink from a location in one nullfs instance to a file in
    another, as long as the underlying (source) filesystem is the same. If
    multiple nullfs views into the same filesystem are mounted in different
    locations, a user may gain write access to files which are nominally on
    a read-only filesystem.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.

FreeBSD-SA-13:13.nullfs Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Cross-mount links between nullfs(5) mounts
Category: core
Module: nullfs
Announced: 2013-09-10
Credits: Konstantin Belousov
Affects: All supported versions of FreeBSD.
Corrected: 2013-09-10 10:07:21 UTC (stable/9, 9.2-STABLE)
2013-09-10 10:08:20 UTC (releng/9.2, 9.2-RC1-p2)

2013-09-10 10:13:14 UTC (releng/8.3, 8.3-RELEASE-p11)
CVE Name: CVE-2013-5710
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The nullfs(5) filesystem allows all or a part of an already mounted
filesystem to be made available in a different part of the global
filesystem namespace. It is commonly used to make a set of files
available to multiple chroot(2) or jail(2) environments without
replicating the files in each environment. A common idiom, described
in the FreeBSD Handbook, is to mount one subtree of a filesystem
read-only within a jail's filesystem namespace, and mount a different
subtree of the same filesystem read-write.
II. Problem Description
The nullfs(5) implementation of the VOP\_LINK(9) VFS operation does not
check whether the source and target of the link are both in the same
nullfs instance. It is therefore possible to create a hardlink from a
location in one nullfs instance to a file in another, as long as the
underlying (source) filesystem is the same.
III. Impact
If multiple nullfs views into the same filesystem are mounted in
different locations, a user with read access to one of these views and
write access to another will be able to create a hard link from the
latter to a file in the former, even though they are, from the user's
perspective, different filesystems. The user may thereby gain write
access to files which are nominally on a read-only filesystem.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems which do not use the nullfs(5)
filesystem, or do not null-mount different subtrees of the same source
filesystem with different permissions, are not vulnerable.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:13/nullfs.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:13/nullfs.patch.asc
# gpg --verify nullfs.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/8/ r255445
releng/8.3/ r255446
releng/8.4/ r255447
stable/9/ r255443
releng/9.1/ r255448
releng/9.2/ r255444
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base
Or visit the following URL, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Log Message: | ``` Fix the length calculation for the final block of a sendfile(2) transmission which could be tricked into rounding up to the nearest page size, leaking up to a page of kernel memory.  [13:11]  In IPv6 and NetATM, stop SIOCSIFADDR, SIOCSIFBRDADDR, SIOCSIFDSTADDR and SIOCSIFNETMASK at the socket layer rather than pass them on to the link layer without validation or credential checks.  [SA-13:12]  Prevent cross-mount hardlinks between different nullfs mounts of the same underlying filesystem.  [SA-13:13]  Security:	CVE-2013-5666 Security:	FreeBSD-SA-13:11.sendfile Security:	CVE-2013-5691 Security:	FreeBSD-SA-13:12.ifioctl Security:	CVE-2013-5710 Security:	FreeBSD-SA-13:13.nullfs Approved by:	re   ``` |
