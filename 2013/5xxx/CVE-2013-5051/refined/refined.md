Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2013-5051:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability. Specifically, the improper access to objects in memory could lead to memory corruption

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means an attacker could gain the same user rights as the logged-in user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website. An attacker would need to host a malicious website and convince the user to view it with Internet Explorer.
- Attackers could also leverage compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content/ads to deliver the malicious content.
- The attacker would need to convince the user to take some action (e.g., click a link in an email or instant message, or open a malicious attachment).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to host a webpage containing the exploit.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to browse to the malicious webpage using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Additional details:**
- The document lists the specific versions of Internet Explorer affected by this vulnerability and the corresponding operating systems.
- It also provides information about mitigations (e.g., Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers, using EMET).
- The document includes workarounds, such as configuring Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting, which can reduce the attack surface.

- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the security bulletin's release.
- The document also acknowledges Atte Kettunen of OUSPG for reporting the vulnerability.
