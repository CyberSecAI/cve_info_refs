{
  "CVE-2013-5772": {
    "root_cause": "The Java Heap Analysis Tool (jhat) failed to properly escape all data added into the HTML pages it generated.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient HTML escaping in jhat"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted content in the memory of a Java program analyzed using jhat could possibly be used to conduct Cross-Site Scripting attacks against users viewing jhat generated pages.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By tricking a user into analyzing a crafted Java heap dump with jhat."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "An attacker needs to control the data within a Java heap dump that is analyzed by the jhat tool"
    ],
    "more_info": "The vulnerability is caused by the way jhat creates HTML pages for displaying analysis results.  User-controlled data included in the heap is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script via a crafted heap dump which will execute in a user's browser."
  },
   "CVE-2013-5797": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient escaping of user-controlled input when generating Javascript code to set the browser window title in javadoc generated HTML pages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient Javascript string escaping"
    ],
    "impact": "A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack can be conducted. A specially crafted input to javadoc can break out of the JS string and execute arbitrary javascript within the context of the domain that hosts the generated API documentation.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By injecting a crafted string into the Java documentation that is processed by javadoc."
     ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "An attacker needs to control the source code being documented by javadoc, and have the generated documentation hosted on a domain not controlled by the author of the source code (the attacker)."
    ],
        "more_info": "The javadoc tool generates JavaScript code to set the browser window title based on user provided data.  If that data contains unescaped quotes or `</script>` tags, it breaks out of the intended Javascript context, allowing an attacker to execute code."
