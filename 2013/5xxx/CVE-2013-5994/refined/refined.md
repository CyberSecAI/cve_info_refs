Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the `ParentPage` parameter in the `LC_Page_Mypage_DeliveryAddr.php` file. Specifically, the application was using `$_POST['ParentPage']` to generate a redirect URL, but not verifying if the provided value was one of the allowed pages. This could lead to the exposure of the server's file path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The application uses user-supplied data (`$_POST['ParentPage']`) to construct a URL, and if this is not a valid value, then the application would return the full server path.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code fails to properly validate the `ParentPage` parameter against a list of allowed values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially obtain the absolute path of the product on the server by sending a specially crafted request containing an arbitrary `ParentPage` value. This information could be used to further map out the application structure for other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint, including an arbitrary value in the `ParentPage` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable EC-CUBE instance. No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** EC-CUBE versions 2.11.2 through 2.13.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in changeset 23278, which introduces a check to validate the `ParentPage` parameter against a predefined list of allowed values (`DELIV_URLPATH`, `MYPAGE_DELIVADDR_URLPATH`, `MULTIPLE_URLPATH`). The fix also modifies the redirection logic to use the validated `ParentPage`.
