- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Malicious third-party applications that wrote specific values to the `/dev/random` device could force the CPU to enter an infinite loop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of writes to the `/dev/random` device, allowing malicious input to cause an infinite loop.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Applications can cause a system hang (Denial of Service).
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious local application writing to `/dev/random`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute a malicious local application.
