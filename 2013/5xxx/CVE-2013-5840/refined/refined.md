Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5840:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2013-5840 lies in the `getDeclaringClass()` method within OpenJDK. It was discovered that this method implementation did not perform class loader package access checks, which could potentially allow an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. This is related to an information leak, where internal class details become accessible.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient package access checks:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper checks on class loader package access within the `getDeclaringClass()` method.
*   **Information Leak:** The vulnerability allows an information leak by making internal class information available, potentially revealing sensitive details about the application's internals.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox bypass:** The main impact is the potential bypass of Java sandbox restrictions. Untrusted Java applications or applets could gain access to resources or perform actions that they are not normally authorized to.
*   **Information disclosure:** A compromised applet could potentially gain access to sensitive information about the application's classes by calling the vulnerable method.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through untrusted Java applets or applications.
*   **Web-based attacks:** Attackers can host malicious Java applets on a website and trick users into running them in their web browsers, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code with user privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Untrusted Java Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute untrusted Java code (applet or application).
*   **Target Environment:** The target needs to be running a vulnerable version of the Java Runtime Environment, specifically one that uses the flawed `getDeclaringClass()` method.

The provided content also indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in the following versions:

*   Oracle Java SE 7u45 and 6u65
*   IcedTea7 2.4.3
*   IcedTea6 1.11.14 and 1.12.7

Additionally, it mentions that this vulnerability affects a variety of Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions.
