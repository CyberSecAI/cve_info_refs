  "CVE-2013-5763": {
    "description": "The vulnerability exists in the Oracle Outside In libraries, specifically within the Outside In Maintenance component. This vulnerability could lead to partial denial-of-service.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Oracle Outside In Technology 8.4.0",
      "Oracle Outside In Technology 8.4.1",
      "Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 SP3",
      "Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 SP2",
       "Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 SP3",
      "Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 CU2",
      "Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 CU3"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the way the Oracle Outside In libraries process specially crafted files.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote Code Execution (Microsoft Exchange Server)",
      "Partial Denial-of-Service (Oracle Outside In Technology)"
    ],
    "impact": "In Microsoft Exchange Server, successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution within the security context of the LocalService account. The LocalService account has minimal privileges. In Oracle Outside In Technology, exploitation could lead to partial denial of service.  In Exchange Server 2013, it can cause the affected server to become unresponsive.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file (e.g., via email).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted file to a user on the affected system.  For Exchange Server, the user must either preview the email using Outlook Web Access (OWA) or the email must be processed by the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) service.",
	"additional_notes": "The vulnerability is related to the WebReady Document Viewing and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) features in Microsoft Exchange Server. The Oracle Outside In library is used by these features.  The CVSS score for Outside In Technology is increased if the hosting software passes network data to Outside In code."
