Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-5513:

**Vulnerability:** DNS Inspection Denial of Service

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper processing of unsupported DNS over TCP packets by the DNS inspection engine in Cisco ASA Software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The DNS Application Layer Protocol Inspection (ALPI) engine is not correctly handling crafted DNS messages over TCP.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause a reload of the affected device, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This would interrupt network services and connectivity through the affected device.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send crafted DNS messages over TCP through an affected Cisco ASA device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DNS packets via TCP to the targeted device.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    *   The attacker must target traffic that is inspected by the DNS ALPI engine.
*   **Affected Configurations:** Cisco ASA Software is affected if the DNS Application Layer Protocol Inspection (ALPI) engine is configured to inspect DNS packets over TCP.
*   **Affected Products:** Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA 5500-X Next Generation Firewall, Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, and Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall.
*   **Traffic Type:** Both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic can trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Firewall Modes:** The vulnerability is present in both routed and transparent firewall modes, as well as single and multiple context mode.
*   **Workaround:** Ensure only UDP traffic is sent to the DNS ALPI engine for inspection, effectively disabling DNS inspection over TCP which is not supported by Cisco ASA anyway.
*   **Fix:** Upgrade to a fixed version of Cisco ASA Software (see table in advisory).
