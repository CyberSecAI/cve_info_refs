  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2013-5603",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free in `nsContentUtils::ContentIsHostIncludingDescendantOf`. This is caused by the `HTMLTemplateElement` not properly calling `SetHost(nullptr)` on its mContent member when unlinked, which can lead to mContent being nulled out without calling `SetHost` first.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by interacting with HTML document templates.",
      "A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page or email (though less likely for Thunderbird and Seamonkey due to disabled scripting in emails)."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTML document templates in a way that causes the vulnerable code to be executed when the template is unlinked.",
        "User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability."
