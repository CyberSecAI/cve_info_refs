##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware ESXi and ESX contain a vulnerability in hostd-vmdb.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must intercept and
modify the management traffic. Exploitation of the issue may lead
to a Denial of Service of the hostd-vmdb service.

To reduce the likelihood of exploitation, vSphere components
should be deployed on an isolated management network.

VMware would like to thank Alex Chapman of Context Information
Security for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2013-5970 to this issue.

Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
available.

##### b. VMware vSphere Web Client Server Session Fixation Vulnerability

The VMware vSphere Web Client Server contains a vulnerability in
the handling of session IDs. To exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker must know a valid session ID of an authenticated user.
Exploitation of the issue may lead to Elevation of Privilege.

To reduce the likelihood of exploitation, vSphere components
should be deployed on an isolated management network.

VMware would like to thank Alexey Tyurin of DSecRG for reporting
this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2013-5971 to this issue.
