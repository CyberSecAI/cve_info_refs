- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The VMware vSphere Web Client Server has a vulnerability in how it handles session IDs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Session fixation vulnerability. The server does not properly validate or invalidate session IDs, which allows an attacker to potentially hijack a valid user session.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to Elevation of Privilege, where an attacker can perform actions as another user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires an attacker to know a valid session ID of an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to intercept or otherwise obtain a valid session ID of an authenticated user to exploit the vulnerability. They would likely need to be on the same network, or have some other way to capture or obtain the session ID.
