Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5318:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in Ginkgo CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `index.php?rang=` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   Read sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Modify or delete database records.
    *   Potentially gain full control of the web application by further exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `rang` parameter of a GET request to `index.php`.
*   The example payload given is: `http://server/index.php?rang=5'/**/div/**/0/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,4,5-- -`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Ginkgo CMS application. This means they could be remote (outside of the organization's network) or local (within the organization).
*   Basic understanding of SQL injection is required to craft the malicious queries.
