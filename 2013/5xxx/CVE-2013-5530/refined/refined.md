Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5530:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient input validation in the web framework of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). Specifically, this involves the TCP Dump functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Improper Input Validation (CWE-20): The system does not adequately validate user-supplied input, allowing for command injection.
*   Arbitrary Command Execution: Due to the lack of input validation, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected system with root privileges.
*   This could lead to full system compromise, including data breaches, system instability, or further attacks within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote attack over the default management TCP port 443.
*   The attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attack involves crafting a malicious HTTP request with encoded commands in a vulnerable parameter of the TCP Dump functionality

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the Cisco ISE system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests, and they might need to use a proxy to manipulate the request.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh81511.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS Base Score of 9.0 and a Temporal Score of 7.4, indicating high severity and potential for exploitation.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Jan Kadijk from Warpnet and later by Stephen Hosom.
*   The vulnerability is tracked under CERT Vulnerability Note VU#952422.
