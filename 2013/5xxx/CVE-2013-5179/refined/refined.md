- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LaunchServices interface for launching an application allowed sandboxed apps to specify the list of arguments passed to the new process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Sandboxed applications could specify arguments, bypassing the sandbox.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A compromised sandboxed application could bypass the sandbox.
- **Attack vectors:** A compromised sandboxed application can exploit the LaunchServices interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to compromise a sandboxed application.
