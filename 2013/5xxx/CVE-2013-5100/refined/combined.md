# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2013-001: Several vulnerabilities in third party extensions

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the following third-party TYPO3 extensions: news, onetimeaccount, phpunit, div2007, t3mootools, t3jquery, oneclicklogin

**Release Date:** January 11, 2013

**Please read first:** This Collective Security Bulletin (CSB) is a listing of vulnerable extensions with neither significant download numbers, nor other special importance amongst the TYPO3 Community. The intention of CSBs is to reduce the workload of the TYPO3 Security Team and of the maintainers of extensions with vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities in TYPO3 core or important extensions will still get the well-known single Security Bulletin each.

Please read our [buzz blog post](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/collective-security-bulletins-csb-the-reason-for/), which has a detailed explanation on CSBs.

All vulnerabilities affect third-party extensions. These extensions are not part of the TYPO3 default installation
