Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Apple OS X processes text input in the dialog box that appears when recovering from sleep mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect processing of text input during the wake-from-sleep authentication process.
- Specifically, the text entered is not properly directed to the local host but is instead routed to a remotely connected host under specific circumstances.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When Apple Remote Desktop is used in full-screen mode and a remote connection is active when the system enters sleep mode, any text entered in the authentication dialog upon waking is sent to the remote host.
- This could potentially lead to the execution of commands on the remote host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through physical access to a machine that is running OS X and has an active Apple Remote Desktop connection in full-screen mode prior to entering sleep mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable machine.
- The machine must have an active Apple Remote Desktop connection in full-screen mode before it enters sleep mode.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OS X versions prior to 10.9 and Apple Remote Desktop versions prior to 3.7.
- The vulnerability was reported by Masaki Katayama of Cyber Risks Laboratory Naviplus CO,Ltd.
