- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A symbolic link in a backup would be restored, allowing subsequent operations during the restore to write to the rest of the filesystem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of symbolic links during backup restore process. Specifically, the restore process failed to check for symbolic links allowing the restore process to write anywhere on the file system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A maliciously crafted backup could alter the filesystem, potentially leading to arbitrary file modification or system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious attacker would need to create a crafted backup with a symbolic link within it. This could be achieved by malware or a malicious user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to create and introduce a malicious crafted backup onto the targeted device. The ability to conduct a backup on a target device.
