- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Third-party applications using the `#!` syntax to run a script were sandboxed based on the script interpreter's identity, not the script itself. If the interpreter lacked a defined sandbox, the application would run unsandboxed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect sandboxing based on the script interpreter's identity instead of the script's.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unsandboxed execution of third-party applications, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Executing a crafted script with a specific `#!` shebang, exploiting the sandboxing logic to bypass sandbox restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to have the user execute a script with the vulnerable shebang. The attacker would need to get a user to install and run such an application.
