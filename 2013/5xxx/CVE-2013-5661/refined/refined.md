  "CVE-2013-5661": {
    "Description": "Cache Poisoning issue exists in DNS Response Rate Limiting.",
    "Root cause": "The use of DNS response rate limiting (RRL) techniques to prevent DNS amplification DDoS attacks can inadvertently make DNS cache poisoning attacks easier.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "DNS Response Rate Limiting (RRL) implementation",
       "Cache poisoning"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to poison the DNS cache of a resolver, leading to redirection of users to malicious servers.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a large amount of DNS requests with spoofed source IPs to an authoritative DNS server which has RRL enabled. The attacker then needs to send spoofed DNS responses to the targeted resolver before the legitimate response is received. The attacker also needs to be able to guess correct transaction ID and source port number.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability arises from the interaction between RRL's 'slip' parameter and cache poisoning. When a server employs RRL with a default 'slip' value of 2, it responds to some queries while dropping others. This creates a window of opportunity for attackers to flood resolvers with spoofed responses. The default 'slip' value of 2 means that only half of all requests are answered, while the value 1 causes the name server to send a response to all requests. Setting slip=1 reduces the risk of cache poisoning but also reduces the effectiveness of RRL as a DDoS protection mechanism.  Attackers can send a large number of DNS requests with spoofed source IP addresses of the resolver, which triggers RRL, causing legitimate requests from resolver to be dropped. Attackers then send spoofed replies to the resolver and try to guess correct transaction ID and source port without having to race against legitimate replies. It is important to note that Red Hat does not plan to change the default value of the slip parameter as RRL upstream does not believe that the benefits of slip=1 outweigh its drawbacks."
