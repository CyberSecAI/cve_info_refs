| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software Queue Wedge Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20130925-wedge  First Published: 2013 September 25 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCub67465](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub67465)     CVE-2013-5477     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2013-5477     CWE-399       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-wedge/oval/cisco-sa-20130925-wedge_400.xml)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the T1/E1 driver queue implementation of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface wedge condition, which could lead to loss of connectivity, loss of routing protocol adjacency, and could result in a denial of service (DoS) scenario.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices running affected Cisco IOS Software versions configured with T1/E1 interface module signaling are vulnerable.   A device is vulnerable if all the following criteria are met:   + An interface controller configured for T1/E1 channel group is using the affected High-Level Data Link Control 32 (HDLC32) driver.   + T1/E1 controller clock source is configured for **line** or **internal**   **Note:** The affected HDLC32 driver is only used on VWIC2 interface cards for Cisco 1900, 2900 and 3900 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISR).      To determine whether a Cisco IOS device is configured with T1/E1 signaling on a controller using HDLC32 driver, issue the **show controllers** command.       The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the interface Serial0/0/0, configured for T1 signaling is using an HDLC32 driver as indicated by the “Hardware is HDLC32” output:     ```   Router#show controllers Serial0/0/0:0Interface Serial0/0/0:0Hardware is HDLC32< output truncated >         ``` **Note:** The vulnerability in the HDLC32 device driver on VWIC2 interface cards is not specific to Cisco High-Level Data Link Control network protocol encapsulation. Any supported encapsulation type on VWIC2 interface cards will result in the vulnerability.      To determine a clock source type configured on a T1/E1 interface on a Cisco IOS device, issue the **show controllers T1/E1** command.    The following example shows an E1 interface on a Cisco IOS device configured with line clock source:       ```   Router#show controllers e1 E1 0 is up.   Applique type is Channelized E1 - balanced !--- output truncatedFraming is CRC4, Line Code is HDB3, Clock Source is Line Primary. !--- output truncated   ```  To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR software is not affected by the vulnerability disclosed in this advisory.   Cisco IOS XE software is not affected by the vulnerability disclosed in this advisory.         No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability in the T1/E1 driver queue implementation of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface wedge condition, which could lead to loss of connectivity, loss of routing protocol adjacency, and could result in a denial of service (DoS) scenario.      The vulnerability is due to incorrect implementation of the T1/E1 driver queue. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending bursty traffic through the affected interface driver. Repeated exploitation could cause a DoS condition.      A device is vulnerable if it is configured with T1/E1 signaling on an interface that is using an HDLC32 driver.      An attacker with some knowledge of the affected infrastructure could exploit this vulnerability by sending a bursty profile of network packets through vulnerable devices. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to wedge the transmit queue of an egress interface.      Workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability are available.      Valid network traffic could trigger this vulnerability on devices that are considered vulnerable. An attacker could send an bursty profile of network packets egressing an interface with set conditions to exploit this vulnerability. Recovery from this interface queue wedge requires a reload of the device.      An interface queue wedge is a class of vulnerability where certain packets are received and queued by a Cisco IOS router or switch but, due to a processing error, are never removed from the queue.      For more information about queue wedges and a few detection mechanisms that may be used to identify a blocked interface on Cisco IOS Software (including a white paper describing how this condition can be detected using SNMP) see http://blogs.cisco.com/security/comments/cisco\_ios\_queue\_wedges\_explained/.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCub67465](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub67465) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5477.  Workarounds  * If a hardware upgrade is an option, a possible workaround would be to use VWIC3-T1/E1 or HWIC-T1/E1 interface cards instead of the VWIC2 interface card.   Alternatively, if the T1/E1 controller is configured for **clock source line**, and only a single channel-group is configured under controller, a possible workaround is to configure **clock source line independent**.       The following identification mechanism exist for this vulnerability.   Embedded Event Manager (EEM)  A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect an interface queue wedge that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the interfaces for Cisco IOS devices and detect when the interface input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations or reload the device to clear the input queue.      The Tcl script is available for download at the "Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community" at the following link: <https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337>      The Cisco Security blog "Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained" can be viewed at the following link: <http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to the latest available release where possible.
