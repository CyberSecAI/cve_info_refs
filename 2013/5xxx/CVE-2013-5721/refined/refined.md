Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2013-5721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the MQ (Message Queue) dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The MQ dissector has a flaw that can cause a crash. This is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful attack will cause Wireshark to crash, preventing further analysis of network traffic.
- This can disrupt network analysis and monitoring activities.
- Potentially allows an attacker to repeatedly crash Wireshark if they can repeatedly send the malformed packets.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malformed MQ packet can be injected onto the network to trigger the vulnerability while Wireshark is capturing traffic.
- An attacker can create a malicious packet trace file containing malformed MQ packets. Opening this file with Wireshark would then trigger the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to either inject network packets onto a network that a vulnerable Wireshark instance is monitoring, or to be able to convince a user to open a malicious packet capture file with a vulnerable version of Wireshark.
- No special permissions or privileges are noted to be required to exploit the vulnerability other than the ability to deliver the malformed data.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark versions 1.10.2 and 1.8.10.
- Red Hat and OpenSUSE also released patches to address this vulnerability in their respective distributions.
- This vulnerability is identified as `wnpa-sec-2013-58` in Wireshark's security advisories.
