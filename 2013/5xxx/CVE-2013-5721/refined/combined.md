[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0341)

## Topic

Updated wireshark packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer. It is used to capture and browse
the traffic running on a computer network.

Multiple flaws were found in Wireshark. If Wireshark read a malformed
packet off a network or opened a malicious dump file, it could crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark.
(CVE-2013-3559, CVE-2013-4083, CVE-2014-2281, CVE-2014-2299)

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2012-5595, CVE-2012-5598, CVE-2012-5599,
CVE-2012-5600, CVE-2012-6056, CVE-2012-6060, CVE-2012-6061, CVE-2012-6062,
CVE-2013-3557, CVE-2013-4081, CVE-2013-4927, CVE-2013-4931, CVE-2013-4932,
CVE-2013-4933, CVE-2013-4934, CVE-2013-4935, CVE-2013-5721, CVE-2013-7112)

All Wireshark users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running instances
of Wireshark must be restarted for the update to take effect.
