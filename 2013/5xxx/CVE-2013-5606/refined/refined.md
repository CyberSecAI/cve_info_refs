Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information extracted from the provided content, focusing on CVE-2013-5606:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Network Security Services (NSS) handles certificate validation when the `verifyLog` feature is enabled. Specifically, NSS does not reject certificates with incompatible key usage constraints during validation if the `verifyLog` is enabled.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** NSS fails to properly enforce key usage constraints when `verifyLog` is used, leading to the acceptance of invalid certificates.
*   The issue lies within the `CERT_VerifyCert` function within NSS, which was found to return `SECSuccess` even if the certificate was invalid

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Acceptance of Invalid Certificates:** An application using the NSS certificate validation API could accept an invalid certificate, thus bypassing key usage constraints.
*    The vulnerability may allow for a Man-in-the-middle attack against the CIM service (CVE-2014-8371).
*  The flaw, when exploited in conjunction with other OpenSSL flaws, could cause a denial of service.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting a specially crafted certificate with incompatible key usage constraints to an application using the NSS certificate validation API when it also enables logging.
* It may be possible for a MITM attacker to present a certificate with incompatible key usage while a client is connecting to a server.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, as they only need to present the malicious certificate during the validation process.
*   **Knowledge of `verifyLog` usage:** The attacker needs to be aware that the target application is using NSS with the `verifyLog` option enabled.
* **MITM:** In some scenarios, the attacker may need to be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack in order to present an invalid certificate.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability primarily affects applications that directly use the NSS library for certificate validation and use the `verifyLog` feature.
*   The vulnerability does *not* directly affect Firefox, but it could impact other software using the NSS library.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by upgrading to NSS 3.15.3 or a later version, where the certificate validation logic has been fixed to reject certificates with incompatible key usage constraints regardless of the presence or lack thereof of a verify log.
