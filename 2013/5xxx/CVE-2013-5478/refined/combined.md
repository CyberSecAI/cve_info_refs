| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  **Access Vector**  ---   Local (L) A vulnerability exploitable with only local access requires the attacker to have either physical access to the vulnerable system or a local (shell) account. Examples of locally exploitable vulnerabilities are peripheral attacks such as Firewire/USB DMA attacks, and local privilege escalations (e.g., sudo). Adjacent Network (A) A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. Examples of local networks include local IP subnet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, and local Ethernet segment.  Network (N) A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". An example of a network attack is an RPC buffer overflow.  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  **Access Complexity**  ---   High (H)  Specialized access conditions exist. For example: In most configurations, the attacking party must already have elevated privileges or spoof additional systems in addition to the attacking system (e.g., DNS hijacking). The attack depends on social engineering methods that would be easily detected by knowledgeable people. For example, the victim must perform several suspicious or atypical actions. The vulnerable configuration is seen very rarely in practice. If a race condition exists, the window is very narrow. Medium (M)  The access conditions are somewhat specialized; the following are examples: The attacking party is limited to a group of systems or users at some level of authorization, possibly untrusted. Some information must be gathered before a successful attack can be launched. The affected configuration is non-default, and is not commonly configured (e.g., a vulnerability present when a server performs user account authentication via a specific scheme, but not present for another authentication scheme). The attack requires a small amount of social engineering that might occasionally fool cautious users (e.g., phishing attacks that modify a web browser?s status bar to show a false link, having to be on someone?s ?buddy? list before sending an IM exploit).  Low (L)  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. The following are examples: The affected product typically requires access to a wide range of systems and users, possibly anonymous and untrusted (e.g., Internet-facing web or mail server). The affected configuration is default or ubiquitous. The attack can be performed manually and requires little skill or additional information gathering. The ?race condition? is a lazy one (i.e., it is technically a race but easily winnable).  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  **Authentication**  ---   Multiple (M) Exploiting the vulnerability requires that the attacker authenticate two or more times, even if the same credentials are used each time. An example is an attacker authenticating to an operating system in addition to providing credentials to access an application hosted on that system. Single (S) The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop session or web interface).  None (N) Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  **Confidentiality Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. Partial (P) There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. An example is a vulnerability that divulges only certain tables in a database.  Complete (C) There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed. The attacker is able to read all of the system's data (memory, files, etc.)  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  **Integrity Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the integrity of the system. Partial (P) Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. For example, system or application files may be overwritten or modified, but either the attacker has no control over which files are affected or the attacker can modify files within only a limited context or scope.  Complete (C) There is a total compromise of system integrity. There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire system being compromised. The attacker is able to modify any files on the target system.  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete  **Availability Impact**  ---   None (N) There is no impact to the availability of the system. Partial (P)There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. An example is a network-based flood attack that permits a limited number of successful connections to an Internet service.  Complete (C) There is a total shutdown of the affected resource. The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable.    Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   **Collateral Damage Potential**  ---   None (N) There is no potential for loss of life, physical assets, productivity or revenue. Low (L) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in slight physical or property damage. Or, there may be a slight loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.  Low-Medium (LM) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in moderate physical or property damage. Or, there may be a moderate loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.  Medium-High (MH) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in significant physical or property damage or loss. Or, there may be a significant loss of revenue or productivity.  High (H) A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in catastrophic physical or property damage and loss. Or, there may be a catastrophic loss of revenue or productivity.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   **Target Distribution**  ---   None (N) No target systems exist, or targets are so highly specialized that they only exist in a laboratory setting. Effectively 0% of the environment is at risk. Low (L) Targets exist inside the environment, but on a small scale. Between 1% - 25% of the total environment is at risk.  Medium (M) Targets exist inside the environment, but on a medium scale. Between 26% - 75% of the total environment is at risk.  High (H) Targets exist inside the environment on a considerable scale. Between 76% - 100% of the total environment is considered at risk.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   **Confidentiality Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers). Medium (M): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  High (H): Loss of confidentiality is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  Not Defined (ND): Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   **Integrity Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of integrity is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers). Medium (M): Loss of integrity is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  High (H): Loss of integrity is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  Not Defined (ND): Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High   **Availability Requirement**  ---   Low (L): Loss of availability is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).

High (H): Loss of availability is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).  Not Defined (ND): Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.    Environmental Score: 6.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software Resource Reservation Protocol Interface Queue Wedge Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20130925-rsvp  First Published: 2013 September 25 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2014 March 12 12:54 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuf17023](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf17023)     CVE-2013-5478     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2013-5478     CWE-20       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger an interface queue wedge on the affected device.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products Only devices with specific configurations are affected. Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software versions are vulnerable when they have RSVP enabled and also have one or more virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) interfaces. A device is vulnerable if both of the following criteria are met:    + At least one VRF instance is configured without RSVP   + At least one other interface (physical or virtual), not in the same VRF (or is in the global table), has RSVP enabled Some example scenarios are as follows:    + RSVP-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) infrastructures   + Multi-VRF infrastructures   + VRF-Lite infrastructures   + Cisco 7600 with MPLS enabledTo determine weather a device is enabled with RSVP, the best method is to use the **show ip rsvp** command-line interface exec (CLI) command. If the device is not configured with RSVP, the output will indicate that RSVP is disabled and is not enabled on any interface as shown in the following example: ```   Router#show ip rsvpRSVP: disabled (not enabled on any interface)   ``` If the device is configured with RSVP the output will indicate that RSVP is enabled as shown in the following example: ```   Router#show ip rsvpRSVP: enabled (on 1 interface(s))   ``` **Note:** Cisco 7600 Software images will enable RSVP on an internal VLAN context when MPLS is enabled on the device.      Only traffic directed to the device will trigger the vulnerability. Transit traffic will not trigger the vulnerability. Because this vulnerability can be exploited using UDP packets, the source of the packets may be spoofed. To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:    ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```    Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide" at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html>. Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco IOS NX-OS Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * A vulnerability in the RSVP feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger an interface queue wedge on the affected device.      The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of UDP RSVP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending UDP RSVP packets to the vulnerable device. An exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software to incorrectly process incoming packets, resulting in an interface queue wedge, which can lead to loss of connectivity, loss of routing protocol adjacency, and other DoS conditions.   In devices that meet the vulnerable configuration criteria, valid UDP RSVP packets could trigger this vulnerability. An attacker with knowledge of the infrastructure could craft valid RSVP packets with set conditions to exploit this vulnerability. Recovery from this interface queue wedge requires a reload of the device.      This vulnerability can be exploited using both RSVP over UDP over IPv4 and RSVP over UDP over IPv6 on UDP port 1698. Exploitation with UDP over IPv6 affects only Cisco IOS Software releases 15.2(3)T, 15.2(4)M, and later only.       An interface queue wedge is a class of vulnerability in which certain packets are received and queued by a Cisco IOS router or switch but, due to a processing error, are never removed from the queue. Consult the Workarounds section of this advisory for more information about queue wedges and some detection mechanisms that may be used to identify a blocked interface on Cisco IOS Software. Also see the Cisco Security Blog "Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained" at the following link: <http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/>      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco Bug ID [CSCuf17023](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf17023) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5478.  Workarounds  * The following identification mechanisms exist for this vulnerability:      **Embedded Event Manager**   A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect an interface queue wedge that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the interfaces for Cisco IOS device and detect when the interface input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations or reload the device to clear the input queue.      The Tcl script is available for download at the "Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community" at the following link: <https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337>      Also see the Cisco Security Blog "Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained" at the following link: <http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/>      The following mitigations exist for this vulnerability:      **IP RSVP Listener**      It is possible to mitigate this vulnerability under affected configurations by applying the global configuration command **ip rsvp listener vrf *vrf-name* *ip-address* udp *1698* announce**, where the IP address is one that does not exist on the device or in the routing tables.      **Infrastructure Access Control Lists (iACL) and Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)**   Because the feature in this vulnerability utilizes UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. In addition to ACLs, administrators should enable uRPF, a security feature of Cisco IOS Software that verifies the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The combination of these two technologies offers a stronger migration than iACLs alone.      Although it is often difficult to block traffic that transits a network, it is possible to identify traffic that should never be allowed to target infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of networks. Infrastructure ACLs (iACLs) are a network security best practice and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The iACL example below should be included as part of the deployed infrastructure access-list, which will help protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP address range: ```      !---!--- Feature: RSVP over UDP!---      access-list 150 permit udp TRUSTED_SOURCE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD        INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD eq 1698   !--- Deny RSVP over UDP traffic from all other sources destined !--- to infrastructure addresses.      access-list 150 deny udp any        INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD eq 1698   !--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 traffic in !--- accordance with existing security policies and !--- configurations. Permit all other traffic to transit the!--- device.      access-list 150 permit ip any any   !--- Apply access-list to all interfaces (only one example!--- shown)      interface fastEthernet 2/0    ip access-group 150 in   ``` The white paper entitled "Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists" presents guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure protection access lists and is available at the following link <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml>    **Control Plane Policing**    **Warning:** Because the feature in this vulnerability utilizes UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. Unicast RPF should be considered to be used in conjunction to offer a better mitigation solution.       Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block untrusted UDP traffic to the device. Cisco IOS software releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP can be configured on a device to help protect the management and control planes and minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The CoPP example below should be included as part of the deployed CoPP, which will help protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP address range. ```   !--- Feature: RSVP over UDP      access-list 150 deny udp TRUSTED_SOURCE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD        any eq 1698   !--- Deny RSVP over UDP traffic from all other sources destined !--- to the device control plane.      access-list 150 permit udp any any eq 1698   !--- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and !--- Layer4 traffic in accordance with existing security policies !--- and configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent !--- to infrastructure devices !--- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by!--- the CoPP feature      class-map match-all drop-udp-class    match access-group 150   !--- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the !--- Control-Plane of the device.      policy-map drop-udp-traffic    class drop-udp-class     drop   !--- Apply the Policy-Map to the !--- Control-Plane of the device      control-plane    service-policy input drop-udp-traffic   ``` In the above CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACEs) that match the potential exploit packets with the "permit" action result in these packets being discarded by the policy-map "drop" function, while packets that match the "deny" action (not shown) are not affected by the policy-map drop function. Please note that the policy-map syntax is different in the 12.2S and 12.0S Cisco IOS software trains: ```   policy-map drop-udp-traffic   class drop-udp-class   police 32000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action drop   ``` Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found in the documents, "Control Plane Policing Implementation Best Practices" and "Control Plane Policing" at the following links: <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html> and <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_4t/12_4t4/htcpp.html>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.       In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS Software Each row of the following Cisco IOS Software table corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software train. If a particular train is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the First Fixed Release column. The First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the September 2013 Bundled Publication column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all the published vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication.
