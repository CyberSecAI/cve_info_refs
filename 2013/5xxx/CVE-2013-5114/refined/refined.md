The provided content discusses vulnerabilities in the LastPass Android application, specifically related to its "secure container" implementation. The identified issues are assigned CVE-2013-5113 and CVE-2013-5114, with this blog focusing on CVE-2013-5114.

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the application's use of the `android:allowBackup="true"` setting in its AndroidManifest, which enables backing up and restoring application data via ADB. While this is a standard Android feature, LastPass did not properly protect sensitive data within the backup, allowing for manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Backup:** The application's configuration, including encoded PIN and password settings, is included in the backup created via `adb backup`. This backup can be extracted to the file system, examined, and modified.
*   **Insufficient PIN/Password Protection:** The application relies on a configuration file (`sp/LPandroid.xml`) where settings such as `reprompt_tries`, `passwordrepromptonactive`, `pincodeforreprompt`, and `requirepin` are stored. Manipulating these values in the backup and restoring it allows for bypassing PIN attempts limits and disabling the PIN protection entirely.
*  **Cloning Attack:** The backup of a LastPass application can be restored on another device, allowing attackers to access the LastPass vault using the original user's credentials, and keep access to the account even after the original user changes any of the saved passwords in LastPass. The application will update its vault from the LastPass servers after restart.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **PIN Bypass:**  An attacker can bypass the PIN protection of the LastPass application and access the vault.
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can access passwords and other sensitive data stored within LastPass.
*   **Account takeover:** An attacker can clone the LastPass setup on another device and maintain access to the vault, even after the original user changes their saved passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the target's Android device with USB debugging enabled.
*   **ADB:** The attacker uses `adb backup` to create a backup of the application data and `adb restore` to restore a modified backup.
*   **Backup Manipulation:** The attacker extracts the backup and modifies the `sp/LPandroid.xml` configuration file using an automated tool (Python script).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Access** to the victim's unlocked Android device.
*   **USB Debugging Enabled** on the victim's device.
*   **Knowledge** of how `adb backup` and `adb restore` work and the format of the Android backup files.
*   **Tooling** for unpacking, modifying, and repacking Android backups.
