        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way pdf.js handles iframe injection within an embed element. Specifically, any iframe appended as a child to an embed element used for PDF previewing will behave as if it's bound to the embed for previewing purposes. By setting the `src` attribute of the embed element to a local or chrome privileged file and then manipulating the `location` of the iframe's `contentWindow` to a `data:application/x-moz-playpreview-pdfjs;`, the code in `PdfRedirector.js` (which runs with full chrome privileges) loads the specified file into the frame.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Inadequate input validation in `PdfRedirector.js` when loading data into an iframe.",
          "Lack of checks to verify the data type before loading, allowing arbitrary local or chrome privileged files to be loaded."

        "impact": "An attacker can load local files or even chrome privileged pages into an iframe. This can allow information disclosure by reading the content of local files or confirming their existence.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating an embed element and injecting an iframe as its child, then setting the embed's `src` attribute to the desired file and the iframe's `contentWindow.location` to a specific data URL that triggers the vulnerable code path.",
