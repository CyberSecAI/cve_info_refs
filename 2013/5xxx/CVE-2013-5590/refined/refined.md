Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-5590:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is identified as "memory safety bugs in the browser engine". Specifically, these are related to issues in how memory is handled by the browser engine when processing web content. These issues could lead to memory corruption under specific circumstances.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Memory Safety Issues:** The core weakness lies in the incorrect handling of memory in the browser engine. This can lead to:
      -   **Memory Corruption:** The browser's memory can be corrupted.
      -   **Use-after-free:** Data might be accessed after it has been freed from memory.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
   -  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most serious potential impact is the possibility of remote attackers gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
   - **Denial of Service:** Crashes can lead to a denial of service

**4. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Web Pages:** A remote attacker could create a specially crafted web page designed to trigger these vulnerabilities. This is the most direct attack vector for a browser.
   -   **Emails (Potentially):** While scripting is often disabled by default in email clients, the description indicates a potential for exploitation in "browser-like contexts". This suggests that the vulnerability could be triggered through other avenues in an email client (like viewing remote content in an RSS feed) where Javascript is allowed.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, meaning they do not need any direct access to the victim's computer.
   - **User Interaction:** While not explicit, it is heavily implied that a user must be enticed to load or process the malicious content for the vulnerability to be triggered. (e.g., user has to visit the malicious page, or open an email with malicious content).

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple Mozilla products including:
    *   Firefox
    *   Firefox ESR
    *   SeaMonkey
    *   Thunderbird
    *   Thunderbird ESR
*   The vulnerability is explicitly described to be in the "browser engine".
*   It was addressed in specific releases for each product, with Firefox 25 being a major milestone for fixes.
*   The descriptions often mention the use of "ASAN fuzzing", which refers to Address Sanitizer, a tool used to detect memory corruption and access errors.
*   Some of the fixes involve checks for "non-finite" values in graphic drawing contexts which shows how these can cause crashes.

The information present in the different sources is consistent, although some offer more details than others.
