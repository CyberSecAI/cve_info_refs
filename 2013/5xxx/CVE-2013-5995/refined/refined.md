Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `SC_Helper_Address.php` file of EC-CUBE, specifically in how it handles customer IDs and other delivery address IDs. The code lacked proper checks to ensure that a user could only access and modify their own address information, leading to potential information disclosure and data manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper validation and authorization checks within the `SC_Helper_Address.php` file when handling customer IDs and delivery address IDs.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Due to the insufficient input validation, an attacker could potentially access and view other users' delivery address information.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The vulnerability could allow an attacker to modify the delivery address information of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to Personal Information:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive user data, such as names, addresses, and phone numbers, associated with other users.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers could potentially alter the delivery address information of other users, leading to potential delivery issues or other problems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability was exploited by manipulating input parameters related to customer and delivery address IDs.
*   **Front-End Feature Abuse:** The vulnerability was present in the front-end features of the application, accessible to logged-in users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user on the affected EC-CUBE platform.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs some expertise to manipulate parameters to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the EC-CUBE instance.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `SC_Helper_Address.php` file, specifically by adding checks and validations for customer and delivery address IDs.
*   The fix includes changes to the `registAddress`, `getAddress`, `getList`, and `deleteAddress` functions.
*   The fix ensures that users can only access and modify their own delivery address information, preventing unauthorized access and manipulation of other users' data.
