Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-5590 CVE-2013-5595 CVE-2013-5597 CVE-2013-5599
                 CVE-2013-5600 CVE-2013-5601 CVE-2013-5602 CVE-2013-5604

Multiple security issues have been found in iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: multiple memory safety errors, and
other implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

The iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no
longer supported with security updates.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.10esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

Attached file
[testcase (crashes firefox)](attachment.cgi?id=780586) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=780586&action=edit)

The attached testcase crashes the ASAN build of Firefox with the attached testcase.
It involves event handlers and exchange of \_\_proto\_\_ attributes, similar to [Bug 831090](/show_bug.cgi?id=831090 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - crash @Worker::SetEventListener with Worker and __proto__").

This looks like exactly the issue in [bug 831090](/show_bug.cgi?id=831090 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - crash @Worker::SetEventListener with Worker and __proto__"), but with a testcase that reproduces in a current build.

I see why I missed this. I filed [bug 899046](/show_bug.cgi?id=899046 "RESOLVED FIXED - Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window) is missing Worker until it is used").
Nils, how did your fuzzer get past [bug 899046](/show_bug.cgi?id=899046 "RESOLVED FIXED - Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window) is missing Worker until it is used")? Did you teach it specifically about workers?

Jesse, yes it knows about workers as part of one of it's modules.

The basic problem is in this code in js::baseops::SetPropertyHelper:
RootedObject pobj(cx);
RootedShape shape(cx);
if (!LookupPropertyWithFlags(cx, obj, id, cx->resolveFlags, &pobj, &shape))
return false;
if (shape) {
if (!pobj->isNative()) {
if (pobj->is<ProxyObject>()) {
AutoPropertyDescriptorRooter pd(cx);
if (!Proxy::getPropertyDescriptor(cx, pobj, id, &pd, JSRESOLVE\_ASSIGNING))
return false;
if ((pd.attrs & (JSPROP\_SHARED | JSPROP\_SHADOWABLE)) == JSPROP\_SHARED) {
return !pd.setter ||
CallSetter(cx, receiver, id, pd.setter, pd.attrs, pd.shortid, strict,
vp);
}
We look up the property on |frameText| from the testcase. That's a proxy, so we go through proxy handling and look it up on the underlying Text object.
Looking up on that, we recur into |w.\_\_proto\_\_|, which is from the original page (not the iframe page) and so is a proxy/wrapper. Lookups on proxies return |pobj == the proxy object| and |shape| is set to a bogus, non-null value by |MarkNonNativePropertyFound|.
So we have |shape|, |!pobj->isNative()|, and |pobj->is<ProxyObject>()|. We descend into the block containing the getPropertyDescriptor and such. The returned descriptor includes the actual JSStrictPropertyOp setter to be called.
JSStrictPropertyOp has a couple requirements. You have to pass in |shape->userid()| as id, not whatever was used for the lookup, so that the op gets what it expects (the shortid, not the id used for the lookup). That's the assert being hit here. In theory, if |pd.attrs & JSPROP\_SHORTID|, |pd.shortid| will be used by |CallSetter| and all will be well. But 1) |pd.attrs == 0x41| and |JSPROP\_SHORTID == 0x100| so no match, and 2) |pd.shortid == 0| -- and the underlying shape's propid\_ is "onmessage", despite having setter be Worker::SetEventListener. I'm not sure why that is, exactly -- conceivably that's the bug, maybe? That said, if memory serves, propertyop getters/setters can't assume they're passed an object of the kind they expect -- so GetEventListener/SetEventListener may need fixing in that case even if this (tiny|short)id nonsense needs fixing.
More investigation needed, not clearing needinfo yet.

No matter what we do on the JS engine side here, we should just stop using propertyops (with shortid at that!) on the worker side, imo...

That means converting everything to WebIDL and/or ditching the event implementation? We plan to do all of that.
If it means something more complex than that then ...

Well, converting to WebIDL will certainly do that. The question is whether there's a simpler switch to JSNative getters/setters we can do before then, and whether it's worthwhile.

Agreed about not using propertyops -- that holds everywhere, not just here. I also think we shouldn't be using shortids/tinyids, which would fall out of not using propertyops here, but which could be done independent of that (although I'm not sure it'd fix this bug, exactly). Exactly what set of changes will fix this, as minimally as possible, remains unclear. Ergo, more investigation.

Okay, this really seems to work. (Without crashing on shutdown because I called |worker->SetEventListener("onmessage", listener, rv)| rather than |worker->SetEventListener("message", listener, rv)|. Ugh. That should \*really\* be fixed so you're not specifying a string you could get wrong, via typos or whatever, at some point.)
The original code shouldn't have used propertyops and tinyids, but I'm not actually sure the JS engine's doing nothing wrong with this. I'll probably try to investigate more before declaring this patch a complete success/solution (to all possible instances of the problem, not just this specific one, if the ultimate issue is not specific to this worker code). But it seems worth getting the review-clock going while that happens. (Even if this can't land for a good long while because of uplift-cycle timing. Sigh.)

I considered investigating further to figure out whether the JS engine's at fault here or not. But it seems like it might be easier to search for all instances of PropertyOp/StrictPropertyOp properties and audit them:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=JSOP_WRAPPER>
What makes this relatively simple -- assuming I understand the uses sufficiently, and I need people to double-check me on this -- is that not all instances are actually exposed to untrusted code. Looking down the list of files in question:
js/src/ctypes/CTypes.cpp: trusted, not exposed to web -- no changes needed
js/src/perf/jsperf.cpp: trusted, not exposed to web -- no changes needed
js/src/builtin/RegExp.cpp: none of the instances here touch |obj| at all -- they go straight to RegExpStatics -- so no changes needed
js/src/shell/js.cpp: trusted, not exposed to web -- no changes needed
dom/workers/WorkerScope.cpp:
dom/workers/Exceptions.cpp:
dom/workers/File.cpp:
dom/workers/Events.cpp:
These are untrusted. But they \*only\* implement fields visible within workers. Workers can never observe a main-thread global object. Is there any way for them to observe some other global object, to trigger this cross-compartment issue? If there isn't, I don't think these need any changes.
There's one other possibility for the dom/workers/ hits -- that they can be triggered on an object using something like |new Proxy(relevantObjectInsideWorker, {})| and an access of one of the properties at issue. That needs investigation.
So I think there's only the direct-proxy issue to investigate, to determine that the fix posted here, is adequate to address every instance of the problem in Gecko -- regardless whether SpiderMonkey is or is not doing the right thing here. I'll want a double-check on this logic from some other JS engine person, of course, before declaring any sort of victory on this front, tho. :-)Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

Both the getter and setter here check that the class of the passed-in object is the expected class, so they should be fine.

The JS engine is definitely at fault here. More in a bit...

For what it's worth, this is a bit of a touchy subject. At least one distro offers the JS shell as a package for running JS. I don't know if that's still the case, though.

This definitely needs to be tested, but from my understanding of the problem here, these cases almost certainly need to be fixed. Also, the code at <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/gfx/skia/src/xml/SkJSDisplayable.cpp#183> might be affected by this.
> So I think there's only the direct-proxy issue to investigate, to determine

I'm wary of this approach, in part because it makes the SpiderMonkey API even harder to reason about than it already is. I'm all for simplifying the worker code to not use tinyids anymore, but doing only Worker.cpp seems incomplete and prone to error.
There are a couple of problems that lead to the assertion here: firstly, whether or not a js::Shape has a tinyid is not stored in its attrs but rather in its flags (!). This is why the attrs in [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=897678#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASAN SEGV on unknown address in Worker::SetEventListener") didn't include JSPROP\_SHORTID. Furthermore, js::DirectProxyHandler::getPropertyDescriptor uses jsapi.cpp:GetPropertyDescriptorById, which doesn't copy the tinyid from the shape \*and\* doesn't copy the information about the tinyid out of the shape's attrs anyway. Fixing that might be simple (and possibly enough) except that reading through JS\_DefineProperties, I think every property defined ends up with Shape::HAS\_SHORTID, so we'd probably want to fix that as well (unless I'm misreading the code).
I also find it kind of weird that we have two entirely different ways of calling setters: js::Shape::set and js::CallSetter. It was only through reading both of those methods that I noticed the attrs/flags distinction.
So I'd rather either ween workers off of tinyids entirely or just fix the immediate problems with tinyids here and be done with it.

Attached patch

[Fix all the workers code using propertyops](attachment.cgi?id=796399&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=796399&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=897678&attachment=796399)

The GetterOnlyJSNative bit (a native mimicking the behavior of js\_GetterOnlyPropertyStub) is partly paranoia, partly motivated by existing tests that think that setting some of these properties \*should\* throw errors even outside strict mode code. We can remove it on trunk, but it'll require fixing a bunch of tests. Not something to do now, for something we'd want to backport.
I forgot that Property<SLOT\_loaded>::Get will work even with old gcc, where GetProperty<SLOT\_loaded> won't. So that at least lets me get rid of N code-different function definitions to placate the JS\_PSG macro-calls in gcc 4.4.
I originally did all the functions without JS::CallNonGenericMethod. But doing so happened to trigger some fairly obscure "foo called on incompatible Proxy" errors in our own test suite. Given that, it seemed fairly risky to only spot-fix the ones needed to make mochitests pass, when it might break sites during a backport. (The old PropertyOp code didn't need this non-generic thing, because property ops semi-automatically get the unwrapped-y thing passed into them, not the proxy object.)
Double-checks of the IsFoo static methods are probably the most important thing -- if those over-accept stuff that's the easiest way for anything here to go off the rails.
The JS\_GetConstructor usage is hackitudinous, but given the precise scoping of it to immediately after the JS\_InitClass, it shouldn't be able to hit anything dodgy.
The WorkerScope.cpp getters technically should accept primitive |this| values, and work out the global object themselves in that case. But we're "saved" here because SpiderMonkey wrongly boxes primitives up into objects for implicit calls to accessor functions -- [bug 603201](/show_bug.cgi?id=603201 "RESOLVED FIXED - Strict getters on primitive wrapper prototypes receive wrapped |this| values"), [bug 869098](/show_bug.cgi?id=869098 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - SpiderMonkey is incorrectly boxing this when using strict accessors") -- so these don't need to do extra work now to work correctly. When those bugs are fixed, we'll have to circle back and fix this code accordingly.
This is a large-ish patch, but it's mostly pretty simple. I have more faith in its being correct, than I do in my understanding the existing interactions of tinyids in the JS engine, and "fixing" how tinyids work wrt proxies and proxied gets and stuff.
This passes try:

I'm working in branch backports now. Enough has changed at the periphery that blindly importing the patch here triggers a bunch of rejects, so I'm trying to get the branch-targeted work done before moving ahead on trunk.

At a glance, the vast majority of the differences are the result of s/JSBool/bool/g on trunk. Converting the few JSBool to bool in context, then reapplying the patch so the unchanged parts are picked up, appears as if it'll get the job done (of course, with another post-step afterward to revert bool->JSBool again).

Same extra set of fixes, plus some tweaks so that two uses of DOMException will work. (BindingUtils.h gets added to Exceptions.cpp, but that pulls in domstubs.h, which forward-declares a DOMException class. Then the two DOMException::\* calls near the end of that file are ambiguous between the anonymous-namespaced DOMException in the file, and the global forward-declaration of DOMException. I added anonymous-namespaced forwarding methods to resolve the ambiguity. Bleh. No idea why this issue doesn't exist on alpha/trunk, no real point finding out, either.)
The aurora backport patch built locally. The beta patch has built past dom/workers now. So these are probably good to go, but I'm going to finish this build and try them before declaring success.

Fix all the workers code using propertyops
[Security approval request comment]
How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?
Not super-easily. There's trickery to getting pointers lined up "just so" to avoid crashing, then to avoid it in usefully-exploitable ways. But this might be something heap-spraying would eat for breakfast, at cursory thought: I've never done the exercise of writing an exploit with invalid heap-memory use as vector, so I don't know for sure.
Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?
Nope.
Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?
All of them.
If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?
Probably dates back to the use of tinyids in this stuff in the first place. I suspect tinyids have been busted in the through-a-proxy case ever since proxies were introduced.
Do you have backports for the affected branches? If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?
Aurora/beta backports are finished. I don't have a b2g18 backport or an esr17 backport yet. None of this code has meaningfully changed in some time, but the JSAPI has changed substantially at the surface level -- JSBool->bool, adding handles to things, and so on -- such that creating backport patches involves a fair bit of tedium to apply the trunk patch's changes to older branches. Risk of such changes is pretty low, tho -- if they pass mochitests, they should be good.
How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?
Just for sheer quantity of changes, probably the branch-targeted backports want more than the two weeks of testing they'd get if landed now. :-\ I think, given there's no hint of the issue in the patch, we might land this September 17 (just after uplift) on trunk, then on branches a week or so later, for settling time. But up to you if you think it's worth pushing on this sooner.

I do appreciate the work to create the branch patches proactively, but that's a much bigger chunk of change than we're comfortable taking on beta this close to release. And thankfully the patch is opaque so we're not forced to take it by landing on M-C.
We will want esr-17 fixes for 25 (don't land until after the merge). Not sure about b2g18--this won't make the 1.1 release and I think 1.2 is based on a further branch point, but we'll almost certainly have at least one 1.1 update worth of fixes (1.1.1?) before 1.2

Yeah, it looks like only esr24 even sort of worked. The unfortunate reality of landing on old branches is that you have to use the branch itself as try server...

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2013-101

## Memory corruption in workers

Announced
October 29, 2013
Reporter
Nils
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Firefox ESR, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, Thunderbird ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox 25
* Firefox ESR 17.0.10
* Firefox ESR 24.1
* SeaMonkey 2.22
* Thunderbird 24.1
* Thunderbird ESR 17.0.10

### Description

Security researcher **Nils** used the Address Sanitizer tool
while fuzzing to discover a memory corruption issue with the JavaScript engine
when using workers with direct proxies. This results in a potentially
exploitable crash.

In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the
Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is
potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1023863#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-10-28 06:53:42 UTC  ``` Security researcher Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover an access violation when Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) are processed with uninitialized data. This leads to a potentially exploitable crash.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-95.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Abhishek Arya as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1023863#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-29 21:17:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1476 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1476.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1023863#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-30 16:32:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1480 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1480.html>   ``` |  |

An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available. It
includes four new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox has been updated to the 17.0.10ESR release,
which fixes various bugs and security issues:
\*
MFSA 2013-93: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
Jesse Ruderman and Christoph Diehl reported memory
safety problems and crashes that affect Firefox ESR 17,
Firefox ESR 24, and Firefox 24. (CVE-2013-5590)
Carsten Book reported a crash fixed in the NSS
library used by Mozilla-based products fixed in Firefox 25,
Firefox ESR 24.1, and Firefox ESR 17.0.10.(CVE-2013-1739)
\*
MFSA 2013-95 / CVE-2013-5604: Security researcher
Abhishek Arya (Inferno) of the Google Chrome Security Team
used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover an access
violation due to uninitialized data during Extensible
Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) processing. This
leads to a potentially exploitable crash.
\*
MFSA 2013-96 / CVE-2013-5595: Compiler Engineer Dan
Gohman of Google discovered a flaw in the JavaScript engine
where memory was being incorrectly allocated for some
functions and the calls for allocations were not always
properly checked for overflow, leading to potential buffer
overflows. When combined with other vulnerabilities, these
flaws could be potentially exploitable.
\*
MFSA 2013-98 / CVE-2013-5597: Security researcher
Byoungyoung Lee of Georgia Tech Information Security Center
(GTISC) used the Address Sanitizer tool to discover a
use-after-free during state change events while updating
the offline cache. This leads to a potentially exploitable
crash.
\*
MFSA 2013-100: Security researcher Nils used the
Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to discover missing
strong references in browsing engine leading to
use-after-frees. This can lead to a potentially exploitable
crash.
o ASAN heap-use-after-free in
nsIPresShell::GetPresContext() with canvas, onresize and
mozTextStyle (CVE-2013-5599) o ASAN use-after-free in
nsIOService::NewChannelFromURIWithProxyFlags with Blob URL
(CVE-2013-5600) o ASAN use-after free in GC allocation in
nsEventListenerManager::SetEventHandler (CVE-2013-5601)
\*
MFSA 2013-101 / CVE-2013-5602: Security researcher
Nils used the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to
discover a memory corruption issue with the JavaScript
engine when using workers with direct proxies. This results
in a potentially exploitable crash.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1476)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to terminate
unexpectedly or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running Firefox. (CVE-2013-5590, CVE-2013-5597, CVE-2013-5599,
CVE-2013-5600, CVE-2013-5601, CVE-2013-5602)

It was found that the Firefox JavaScript engine incorrectly allocated
memory for certain functions. An attacker could combine this flaw with
other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Firefox. (CVE-2013-5595)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain Extensible Stylesheet
Language Transformations (XSLT) files. An attacker could combine this flaw
with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running Firefox. (CVE-2013-5604)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Jesse Ruderman, Christoph Diehl, Dan Gohman,
Byoungyoung Lee, Nils, and Abhishek Arya as the original reporters of these
issues.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 17.0.10 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 17.0.10 ESR, which corrects these issues. After installing
the update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

All firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-31.5.3"

```

All firefox-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-31.5.3"

```

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/thunderbird-31.5.0"

```

All thunderbird-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=mail-client/thunderbird-bin-31.5.0"

```

All seamonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-2.33.1"

```

All seamonkey-bin users should upgrade to the latest version:

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A1480)

## Topic

An updated thunderbird package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Mozilla Thunderbird is a standalone mail and newsgroup client.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed content. Malicious
content could cause Thunderbird to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5590,
CVE-2013-5597, CVE-2013-5599, CVE-2013-5600, CVE-2013-5601, CVE-2013-5602)

It was found that the Thunderbird JavaScript engine incorrectly allocated
memory for certain functions. An attacker could combine this flaw with
other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5595)

A flaw was found in the way Thunderbird handled certain Extensible
Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) files. An attacker could combine
this flaw with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Thunderbird. (CVE-2013-5604)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Jesse Ruderman, Christoph Diehl, Dan Gohman,
Byoungyoung Lee, Nils, and Abhishek Arya as the original reporters of these
issues.

Note: All of the above issues cannot be exploited by a specially-crafted
HTML mail message as JavaScript is disabled by default for mail messages.
They could be exploited another way in Thunderbird, for example, when
viewing the full remote content of an RSS feed.

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Thunderbird 17.0.10 ESR. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this erratum.

All Thunderbird users should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains Thunderbird version 17.0.10 ESR, which corrects these issues.
After installing the update, Thunderbird must be restarted for the changes
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1023844#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2013-10-28 04:44:38 UTC  ``` Security researcher Nils used the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing to discover a memory corruption issue with the JavaScript engine when using workers with direct proxies. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.  In general this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird and Seamonkey products because scripting is disabled, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-101.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Nils as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1023844#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-29 21:16:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:1476 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1476.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1023844#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-30 16:32:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2013:1480 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1480.html>   ``` |  |
