Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the relevant details regarding CVE-2013-5602:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory corruption issue exists within the JavaScript engine of Mozilla Firefox when using workers with direct proxies. This occurs when properties are accessed on a proxy object within a worker, and the property access logic doesn't handle the cross compartment proxying correctly, leading to an incorrect shortid being used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of `PropertyOp` and `StrictPropertyOp` with shortids on worker objects, which are not designed to be used across compartments.
- Incorrect handling of tinyids and properties on proxy objects, within worker threads.
- Memory safety issues when accessing objects within worker threads using a proxy.
- Vulnerable propertyop setters, particularly the `SetEventListener` in `Worker.cpp`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potentially exploitable crash, leading to possible arbitrary code execution.
- Memory corruption.
- Denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by accessing a property on a proxy object within a worker thread, that is implemented using propertyops and tinyids.
- An attacker could craft a malicious webpage with javascript code that triggers the vulnerability using worker threads and proxy objects.
- The issue can be triggered by manipulating the `__proto__` property.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create or modify webpage.
- Ability to use JavaScript and worker threads.
- Needs to understand how to structure the worker and proxy objects to trigger this issue.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered using the Address Sanitizer tool while fuzzing.
- The issue stems from incorrect handling of how shortids are used on properties defined using `PropertyOp` or `StrictPropertyOp` and how these interact with proxies.
- The fix involves moving away from using `PropertyOp` on worker objects by using native getters and setters.

- Patches were created for various versions of Firefox, including ESR releases, showing the widespread impact.
- Backporting was complex due to API changes between different versions, requiring adjustments like  `JSBool` to `bool` changes.

- The vulnerability is considered "sec-critical" highlighting its severity.

**Summary of exploitation:**

An attacker can exploit a memory corruption bug by crafting a specific JavaScript code that creates workers, uses proxies, and manipulates object properties across compartments leading to an exploitable crash and potential arbitrary code execution

**Additional notes:**
- The root cause is a logic error in how property operations interact with proxy objects in different compartments when workers are involved.
- The use of tinyids and propertyops, in this context, seems to be the key element that leads to the vulnerability, highlighting the need to migrate away from them.
