Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2013-5639:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation of user-supplied input passed via the `gnew_language` cookie. This cookie value is used in an `include()` function call within the `/users/login.php` script without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP File Inclusion (CWE-98):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary local files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including and executing arbitrary PHP code, attackers can potentially gain full control of the vulnerable system.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP request that sets the `gnew_language` cookie.
- **Directory Traversal:** Attackers use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../`) to navigate the file system and reach the target file.
- **URL-Encoded NULL Byte:**  The `%00` character is used to terminate the file path, which could be helpful in some cases.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker must be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was found in Gnew version 2013.1 and potentially earlier versions.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by setting a cookie, which makes it relatively easy for attackers to attempt.
